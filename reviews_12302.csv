review,result
A fantasy adventure that fuses Greek mythology to contemporary American places and values. Anyone around 15 (give or take a couple of years) will thrill to the visual spectacle,Fresh
"Uma Thurman as Medusa, the gorgon with a coiffure of writhing snakes and stone-inducing hypnotic gaze is one of the highlights of this bewitching fantasy",Fresh
"With a top-notch cast and dazzling special effects, this will tide the teens over until the next Harry Potter instalment.",Fresh
"Whether audiences will get behind The Lightning Thief is hard to predict. Overall, it's an entertaining introduction to a promising new world -- but will the consuming shadow of Potter be too big to break free of?",Fresh
"What's really lacking in The Lightning Thief is a genuine sense of wonder, the same thing that brings viewers back to Hogwarts over and over again.",Rotten
It's more a list of ingredients than a movie-magic potion to enjoy from start to finish.,Rotten
Harry Potter knockoffs don't come more transparent and slapdash than this wannabe-franchise jumpstarter directed by Chris Columbus.,Rotten
"Percy Jackson isn't a great movie, but it's a good one, trotting out kernels of Greek mythology like so many Disney Channel references.",Fresh
"Fun, brisk and imaginative",Fresh
"Crammed with dragons, set-destroying fights and things exploding, [Columbus] squeezes in a few well-meaning pause breaks about friendship and absent fathers before swiftly moving on to the next pyrotechnics display.",Fresh
"This action-packed fantasy adventure, based on Rick Riordan's hit Percy Jackson and the Olympians series of books, is great fun, and deserves to find an audience with teens now bereft of any Harry Potter magic.",Fresh
"For what it is and for whom it is intended, it's not a bad movie, just an indifferent one.",Rotten
"Chris Columbus returns to his comfort zone for this mirthless, episodic fantasy saga based on the young-reader book series by Rick Riordan.",Rotten
The best thing you can say about Chris Columbus's adaptation is that he's incapable of destroying whatever magic and wonder it is in these books that has kept kids coming back for more.,Fresh
This cast is simply too generic. None of the young thespians stick out.,Rotten
"Percy Jackson may not be ""Harry Potter good,"" but kids will really enjoy it and parents will be happy to have a moviethey can bring them to that's family-friendly.",Fresh
"[P]erfectly inoffensive, occasionally clever... It's in the few genuinely cinematically joyful moments, the ones that do rise above the formula, that you realize how much more this could have been...",Fresh
"Admirably, the movie isn't bogged down in the exposition common to first entries, but at the end, it's a franchise searching for its voice.",Rotten
The main thing this movie seems to be missing is classically trained British actors.,Fresh
"When the movie slows down to catch its breath, there's very little of the heart and soul -- and wry wit -- that make the Riordan books so beloved.",Rotten
"Imperfect, yes, but also both suitably imaginative and entertaining. Works as action-adventure razzle-dazzle, coming-of-age tale, and beginners' lesson on Greek mythology.",Fresh
"Although the standard allegorical bases for mythical-quest movies are dutifully covered, the obvious similarity of Percy Jackson to the Harry Potter movies inevitably makes it feel somewhat secondhand.",Rotten
"A little bit worse than lifeless; it's clueless, like a Medusa running around with her head cut off.",Rotten
You don't even have to be familiar with the first book in Rick Riordan's popular fantasy series to enjoy Chris Columbus' energetic adaptation.,Fresh
"This is generic filmmaking at its most banal, a simple-minded simplification of a not overwhelmingly complex book.",Rotten
"Kids may well enjoy the adventures of The Lightning Thief on screen, but I think most readers will prefer the movie in their imaginations.",Rotten
An attempt to steal some of Harry Potter's thunder that also stands on its own as a well-made large-scale adventure that works well enough to entertain the teens it's hoping to strike.,Fresh
"With great effects (and a few surprises) it's a fun, Saturday-matinee adventure.",Fresh
Columbus directs with his usual frying pan to the head. Music is forever swelling majestically. Characters are always opening wide their eyes and mouths to gaze in wonder.,Rotten
"While this might not rival the later, better Harry Potter movies or the Lord of the Rings trilogy, it's more fun than you might expect.",Fresh
"Percy Jackson & the Olympians sounds like an Otis Redding cover band. It is, instead, an unofficial cover of the Harry Potter franchise.",Rotten
The movie feels like a cut-rate Potter knockoff with a dash of Ray Harryhausen.,Rotten
"In Columbus' hands, it once again all breaks down into a series of rushed, breathless special-effects setpieces, in a thrill ride that isn't headed anywhere new.",Rotten
The Lightning Thief makes the idea of a sequel seem like an inviting proposition.,Fresh
"Columbus aims at nothing more than providing a rambunctious romp. He nimbly avoids the fate that has snared other film adaptations, like Eragon and Inkheart.",Fresh
gets so many things right that when it goes astray that you kind of wish it hadn't tried in the first place,Rotten
"The Lightning Thief isn't electric, but it generates some spark when it varies the Grecian formula.",Fresh
"Chris Columbus and his crew take a literal approach to spectacle that denies the magnificent use of weirdness and scale that famed stop-action animator Ray Harryhausen brought to such myth-inspired classics as ""Jason and the Argonauts"" (1963)...",Fresh
"Even with all its computer-generated fireballs, it's lukewarm medium-budget blockbustering.",Rotten
"The disappearance of lightning simply is not interesting, and Percy Jackson and the Olympians sounds more like a '70s funk band than a kid's series.",Rotten
Uma Thurman demonstrates she can wear a snake-covered head as gracefully as Pierce Brosnan can trot around with a horse's netherlands.,Fresh
The Greek-gods premise lets the filmmakers indulge in some visually whizzy sequences that keep this rather lightweight action movie entertaining.,Fresh
"Of all the players, Uma Thurman channels the Bride to deliver a Medusa the children won't easily forget when it comes to bedtime.",Fresh
"Enjoyable, nicely paced family adventure with likeable characters, a strong central premise and some decent set-pieces, though the plot's a little hazy in places and the humour doesn't always work.",Fresh
"Action movies of this scale often start off strong and wind down to forgettable finales, but Percy Jackson is the opposite, overcoming a clunky setup to deliver nearly all its thrills in the last half-hour.",Fresh
The Lightning Thief is all crass ineptitude and lost potential. Columbus' infantilizing of any character depth and use of leftover Harry Potter special effects will amuse only the smallest in your pantheon.,Rotten
"The plot is a pretty blatant rehash of the typical ""coming-of-age hero"" tropes. Still, while ""Percy Jackson"" may not end up being the next huge and successful franchise, at the very least, it was an honest and amusing two hours.",Rotten
"Young viewers probably will be entertained but even they are likely to realize that this could have and should have been better, especially by the time they're old enough to drive.",Rotten
It raises issues it doesn't have the balls to resolve by placing them in a context it doesn't have the brains to exploit.,Rotten
Whew boy.,Rotten
My problems with it are the same as with most screen adaptations of young adult novels...they spend so much time struggling to explain the world they're creating that they forget which parts of the story people want to see...they figure that people (kids),Rotten
Sadly worthy of its dumping into the cinematic boneyard of wintry mid-February.,Rotten
"The camera work is frequently pedestrian, the acting is bland, and the jokes often fall flat.",Rotten
Director Chris Columbus has brought together the modern and mythical spheres with sharp pacing and a nifty sense of fun that atone for the film's dippier moments. It's his most enjoyable effort since Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets.,Fresh
"Dutifully Potteresque it begins, and dutifully Potteresque it ends.",Rotten
"Has all the CGI sorcery of a Harry Potter pic, but none of the magic.",Rotten
Columbus knows his way around this kind of material even if some of the special effects look like they came from Deep Discount.,Rotten
"Percy Jackson, you are no Harry Potter. You are not fit to walk in a hobbit's wake.",Rotten
Too scary for younger fans of the popular book.,Rotten
The pleasant surprise is how deftly the story translates the myths from their classical idiom into modern ones and without losing the classical flavor,Fresh
"...great fun for the whole family. And if it introduces you and any young readers in your home to the books, so much the better.",Fresh
"Sorry Mr. Jackson, but Harry Potter you ain't.",Rotten
"A clunky kid-sized epic, able to conjure colossal acts of Greek myth wonderment, but never brave enough to shut its pie hole and let the audience process the screen magic.",Rotten
Harry Potter meets Clash of the Titans ‚Ä¶ The backdrop of Greek mythology makes an enjoyable change of pace from the medieval fantasy magic of the Potter stories.,Fresh
"While winning the award for longest movie title, it is a film that only goes through the motions.",Rotten
Not without bright moments ... but the story is centered around a trio of young actors who simply aren't operating at the same skill level as their older costars.,Fresh
"Built with set pieces that demonstrate a real affection for Greek myth iconography and centered on a strong performance by Logan Lerman (a star in the making), Percy Jackson & The Olympians aims young and hits the target fairly consistently.",Fresh
It's not awful. It's just not particularly inspired. Something tells me this movie won't be inspiring a sequel anytime soon.,Rotten
Parental Content Review,Fresh
"Harry, Ron and Hermione: Relax. You could whip Percy Jackson and his pals with your wand hands tied behind your backs.",Rotten
"The film toggles between high camp and deadly earnestness, all the while threatening to drown in an ocean of not-so-special effects.",Rotten
"Likable as Percy may be, it's not lightning he's stolen.",Rotten
This is a kids' movie: Parents can either get into the silly-suspenseful spirit of it or play Rummikub on their iPhones.,Fresh
"While it certainly isn't terrible, it plays like a low-rent variation of the Harry Potter formula--innocuous but instantly forgettable.",Rotten
All you have at the end of it is an enervating feeling of deja vu.,Rotten
"Like its stars, the film is genial good company.",Fresh
It's apparent that Potter may at last have a worthy successor.,Fresh
"Unfortunately, the movie lacks that good old Potter charm, trading Harry's dark whimsy for a handful of CGI magic beans.",Rotten
"There are lots of cool surprises along the way, and the special effects are fantastic, especially the ones that create Uma Thurman's Medusa snakedo.",Fresh
"Columbus and company have crafted an agreeable mythological jaunt the whole family will enjoy, and while I wouldn't pay more than matinee prices that still means making the quest to the multiplex is a journey worthy of the undertaking.",Fresh
Lerman has a presence even with a mouth full of bad dialogue.,Fresh
This film is replete with plot holes.,Rotten
Some moments of inspired silliness save this escapist adventure from complete dullness.,Rotten
"A dull, scattershot affair that owes much to both X-Men and Greek mythology but which never seems to slow down enough to make any sense whatsoever.",Rotten
...an agreeable fantasy adventure that should leave fans of the genre satisfied.,Fresh
"Director Columbus never quite gets comfortable juggling the film's myriad characters, grandiose-but-stale CGI effects, and PG-friendly battle scenes, speeding headlong through endless plot points rather than taking the time to make any of them matter.",Rotten
"This is what a quality book adaptation should do, stand on it's own, while making you want to explore more. But JESUS! Can we stop the Apple Product Placements! I don't want to see a freaking iPhone in a Fantasy film!!!",Fresh
"Despite so much epic drama in Greek mythology from which to borrow, here we are given little sense of the magnitude of the clash between the quarrelsome gods...",Rotten
"It would be an easy slam review. But if you like big pretty toy commercials, it's plenty of fun.",Fresh
"""It is a bit hard to see quite where Percy Jackson and the Lightening Thief's market lies. Too adult for juveniles, too juvenile for adults.",Fresh
"there's not one single thing in it that will appeal to a person who has ever seen a mythological origin story before, much less any other sort of adventure movie.",Rotten
So trite and ludicrous it is no threat to the Harry Potter franchise,Rotten
...an attempt to replicate the phenomenon that is Harry Potter.,Rotten
I thought it was mischievous and witty and amusing and I was just sort of drawn into it.,Fresh
"Maybe if you're aged between eight and 12, or exceptionally dim-witted, you may not notice that this is a tenth-rate rip-off of Harry Potter, with Greek mythology taking the place of magic.",Rotten
"The technical wizardry is spectacular and the story is taut, pacy and consistently inventive.",Fresh
"The film is a rousing blend of special effects, but not so scary that children aged seven and above will spend the entire movie hiding behind their fingers.",Fresh
Percy Jackson & the Olympians is a dutifully made kids' fantasy film that Columbus handles with the basic approach that he wielded on his faithful but vanilla Harry Potter adaptations.,Rotten
"Chris Columbus was a safe choice behind the lens, and he doesn't throw up any surprises. Columbus brings a measured approach that works on the whole, delivering the expected mix of set-ups, set-pieces and edge of your seat showdowns.",Fresh
"An imaginative, if simplistic, visit to classical Greek mythology, an archetypal quest by a lad with paternal issues.",Fresh
"It's not enough to compensate for the computer-game-style plotting, which is largely based on us picking up narrative nuggets that mechanically slot into place later on.",Rotten
"Kids will love it, and adults may relish Pierce Brosnan's Centaur, and Steve Coogan as Hades - in his personal hell just under Hollywood.",Fresh
A slab of market research in search of an actual movie.,Rotten
"The tone is not always certain, but the special effects are as spectacular as and the mythological underpinning more compelling than anything in the Harry Potter series.",Fresh
Percy Jackson manages to make Greek mythology both fun and exciting and is sure to appeal to its key demographic.,Fresh
"Not bad, but JK Rowling can rest easy.",Fresh
There's plenty of larks to be had from a fast-moving fantasy that doesn't take its mythology too seriously and employs actors who don't look like teenage rabbits in headlights.,Fresh
"While you suspect it's really just a big Clash Of The Titans spoiler, there's enough action in Jackson to make it succeed on its own terms. Lerman's a likeable lead, though it's the game supporting cast that keeps you watching.",Fresh
"It's evidently Potter-ish, but unashamedly aimed at younger viewers - which makes the emphasis on the junior hero's fighting skills and a clearly misguided Las Vegas casino sequence all the more dismaying.",Rotten
"While the Hogwarts saga may be getting long in the tooth, at least it has decent characters and a sense of humour. This has neither.",Rotten
"It is great to see Greek Mythology taking centre stage, even if people must say ""no way"", ""yes way"" when faced with a fire-breathing hydra.",Fresh
Digitisation reigns - spectacular visual effects - while the dialogue drizzles and sploshes.,Rotten
"If they'd played it for laughs it might just have worked, but in fact its earnest tone and digimation effects stick pretty close to the Potter model. We could be in for a very long haul.",Rotten
"Very American, very crass and very underwhelming.",Rotten
"The story is told in bland, episodic fashion with no sense of drama or threat.",Rotten
This ineffably wooden Chris Columbus adaptation of author Rick Riordan's best-seller for young teens has a screenplay that defies description.,Rotten
"It's fantastic fun, it knows its Greek mythology, and it's a very promising start to a franchise. More of the same, please.",Fresh
Remember the first time you saw Harry Potter on the big screen? This is more like the third time you saw him but with bigger effects and Greek mythology replacing the occult.,Fresh
"An awful lot of acting talent goes to waste in this film, but there is barely enough here to marginally satisfy the younger set.",Fresh
The Greek gods had outsized powers and petty grievances. These Gen-Y demigods are no different - it's a whole generation of kids with daddy issues,Rotten
Grand prize goes to Uma Thurman as snake-headed Medusa. It's also a pleasure to see Steve Coogan in hell.,Fresh
"The whole thing is piffle, but it moves fast enough to stay entertaining.",Fresh
"A fun, effects-filled, escapist adventure, with several clever notions: Medusa sells garden statuary as a cover, and the Parthenon in Nashville is home to a hydra.",Fresh
"A safe, bland, test-marketed product made for tween mass consumption. Like most films arriving with ampersands and colons in the title, it's a bore.",Rotten
"It looks like the characters of color in Percy Jackson have been paired off, a remarkable choice in a movie that is, in essence, about the glories of half-breeds.",Rotten
"It's all jolly good fun, rattling along at a perfect pace with enough action setpieces and spectacle to keep both youngsters and adults happy.",Fresh
What surprised me is that I had some affection for an action adventure film the way I would have in the days of the Ray Harryhausen's best films.,Fresh
"Another attempted launch of a teen-aimed franchise, but this show-boat is rowing through the motions. Seen-that, been-there fantasy-epic stuff with dialogue more wooden and hollow than the Trojan Horse.",Rotten
"While this flick may not have Harry Potter's complex world and multiple layers, it also doesn't have the angst and darkness. It replaces them with one thing in bulk: Fun.",Fresh
... a sprightly Harry Potter clone and an eye-candy-coated intro to Greek mythology.,Fresh
click to read full review,Rotten
"Of all the would-be Potter projects that have hit the screen over the years, this is one of more polished and enjoyable ones.",Rotten
"A great family film, with just the right measures of action, mythological allusions, humor, and adventure.",Fresh
"Not a perfect film, but the movie does have a certain passion that a lot of other franchise attempts have lacked. If you like Greek mythology and are looking for an antidote to Clash of the Titans, this may be what you're looking for.",Fresh
Mildly diverting.,Rotten
"Just another mediocre fantasy flick, but if you enjoyed the books, I'm sure you'll enjoy the film.",Rotten
"An enjoyable PG-rated family adventure in its own right, but Columbus' film can't live up to the Potter gold standard, and it strays enough from Riordan's source material to make its tween readership blow a gasket every few minutes. [Blu-ray]",Fresh
Percy Jackson & the Olympians: The Lightning Thief proves to be a satisfying beginning to what is sure to be a promising film franchise.,Fresh
Manages to pay its respects to the Greek myths and actually convey them as fun.,Fresh
It kind of just builds up to a lot of Not Much.,Rotten
"Percy Jackson is simply uninspired in every single meaning of the word. It's probably the crassest, most obviously derivative work of this sort since Eragon.",Rotten
The premise of Percy Jackson & the Olympians: The Lightning Thief holds great potential potential the film never realizes.,Rotten
It provides a great adventure movie for the family audience.,Fresh
The plot uses the presence of the Greek gods as an indistinct outline to influence teenagers who are more interested in the prestige and glamor of their connection than the responsibility that comes with it.,Rotten
"As a former middle school teacher of gifted literature, I value all fairly well-made films for children and parents and this one is in that league.",Fresh
The Lightning Thief is an admirable kid's fantasy.,Fresh
"OK, but only just.",Rotten
There's nothing resembling a spark in this film anywhere.,Rotten
"Like Holofcener's previous pictures, Please Give derives its narrative energy less from a series of plotted incidents than from its keenly observed interplay of clashing personality tics and worldviews.",Fresh
"A muted, almost Rohmer-like moral tale that doesn't quite dive deeply enough into its several characters.",Rotten
"Keener, Peet and Hall all shine as women plagued with self-doubt who respond to those insecurities in strikingly different ways.",Fresh
"An edgy, somber, beautifully written Manhattan fable of guilt, shame, infidelity, death and real estate.",Fresh
"Holofcener always gives us more to chew on than originally meets the eye in her films and she writes female characters with an intelligence, sensitivity and realism that blows the Sex and the City foursome away any day of the week.",Fresh
"The tone is low-key but very funny. Yet, at the same time, the film also manages to have a sardonic edge.",Fresh
"Of a piece with Nicole Holofcener's three other films -- talky, urbane ensemble flicks that elicit quiet but deeply sincere smiles and laughs, and just as often showcase hushed moments of pinprick vulnerability.",Fresh
"A witty and observant comedy of manners, Please Give is another understated gem from writer-director Nicole Holofcener.",Fresh
Solid ensemble work with an especially good Catherine Keener.,Fresh
"It's a tricky kind of social satire, its possibly cloying self-absorption cut only by some winningly awkward characters.",Fresh
"The fourth teaming of gifted indie filmmaker Holofcener and talented actress Keener is a timely, sharply observed, femme-driven serio-comedy about postmodern capitalistic lifestyles with all their joys, guilts, complexities and contradictions.",Fresh
"Ah, the guilt of the privileged.",Rotten
An engagingly high-strung comedy about lack of empathy and the gnawing guilt that can attend it.,Fresh
Holofcener's humorous interest in yupscale entitlem.ent and its discontents mark her as a descendant of Woody Allen,Fresh
"Please Give is specific about its middle-class, white, Manhattan characters but it's also universal in the way one social class' anxieties are understood rather than simply celebrated.",Fresh
One of the best movies ever about guilt as the guardian of our goodness and a sign of our yearning to belong to the larger world.,Fresh
"[Holofcener] has real sympathy -- characters that might have been brittle, mockable creations in another writer-director's hands gain resonance here.",Fresh
"At a time when every penny counts, where do they come up with the money to finance a movie this boring?",Rotten
"Such fine-tuned observation requires the ideal interpreter. Keener has always been Holofcener's muse, and once again offers the sort of fully crafted portrait that reminds us how shallow most movies really are.",Fresh
"With her new film, the poignant and funny Please Give, Holofcener is at the top of her game.",Fresh
"Sometimes -- and far too rarely -- a film will hit all the right notes, with sharp, original dialogue, brilliant casting and an absorbing story. So caught up in its spell, you dread seeing the credits roll. Please Give is that movie.",Fresh
"Listening to the banter in Please Give feels like eavesdropping on natural conversations, shaped and selected by a skilled storyteller.",Fresh
"With the romantic notion of the deceased 'haunting' their furniture..., the director at once adds some ethereal spirituality and an earthbound connection between people and their possessions.",Fresh
"Keener, Peet, and Hall are so strong, so empathetic even at their weakes",Fresh
Some people might find it distasteful to make a movie about guilty rich folks who give themselves permission to splurge. Others will rightly appreciate the honesty.,Fresh
Holofcener's deliciously understated film takes a miniaturist's pleasure in getting the details right.,Fresh
"One of the best movies of the year so far. An insightful, darkly funny and multi-layered character study about class and family.",Fresh
"Few American filmmakers create female characters as realistically funny, attractively imperfect and flat-out annoying as does Ms. Holofcener.",Fresh
"Hardly a treasure, but it offers some modest rewards.",Fresh
Two possible ways of regarding Please Give: It's shallow. Or maybe it's deeply shallow.,Rotten
"If giving is always a relationship, giving also entails taking, whether in business, romance or family interactions.",Fresh
"Please Give is Holofcener's best movie to date. The slender plot presents itself without fuss, a slice of Manhattan life, a la Woody Allen's early, most engaging work.",Fresh
"This gorgeous film, always tender and sometimes dark, is a deeply resonant comic drama that's concerned with nothing less than life, death, love, sex, guilt and the urban logic of mortality.",Fresh
"Fleetingly amusing, charming and harmless with a terrific cast, but often meanders, lacks bite, and unevenly juggles comedy, drama and romance.",Rotten
"Holofcener's touch isn't light, but it is funny in its exploration of materialism and guilt, vanity and aging.",Fresh
"[Although] I think Holofcener's work is always interesting, I think this is the least satisfying of all her films I've seen.",Rotten
"Brutally honest about the way people behave, and often devastatingly funny in its observations.",Fresh
Don't be put off by the bitchy-familiar chick-flick wrapper. This one's a keeper.,Fresh
Funny and heartbreaking.,Fresh
"Forget the dreaded ""Sex and the City 2."" Holofcener's wonderful new film about mammograms, marriage, infidelity, child-rearing and waiting for the old lady next door to die so you can buy her sprawling, pre-WWII apartment is the most sophisticated America",Fresh
"Please Give is a moral comedy that feels at times like one of the late Eric Rohmer's deceptively breezy miniatures, or a mid-period Woody Allen movie - the fussiness.",Fresh
"In its casual, disarming way, it's as deep and as grand a film as you'll find",Fresh
Holofcener explores the contemporary female experience with a camera that is at once empathetic and merciless.,Fresh
This is one of those rare movies that made me want to thank the person who did it.,Fresh
"The movie is about imperfect characters in a difficult world, who mostly do the best they can under the circumstances, but not always. Do you realize what a revolutionary approach that is for a movie these days?",Fresh
"It's a wonderful movie full of people you wish you knew in real life, and like most of Holofcener's movies, it's a remarkable combination of comedy and tragedy.",Fresh
"Please Give is a series of such set-piece scenes, a breezy, though not negligible, exploration of the contest between avarice and empathy.",Fresh
Only Rebecca Hall comes through with a genuineness that rises above Holofcener's doodlings.,Rotten
"Please Give proves that a film can be a spectacularly rewarding experience by just providing time spent with well-written, believable adult characters.",Fresh
It recognizes that a film about unpleasant people need not be unpleasant itself as long as it remembers not to make them uninteresting as well.,Fresh
"As she has in four previous films, Holofcener smartly relies on Keener's talent to create a layered character who is neurotic and often inappropriate, but still good at her core.",Fresh
"Far from challenging, the film consoles the complacent, saying basically that you can do whatever you want, so long as you feel (or pretend to feel) a little guilty about it.",Rotten
"Holofcener has sprinkled in quite a lot of humor, without which the film may have been too overbearing. But it's not, and we enjoy the characters, partly because, in this 90 minute effort, they don't wear out their welcome.",Fresh
"Yet another ramble through the tiny world of the affluent and the idle, a particular fascination of Holofcener's. The only difference this time is the increased emphasis on morbidity.",Rotten
"While Holofcener's scenes are profoundly accurate and wildly amusing, they hit home like a sledge hammer to those of us who share these feelings.",Fresh
The combination of good-nature and light snark [make] Please Give maybe the strongest film of Holofcener's career.,Fresh
"There's nothing wrong with asking audiences to make up their own minds, but Please Give doesn't even ask.",Rotten
Some filmmakers make movies that hold up a mirror to nature. Nicole Holofcener makes seriocomedies that hold up a magnifying glass to human nature.,Fresh
The film's premise yields a story that's insightful and engaging while touching on many other matters of love and money.,Fresh
The characters and their varying viewpoints on the haves and have-nots are entertaining and thought-provoking.,Fresh
There's no movie around right now with a subject more pertinent. It'll hit you hard.,Fresh
Please Give is one of those movies that can be enjoyed simply for its funny portraits of human foibles and fumbling grasps at intimacy -- but it's also deceivingly profound.,Fresh
"It's a movie about guilt and family and what we mean when we say something is valuable, all of which are great subjects.",Fresh
A funny and pointed take of class anxieties from the Woody Allen school,Fresh
"Nobody loves messy, human imperfections quite like writer-director Nicole Holofcener.",Fresh
"There are laughs and moments of pain and many instances of embarrassing (and deeply human) behavior throughout, but there's also delicacy and grace...",Fresh
"Nicole Holofcener is frequently lauded for writing vivid female characters, but such praise doesn't really do justice to her full game.",Fresh
"Touching, intelligent and full of charm and wit.",Fresh
"Please Give is an almost perfectly rendered slice of life, buoyant with wonderful performances.",Fresh
"While the characters contend with their precarious self-images, we can't help but reflect on ourselves as well. To borrow a cautionary phrase about that mirror: 'Objects may appear closer than they are.'",Fresh
A tremendous leap forward for filmmaker Nicole Holofcener...,Fresh
"[The script is] sharp and witty, but never forced, and features some of the best pure dialogue you'll hear this year.",Fresh
"In Please Give, Keener is at her best. Let's hope her creative partnership with Holofcener continues.",Fresh
"While Please Give is a film about conscience, it's also slyly funny, with piercing moments of insight and warmth.",Fresh
"In a Holofcener film, the usual rules of screenwriting do not apply, which lends her work a lifelike quality that's particularly refreshing in this era of formulaic remakes and sequels.",Fresh
"Give thrives because of these professional efforts, which help to mold something strangely poignant and thrillingly neurotic out of a plot that should rightfully be nothing more than a cinematic air horn.",Fresh
"Happily, the joy outweighs the guilt.",Fresh
"Exploring class, generations and misbehaving bodies, Holofcener's dramedy refines its character studies with warmth and wit as she creates warts-and-all individuals whose flawed humanity we warm to.",Fresh
"An indie with real pedigree and smarts, Holofcener's comedy of manners is well-observered and well worth watching.",Fresh
"Maybe things get worse, but movies like this at least make it easier to handle.",Fresh
"There's the rare occasion where the boldness of the dialogue is laid on a little thick and it drags you out of the moment, but it doesn't happen often, and the odd excess is more than forgiveable given just how well the rest of the film works.",Fresh
"Trifles, trivialities, frippery and froth. We've got plenty of words to describe things that don't matter. And now, we also have a film. Please Give.",Rotten
"Beautifully played and sharply-written, the pleasures on offer here are apparently throwaway but the authenticity of the characters freights the story with a light-hearted realism.",Fresh
"Holofcener's biggest ally against nauseating self-pity is Keener, her screen alter ego.",Fresh
"Smart and touching, this is a must for lovers of human drama.",Fresh
Keener manages to flesh out her character more deeply than the sometimes stage-rash behavior Holofcener demands.,Fresh
Starved for whip-smart dialogue and characters who don't behave as though they've just stepped out of a cartoon? Holofcener's latest is guaranteed to please. Give it a look.,Fresh
"Enjoyable, emotionally engaging comedy-drama from writer-director Nicole Holofcener, featuring a sharply written script, likeable characters and terrific performances from a talented ensemble cast.",Fresh
"Funny yet emotional, tragic yet full of hope, this is the type of character-driven story theatergoers could use to see more of, and as like as Holofcener is around here's hope more is exactly what it is we are going to get.",Fresh
"Comes close to justifying the praise it has received -- close, but not entirely.",Fresh
"Holofcener allows her strong ensemble room to really explore their characters. Keener and Hall are the obvious standouts, but fresh-faced Sarah Steele is particularly good in support, as Kate's teenage daughter.",Fresh
"Nothing earth-shaking goes on here, and Holofcener has the good sense not to make her issues seem all that important. This is a lightweight comedy about mostly likable people who are a bit too wrapped up in self-analysis.",Fresh
"Three dimensional characters, direct no nonsense dialogue and a dry sense of humour combine to create an understated thoroughly enjoyable feel-good film that leaves viewers with an invisible glow.",Fresh
Here's a sentence I've typed before: Rebecca Hall is the best thing about this movie. The British actress raises the level of every production she touches.,Fresh
Director/writer Nicole Holofcener goes back east for Please Give. It is an auspicious move.,Fresh
"Compare these wonderfully flawed, beautifully insecure and wholly believable characters with the preprogrammed mannequins seen in such chowderheaded efforts as, say, The Back-Up Plan or Killers, and the contrast is startling.",Fresh
Real joys and sorrows must be bigger and deeper than this.,Rotten
"It ends with this exchange: 'Thank You.' 'You're welcome.' How often do those simple words carry weight in a movie? At that moment, I loved those characters, and I loved this movie.",Fresh
an Upper East Side slice of navel gazing,Rotten
"Nicole Holofcener's lovely Please Give is a small, modest movie, full of the sort of characters we might know, or be.",Fresh
"If you're hoping for huge dramatic payoff or more than mild laughs from cynically satisfying script, then you're panhandling without a Styrofoam cup.",Fresh
This plot less movie lacks any momentum and you get no feeling of empathy or sympathy for any of the characters. The ensemble acting is sound with Guilbert standing out with a nostalgic trip down memory lane for viewers.,Fresh
Ms. Holofcener's observant talky comedy resonates with plenty of oomph as a believable modern-day fable about urban life.,Fresh
Nicole Holofcener creates open-ended characters whose ordinary lives are so fascinating that when the credits roll you're wondering why Transformers gets a sequel and not them.,Fresh
"In both Please Give and Friends with Money, she wrestles with our all-to-human desire for nice things but judiciously avoids ridiculing her characters for sharing a longing that is as universal as it is regrettable.",Fresh
"As Holofcener charts the telling little developments in these randomly connected lives the film offers wry smiles, smart repartee, mild whimsy and some plaintive, poignant moments.",Fresh
"A spiky, sophisticated, grown-up comedy...",Fresh
"Touching: that's what makes Holofcener's films so lovely. They are beady-eyed satires, sure, but they're also fundamentally kind-hearted.",Fresh
"This is a small film, which, if you're open to it, will draw you into the lives of people you quickly forget are fictional.",Fresh
"It sparks laughter by crossing the wires of human motivation, letting you see the hazards that exist in trying to be a good person.",Fresh
"Writer-director Holofcener cleverly keeps the emotions gurgling right under the surface of this engaging interpersonal comedy. It's more about smiles than laughing out loud, but the superior cast members get terrific characters to play with.",Fresh
"A well-written, well-acted dramatic comedy that is light on plot but generous in spirit.",Fresh
"It is well-observed but morally stunted, in that it suggests that charity is just another form of self-medication",Rotten
"Holofcener writes, and helps to shape on-screen, characters we often don't even like, and what do we do? We invite them home with us. Talk about a soft touch.",Fresh
A stroll with these characters is a refreshing break from from the usual film exercises.,Fresh
"Please Give is quintessential Holofcener -- a loopy, episodic ensemble story of women dealing with marriage, money and men, but it's also her smartest, most disciplined movie to date.",Fresh
"Keener, one of the most reliably entertaining actresses currently working, specializes in sardonic, flawed characters -- a perfect fit for Holofcener's image of the modern American woman.",Fresh
"Writer-director Nicole Holofcener seems to get better with every film, and now she's cruising along the well-trodden path of neurotic New Yorker comedy-drama with grace and comely confidence.",Fresh
"Life-goes-on movies usually don't electrify the senses, but this one stimulates moral imagination.",Fresh
"Keener has become Holofcener's artistic alter ego. In Please Give, the sharp-eyed filmmaker sends her vibrant representative out into the world to explore what it means for a woman to be lucky and still feel itchy.",Fresh
"Nicole Holofcener, who writes the most interesting female characters in the movies, delivers another dazzling role to her muse, Catherine Keener, in Please Give, a delightfully dry dramedy about guilt.",Fresh
"The acting quality is strong, especially from the ever-reliable Catherine Keener as Kate, but it's almost impossible to care about her character's dilemmas.",Rotten
Wryly humane,Fresh
"The film lives at that uneasy intersection between affluence and compassion, where the well-meaning well-to-do try to figure out how much of their wealth they need to give away to make a difference.",Fresh
"It's involving and often gripping with wonderful performances by a top cast, although the sum of its parts is less than the story as a whole",Fresh
"The main problem with the film, though, is that it seems to assume that self-obsessed and charmless people are automatically interesting - just for being people. There's definitely a flaw in that logic.",Rotten
"Please Give isn't laugh-out-loud funny, it is witty and clever-a pleasing tale where not much happens, but spending time with the film's characters is enough.",Fresh
"Holofcener takes pretty much everything you're not supposed to talk about at a dinner party and spins it into a ruefully awkward, bone-dry comedy.",Fresh
"The film is more emotionally incisive than it initially appears to be, but equally it ties together a little too neatly when it already has such a concise running time.",Rotten
"Keener never lets us lose sight of something possibly redeemable about Kate, a move which ultimately saves her performance from lapsing into an easy social caricature.",Fresh
Its conclusions are thoughtful and non-judgmental; satisfying even if it pulls a few punches.,Fresh
"Doesn't have much plot, just characters interacting and developing, and its lack of a need for drama is refreshing.",Fresh
"You have to be smart and funny and really aware of yourself to write and direct a film like this, which is exactly what director Nicole Holofcener is.",Fresh
"Funny at times, Please Give is a surprisingly heartwarming coming-of-age film for six adults all passing through different stages of heir life.",Fresh
"In another director's hands, this subject might have been rife with sanctimony. Instead, Holofcener has made a sly, urbane comedy with several smart actresses who make her acerbic dialogue lively and believable, character-driven.",Fresh
"In writer/director Nicole Holofcener's crisp, poignant and funny new movie, Kipling's ""white man's burden"" has evolved into the liberal woman's guilt.",Fresh
"The most underrated American director this side of Richard Linklater, Nicole Holofcener, continues to be a master of The Moment: a tiny but meaningful exchange or look or gesture that conveys more emotion than any awards-bait monologue could.",Fresh
"Holofcener brings a knowing empathy to all her characters, even the cruel cosmetician played by Peet. But she seems to have found a screen surrogate in Keener...",Fresh
Please Give is truly a film for our age; it's darkly comic stuff from a mistress of the miserable-urbanites genre.,Fresh
"About the people who give, the people who don't give and how we finally manage to connect with one another.",Fresh
"10 (1979) is known for its numerical rating system for beautiful women. It described itself as ""a temptingly tasteful comedy for adults",Fresh
Obvious but entertaining portrayal of midlife crisis gone horribly awry.,Fresh
Highly over-rated Dudley Moore comedy.,Rotten
"And oh, the irony, that the film only deserves a '1.'",Rotten
It was a big hit. I have never understood why.,Rotten
"Sexist, juvenile, and pathetically structured, despite the gamest efforts of its actors and the blithe willingness of its famous non-actor.",Rotten
"""10"" explores sexual yearning in a drama that is both funny and right on target with its depiction of the yearnings of men.",Fresh
People tend to forget what a hilarious movie this really is,Fresh
"Blake Edwards's 10 is perhaps the first comedy about terminal yearning. Like all great comedies, it deals with emotions very close to our hearts.",Fresh
"A sporadically funny, marginally interesting fiasco that might have evolved into a memorable romantic comedy.",Rotten
"This passable but not great Blake Edwards picture became known for the huge impact that the beautiful Bo Derek had on hairstyle; Bo's stardom was shortlived, though.",Fresh
"Dudley Moore is periodically funny, Julie Andrews is mostly charming, and Bo Derek is always gorgeous.",Fresh
"10's tossed-off quality keeps it from greatness, but it also distinguishes it from the great mass of contemporary comedies smoothed to a shiny, edgeless formula. [Blu-ray]",Fresh
"A fascinating character study, bittersweet and insightful yet full of tremendous laughs.",Fresh
It has some gags - some are even quite funny - but not nearly enough.,Rotten
"A film with texture, humour and relevance at all times. All in 91 minutes.",Fresh
"In a time of bloated when special effects have become the real stars, going back to a classic like this can remind viewers what movie making is supposed to be about -- acting.",Fresh
Completely deserved its high status of undisputed classic.,Fresh
"Thoroughly engaging, there is nothing dated or corny in Reginald Rose's intensely knowing screenplay and Lumet's energetic direction.",Fresh
"While the composition of juries might change over time, the issues and attitudes that are explored here are timeless, as is this classic film.",Fresh
Cinema heresy that worked.,Fresh
"12 Angry Men (1957) is the gripping, penetrating, and engrossing examination of a diverse group of twelve jurors - all male, mostly middle-aged, white, and",Fresh
"12 Angry Men ranks as the tautest courtroom drama you'll ever see, surpassing Lumet's very good 1982 drama, The Verdict.",Fresh
Pure dynamite in movie form.,Fresh
"This is a film where tension comes from personality conflict, dialogue and body language, not action.",Fresh
Sidney Lumet's debut feels a bit stagy but is never short on tension.,Fresh
"An intense concentration of power, and my all-time favourite film.",Fresh
"Although it may sound ungallant, these 12 Angry Men, are all right without distaff glamour. Their dramas are powerful and provocative enough to keep a viewer spellbound.",Fresh
One-room dramas don't get much better than this,Fresh
"Ainda que se passe em um nico ambiente, esta obra-prima possui um alcance emocional imensurvel - e  incrvel que tenha sido o primeiro longa-metragem de Lumet.",Fresh
This film is a great combination of an adult theme and the treatment suitable for younger audience.,Fresh
A masterful work of debate and dialogue; of shifting momentum and the ideal of sticking to your scruples in the face of antagonistic groupthink.,Fresh
"Sidney Lumet's Oscar-nominated feature directing debut is a brilliant courtroom drama, featuring a superlative cast that includes Henry Fonda (also producer), Martin Balsam, Ed Begley, Jack Warden, and E.G. Marshall.",Fresh
A strangely realistic thriller.,Fresh
"Mechanically written, but within its own middlebrow limitations, it delivers the goods.",Fresh
"Makes no self-saluting motions to greater importance, which gives the material the much-desired breathing room it needs to reach full potency.",Fresh
Power house jury room drama w/cast of memorable actors.,Fresh
Every bit the classic it's been made out to be for all these years.,Fresh
The film leaves a tremendous impact.,Fresh
"Not much action, lots of words, great cinema.",Fresh
"taut, well-crafted sociological study",Fresh
"12 Angry Men has some shrewd observations to sell about argumentation and group behavior, but they're not the ones of which the film seems most proud.",Fresh
A brilliant courtroom drama whose strength lies within the power of Rose's words and Sidney Lumet's great direction (his debut).,Fresh
Outstanding Henry Fonda jury classic.,Fresh
"Lumet keeps things tense, sweaty, suspenseful and entertaining despite the contrived story line.",Fresh
an incisive and gripping film,Fresh
"This was Sidney Lumet's first movie and it's as riveting as it was back in the late 50s, when everything was changing.",Fresh
"The cast is incredible, the writing superb, and the film is unparalleled in its sheer excellence.",Fresh
"The film takes a confined, almost completely banal real-world location and makes it completely dynamic, using incredibly nimble camera movements to establish character motivation and theme.",Fresh
"Too few films take on the art of arguing as a subject; we could certainly use more of them, but until then, Lumet's window into strained civic duty will continue to serve mightily.",Fresh
"There is real value is how it allows each member of the cultural mosaic of a jury to develop into distinct, damaged, and interesting characters",Fresh
...the film has aged surprisingly well in the years since its 1957 release.,Fresh
"Lumet in his first film records it as a meticulous laboratory experiment, a clammy orchestra",Fresh
With each new viewing I come away feelings as if I have peeled away another layer on the characters and their buried motives.,Fresh
"In the 60 years since its release, Sidney Lumet's masterpiece has lost none of its impact. In this age of unreason, 12 Angry Men remains sorely and urgently contemporary.",Fresh
This movie is a masterpiece. That term gets thrown around a lot -- it's a very easy thing to say about great films like this -- but this movie is one of the best. This is one of the very few films that I will call perfect.,Fresh
One of Hollywood's more notable borrowings from television is this Reginald Rose drama about the soul-searchings of a murder-trial jury...,Fresh
"""12 Angry Men"" puts the full range of human good and evil on display. It posits that, ultimately, the universe is benevolent, and our job, regarding each other, is to attempt with our best effort and greatest compassion to elucidate and clarify the truth.",Fresh
"Thought-provoking, continually riveting, and absolutely unforgettable - and surprisingly designed around a very simple, tightly budgeted, special-effects-free premise.",Fresh
Reginald Rose's script is one of deep revelation.,Fresh
[The] embodiment of Disney at his best -- family entertainment that superbly uses brand-new wonders of film technology.,Fresh
"Thrill-freighted are the underwater action sequences, topped by a tensely exciting battle with a giant squid...",Fresh
One of Disney's finest live-action family-flick adventures.,Fresh
better than the ride at Disney!,Fresh
One of the all-time great fantasy-adventure films.,Fresh
"Squid battle aside, though, 20,000 Leagues doesn't give us much more pioneering footage, and that doesn't take place until the very end. The rest of the film -- in retrospect -- is just waiting for the finale.",Rotten
"The talky 20,000 Leagues probably won't thrill kids fresh from The Matrix, but they may be interested to know that the Verne film was the effects marvel of its day.",Fresh
...a vision of beauty and excitement for the eye and ear. It's still fun to watch after all these years.,Fresh
"20,000 Leagues is a sublime story of isolation, of disparate masculine seclusion, akin to those found in such films as Jaws and The Thing.",Fresh
"As fabulous and fantastic as anything he has ever done in cartoons is Walt Disney's 'live action' movie made from Jules Verne's 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea.",Fresh
"This is one of the great movie adventures, fully deserving its canonisation in Disney World.",Fresh
"This is one of Disney's best, and one of the all-time adventure greats. And that, I swear by my tattoo.",Fresh
"Walt Disney's production of 20000 Leagues under the Sea is very special kind of picture, combining photographic ingenuity, imaginative story telling and fiscal daring.",Fresh
One of the best Disney live action films and a classic fantasy-adventure.,Fresh
Grandly entertaining.,Fresh
"Far superior to the majority of genre efforts from the period (or any period, for that matter), with production design and technical effects that have dated hardly at all.",Fresh
"A breathtaking piece of entertainment, 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea is amongst the finest live-action films to come out of Disney Studios.",Fresh
"James Mason's portrayal of Captain Nemo is a hard-edged, dramatic performance, with no winking nods or cartoonish layers. You could transport Mason whole into a much darker movie with R-rated violence, and he would fit like a glove.",Fresh
A classic action-adventure for older kids.,Fresh
Bring on the David Fincher-helmed remake.,Rotten
A good one that could have been better with a little less Kirk Douglas and more scientific things to gawk at in wonder.,Fresh
"The mammoths, the savage, beaked jungle beasts and the giant sabre tooth tiger all make splendid appearances. The spectacular landscapes of desert, mountain, river and jungle also deliver the images we are expecting. It's the humans who let us down.",Rotten
A tedious bore in which grubby people stand around muttering in a variety of badly chosen accents.,Rotten
"Emmerich's epic is a formulaic mishmash of a movie, visually sweeping but silly blend of actioner, adventure, man vs. nature, man vs. animal -- above all, a reminder of how superior Mel Gibson's Apocalypto was.",Rotten
... a dull compendium of recycled adventure epic cliches.,Rotten
Roland Emmerich has a remarkable talent for draining all the life out of interesting stories.,Rotten
"The film's heart is in the right place, but its script is not evolved enough to deliver the message without the constant clout of a caveman's club.",Rotten
The kind of movie that people will discover new and hilarious ways to mock for years to come.,Rotten
I have to give Emmerich credit for creating a film that's been funnier than '27 Dresses' or 'Over Her Dead Body.',Rotten
"CGI effects are letter perfect believable. The opening mastodon hunt/stampede is as good as effects seen in the recent 'King Kong,' greatly enhancing the film.",Fresh
about as slow and lumbering as a wounded manuk.,Rotten
"Emmerich has never been one to rely on the wizardry of nuance, but I was stunned to feel numb to nearly everything B.C. offered, as if my mind immediately detected a filmmaker looking to brazenly cash in on his past successes.",Rotten
"In an age where ... audiences reward blood-and-thunder films ... at the box office, greenlighting 10,000 B.C. must have seemed logical. I can imagine someone pitching the film ...by saying ""It's like 300 .... + 9,700!""",Rotten
"Roland Emmerich is partial to cutting-edge special effects and stone-age storytelling, meaning that 10,000 B.C., a dim-witted CG extravaganza set in prehistoric times, is something like his ideal project.",Rotten
An atrocious waste of a perfectly good CGI budget ... at least the Geico commercials make an effort to get the historical accuracy right,Rotten
The little-prehistoric-epic-that-could actually delivers an entertaining couple of hours.,Fresh
"It's best not to think too hard about anything in 10,000 BC, a sublimely dunderheaded excursion into human prehistory.",Rotten
"While the movie is completely ridiculous, at least it's fun to think of all the high school students who are going to mistake this movie for an accurate historical record and get F's on their next pop quiz.",Rotten
"Emmerich knows how to fill the screen with spectacle, but not how to field-marshal it.",Rotten
"Digital imagery imagines a striking prehistoric world for these back-to-basics heroes, villains and raging beasts.",Fresh
"An epic adventure of such towering testosterone counts and ceaseless tedium, you can almost feel the hair growing on your chest as the bags collect beneath your eyes.",Rotten
"Rather than taking the trouble to imagine what early civilization might have been like -- its culture, its language, its warfare, its family life -- the movie simply transposes a banal Hollywood epic into Paleolithic times.",Rotten
"Almost worth sitting through the first half for the revelatory moment when you're forced to ask yourself: Is nearly the entire cast suddenly being attacked by what look like cracked-out ostriches? Why, yes, yes they are.",Rotten
"Worst of all, no one even gets eaten by the disappointingly tame saber-toothed tiger.",Rotten
"A mix of vast CGI spectacle and small, silly moments, the prehistoric saga 10,000 BC is an epic in name only.",Rotten
"Conventional where it should be bold and mild where it should be wild, 10,000 BC reps a missed opportunity to present an imaginative vision of a prehistoric moment.",Rotten
"Sometimes you have a hankering for a slab of 10,000-year-old cheese. Here it is, on a cracker.",Fresh
"May indeed last until the end of time, kept alive in drinking games and in history and geography classrooms on April Fool's Day.",Rotten
A lovely-to-look-at but ultimately forgettable adventure flick that feels like a cross between Land of the Pharaohs and the greatest hits of Joseph Campbell.,Rotten
This crackpot combination of Pathfinder and Apocalypto [is] a brainless exercise in prehistoric goofiness that actually affords more laughs than Ice Age.,Rotten
"I can't figure out exactly when the film 10,000 B.C. is set, but it's definitely ancient times. Like before they had cars, guns or tabloid blogs. And definitely before they had cohesive plots or dialogue that made sense.",Rotten
"While there's an attempt to make this a personal story, it's really about what we thought it would be: Incredible vistas populated with a combination of ancient temples, pyramids, woolly mammoths and a cast of (CGI) thousands.",Rotten
I cheered for the villains who were building a colossal civilization.,Rotten
The sheer spectacle of the film makes it an easier sell on the big screen than on DVD,Rotten
"Too dumb to take seriously, but just silly enough to be sort of fun.",Fresh
"One part Joseph Campbell hero quest, one part multi-culti morality tale, one part live-action Flintstones cartoon, 10,000 B.C. is finally every part just plain nuts.",Rotten
"This much-delayed film cries out for consideration for Worst CGI, Most Annoying Narrator, Lamest Dialogue and Dumbest Action Hero.",Rotten
Even a cameo by Pauly Shore in Encino Man would liven up this bombastic bore.,Rotten
"10,000 B.C. is a movie of woolly mammoths and fuzzy thinking.",Rotten
"10,000 BC would be much better if it allowed itself the freedom to be kitsch.",Rotten
"The best acting comes from woolly mammoths, man-eating ostriches and a saber-toothed tiger -- and those babies are digital. It's the human actors who look fake.",Rotten
"10,000 B.C. isn't only brain-dead, it's completely dead. It's inert and without a heartbeat.",Rotten
Where's Raquel Welch in that fur bikini?,Rotten
Yabba-dabba-don't.,Rotten
"While the special effects are top notch... the humans are dull, the dialogue is ridiculous, and anyone expecting a repeat of the action in 300 is going to be sorely disappointed with this bloodless PG-13 adventure.",Rotten
"...the Yagahl speak English with an inflection that ranges from fake-African to fake-Russian, sometimes within the same sentence.",Rotten
"The less said about historical accuracy, the better.",Rotten
"The characters may speak English, but the narrative is gibberish.",Rotten
"Outrageous and outlandish, Emmerich's 10,000 BC is easy to mock, but it is so cheerfully shameless and terminally silly that you have to admire its effrontery and accept its creator... as a certified crackpot visionary.",Fresh
"Hey, CG mammoths! And lots of 'em! And some raptor/dodo thingies that move exactly like Spielberg's dinosaurs. Still, looks cool enough. Could've used some more of the saber-toothed tiger, though.",Rotten
A strong camp sensibility is just about the only thing that might have saved this lumbering beast.,Rotten
"10,000 B.C. is a true disaster on every level, a derivative and sometimes incomprehensible mess.",Rotten
"The mammoths are cool. The squealing killer ostriches, perhaps inspired by ancient phorusrhacid fossils, are idiotic but... okay, they're idiotic.",Rotten
"If you thought 300 was silly, think of 10,000 BC as 33.333 times sillier.",Rotten
Barney Rubble had a lot more charisma than anyone involved in this movie.,Rotten
"You may be expecting a showcase of cutting-edge visuals -- isn't the appeal of the title the implicit promise of seeing a lost world re-created to presumably dazzling effect? But for the most part, it's just barren landscapes and people in animal skins.",Rotten
It made me yearn to see Caveman again. At least that was intentionally funny.,Rotten
Overblown and stupefyingly dull.,Rotten
"[I] saith to you that I had a strangely good time, and whether that is from laughing at 10,000 B.C. or laughing with it I knoweth not, although I strongly suspect the former.",Rotten
"There have been funny movies about prehistoric times ... but for real gut-busting laughs, it's hard to top the ridiculousness of 10,000 B.C.",Rotten
"Even as a fantasy spectacle, 10,000 B.C. is sorely in need of intelligent design.",Rotten
"There's shockingly nothing to recommend about this flat, dull, and excruciatingly boring adventure to a time that apparently predates things like character, action, or even editing.",Rotten
"Oh my god: the silly, it burns. It burns!",Rotten
"Clearly, the B.C. here stands for Benetton Colors, since it's got nothing to do real history.",Rotten
"Too much of 10,000 BC seems to be sampled from other movies that preceded it",Rotten
"It promises spectacle and action but fails to deliver all that much of either, and ends up being so dull it can't even be enjoyed for its camp value.",Rotten
"More than anything else, though, the movie recalls the overblown Hollywood biblical epics of the 1950s, with all their attendant anachronisms and free-floating cheese.",Rotten
"Our favorite Teutonic huckster presumes that prehistory means that anything narrative goes: hey, who can prove him wrong?",Rotten
"10,000 B.C. takes a prehistoric approach to storytelling.",Rotten
"This may well be the first prehistoric epic in which the liberal deployment of such words as ""oog,"" ""agh"" and ""uck"" would have actually improved the screenplay considerably.",Rotten
"As a series of set pieces looking for any available fable to keep it afloat, 10,000 BC is really nothing more than computing power and implausibility.",Rotten
Director Roland Emmerich is the ultimate spectacle over substance filmmaker. He actually makes Michael Bay look like Stanley Kubrick by comparison.,Rotten
"If you are ten years old fan of video games with a short attention span and no knowledge of history, you will love this movie. The further you stray from these core qualifications, the less you will love it.",Rotten
"...it's laughably bad, which means that if you can approach it as a really stupid film you just might find yourself enjoying it.",Rotten
The film proves to be uncharacteristically restrained.,Rotten
Would that Emmerich took as much care with his human characters as with inanimate objects and CGI animals.,Rotten
"This is just stupidly lazy storytelling, nothing more (and certainly nothing less), and I'd tell the director to be ashamed of himself but I'm pretty darn positive he didn't even notice he did anything wrong.",Rotten
"While admittedly formulaic and banal, it's also a guilty pleasure for those who enjoy watching stampeding herds of woolly mammoths.",Rotten
"10,000 B.C. is a load of crap dressed up with pretty background vistas. The film is terminally lifeless, something that a so-called 'event' picture should never be.",Rotten
"On a Neanderthal level, ""10,000 B.C."" works.",Rotten
One of the stupidest and most boring films of the year.,Rotten
"Visually, historically and creatively, this film dishonors the year 10,000 B.C.",Rotten
This is actually a movie you forget while watching it.,Rotten
"'A sweeping odyssey into a mythical age of prophesies and gods,' according to the press notes; it's also a sweeping odyssey into a mythical age in which snow is referred to even by Ice Age veterans as 'the great white rain'...",Rotten
"While there are moments, '10,000 B.C.' never makes you jump. On the + side, the movie isn't as lumbering as those digital elephantine beasts.",Rotten
"Making prehistoric people talk and behave just like modern people in a 10,000 B.C. setting makes actors look silly. Their costumes are silly, the settings are silly, and the whole movie is unintentionally funny.",Rotten
"My poor brain hung in there for as long as it could, but it lost its grip during the giant chicken attack and I haven't seen it since.",Rotten
"If Mel Gibson remade Apocalypto and cast it with the Geico cavemen, he might end up with something akin to 10,000 B.C..",Rotten
Just barely good enough to fulfill the needs of an audience starved for any sort of effects-driven film that hardly sticks in the brain for more than a few minutes after it's over.,Rotten
"Good special effects are expensive, so the filmmakers are forced to use unimpressive actors to fill in the spaces between the CGI creations.",Rotten
...lovesick prehistoric man traverses the globe to rescue the woman he loves.,Rotten
"It's all just F/X opportunities, exposing Hollywood's -- and our own -- non-relationship to history.",Rotten
"Neither grand enough to be impressive nor antic enough to be charming, the movie settles for bland and frantic, climaxing in a showdown among decadent pyramid builders.",Rotten
Sets new standards for stupidity. This is like Uwe Boll with a budget. This is the village idiot of movies.,Rotten
This year's first Event Movie is almost guaranteed to wind up as its dumbest.,Rotten
"Strait has to be one of the most unsympathetic cardboard heroes of the genre, while Bell leaves little reason to care for her beyond her bitching dreadlocks...",Rotten
"Director Roland Emmerich has swapped disaster movies like The Day After Tomorrow and Godzilla for, well, a disaster of a movie.",Rotten
"Even though there's never a hint of either research or gritty realism, it's still good fun.",Rotten
"Roland Emmerich's prehistoric odyssey 10,000 BC is his silliest, most preposterous blockbuster to date. But it's lots of fun, too.",Fresh
Roland Emmerich's great big CGI blockbuster lumbers along like one of the woolly mammoths that roam across the screen.,Rotten
"Don't expect Roland Emmerich's 10,000BC to make much sense, historically, geographically or logically.",Rotten
"In what might be a record, the makers of this prehistoric drama spent two years and 20m fine-tuning the special effects to ensure its cast of mammoths, sabre-toothed tigers and maneating birds looked as realistic as possible.",Rotten
Should have been a lot more fun.,Rotten
"Roland Emmerich loves to make big, dumb movies, and though this may not be his biggest, it's certainly his dumbest.",Rotten
Take the kids along; unless you want them to grow up to be palaeontologists.,Fresh
"A beggar's banquet of milky CGI beasties and clunky battle-porn set-pieces, 10,000 B.C. is an extravagant waste of time, money and effort. Fans of caveman antics may want to go with something more historically accurate. Like The Flintstones.",Rotten
"Like the lumbering mammoths, it is plodding and dull.",Rotten
"With too much talk, not enough adventure and a laughable disregard for geography and anthropology, 10,000 BC is less Jurassic Park than Pleistocene parp.",Rotten
"The mammoths aren't all that is wild and woolly in this innocent, old-fashioned, amusingly self-important, entertainingly mad, rip-snorting throwback to vintage Saturday matinee fare.",Fresh
"One can only infer that, in order for it to be taken seriously, the makers expected audiences to forget pretty much every movie they'd ever seen before in their entire life.",Rotten
"strictly a popcorn flick version of Joseph Campell's hero's journey that looks great even as it plays fast and very loose with geography, biology, and anything else that gets in its way",Fresh
"A blind man is brought up on a slab from beneath the earth, where he has spent years cooped up in cramped quarters with nothing to keep him entertained. After spending two hours in a darkened theater watching 10,000 B.C., I could relate.",Rotten
"With a dreadfully dull story and performances as petrified as 12,000-year-old wooden artifacts, 10,000 BC shambles along as if on a march to its own extinction.",Rotten
It's a horrible movie.,Rotten
"I don't know about you, but if I want to get excited about an ancient mammal I'll tune in Janice Dickinson.",Rotten
"You actually have to feel sorry for the actors, one of which is New Zealander Cliff Curtis, the only person I recognised.",Rotten
Surely it's only coincidence that the sign of D'Leh's accomplishment is a White Spear.,Rotten
"It's just a wrong movie altogether, an elaborately nonsensical stew of crazy costumes, bizarre accessories, and funny voices.",Rotten
"it is hard to be enthralled with the dusty, warmed-over romantic fixations of what is essentially a very handsome cave-couple",Rotten
"I enjoyed the movie, so it qualifies as a mammoth guilty pleasure",Fresh
It's a film that countryman Uwe Boll would have made had he the budget and the cinematographer,Rotten
The actors speak in fluent anachronistic English. The dialogue is prehistoric but not in the way Emmerich intended.,Rotten
"crap, and more crap in a crap bucket",Rotten
One of the worst movies I've ever seen.,Rotten
"ena matso kakomoirides sernontai stin ammo kai ton ilio, s' ena ftino, proheiro, afeles kai kakogoysto deigma karampinatis gerontikis anoias toy Emmerich",Rotten
The filmmakers should be ashamed of themselves for even allowing this movie to enter a movie theatre. It was like a bad made for TV special that you would see on ABC or NBC.,Rotten
"In fact, while sitting through this banal attempt at a big-scale epic, I could not help but go through a checklist in my mind of all the movies ""10,000 B.C."" borrows from.",Rotten
It was a pleasant surprise.,Fresh
"But the folks who made 10,000 B.C. have filled their film with a sub-Disney plot and inserted a few measly slivers of action that hardly warrant all the mystical hubbub and romantic angst.",Rotten
"Ready to rumble, scantily clad Neanderthals gone wild, gliding around the globe faster than high speed Internet. And while dodging seemingly nearsighted menacing reptiles with bad manners, whose oversized choppers repeatedly miss their mark.",Rotten
...most of the film is simply a matter of waiting for it to end.,Rotten
A disaster that can't even get the computer generated images right.,Rotten
"I can't help but think that 10,000 BC started out as an idea that sounded like, ""Wouldn't it be cool if we had wooly mammoths and saber toothed tigers and people all in the same movie?"" and went from there.",Rotten
"Would make a good drinking game; silly fun but not ""good."" A critic sitting near me snorted in derision at my ""the costumes kicked ass,"" but I won't back down. They were really cool.",Rotten
"People expecting a fun action movie will be severely disappointed. If you get drunk with some buddies and go to make fun of it, you might like it more. But that doesn't make it a good movie",Rotten
Brace yourself for a mammoth disappointment.,Rotten
"10,000 BC takes film making back to the stone age...",Rotten
"Heavy on moronic mysticism and light on imagination, excitement, and shot-to-shot coherence",Rotten
"Violent, poorly conceived prehistoric action.",Rotten
"Some backgrounds look as though Roland Emmerich and crew broke into a museum after hours and filmed in dioramas. Rather than a disaster film, this was just plain disaster - a departure from Emmerich's usually effective milieu and his most moronic movie.",Rotten
One of the biggest problems with the film is the casting.,Rotten
"All [Emmerich] cares about is not being boring. On that level, he succeeds.",Rotten
"A lousier adventure movie you won't find this year: 10,000 B.C. belongs, if not back in the stone age, then at least back in the mid '90s, where this sort of mindless, effects-driven drivel is best left.",Rotten
It is inconceivable that filmmakers as experienced as Emmerich and his team didn't know they were making a bad movie.,Rotten
A prehistoric train wreck.,Rotten
"Nothing more than a standard boy meets girl, boy loses girl, and boy becomes a man to save the girl, with the Geico cavemen thrown in.",Rotten
A remarkably beautiful yet soulless film.,Rotten
"If you haven't seen it, do.",Fresh
Laced with comic romantic touches.,Fresh
"For those who love a grand spy mystery, a wild chase, and a harrowing portrait of an innocent man struggling to prove his innocence while the world turns inexplicably against him, The 39 Steps is ideal.",Fresh
If you can imagine Anatole France writing a detective story you will have some notion of the artistry that Hitchcock brings to this screen version of John Buchan's novel.,Fresh
"The 39 Steps (1935) is one of the earlier Alfred Hitchcock British spy-chase suspense-thrillers from a vintage period, his 18th film. Considered his first real masterpiece, it is both a crowd-pleasing box-office success and an extremely influential film",Fresh
It's almost cleansing to see a film like this which doesn't insult your intelligence.,Fresh
"The ""innocent man"" notion has been copied and recopied for decades, but few have the minerals to stand with this one.",Fresh
A brilliant piece of pure -- and purely enjoyable -- filmmaking.,Fresh
"As dull as anything Hitchcock has done, save the exhilerating final 10 minutes.",Rotten
"Wonderful early sound, quite British Hitchcock thriller",Fresh
"O excesso de coincidncias leva o roteiro a soar maniquesta (bem como a ""tenso sexual"" entre Donat e Carroll), mas a direo de Hitchcock, como sempre, salva o filme.",Fresh
Brilliant early Hitch,Fresh
Great fun.,Fresh
"As an artist, Alfred Hitchcock surpassed this early achievement many times in his career, but for sheer entertainment value it still stands in the forefront of his work.",Fresh
"This film couldn't be more entertaining, even if it had 40 steps.",Fresh
"With its great turns by Donat, Carroll (the original Hitchcock blonde) and all the cast, and immaculate direction of a cracking script, this is timelessly enjoyable. A true classic.",Fresh
"All the fun of North By Northwest in a little over half the time, The 39 Steps is -- even for the umpteenth viewing -- absolutely unmissable.",Fresh
Hitchcock at his very best.,Fresh
"It's melodrama and at times far-fetched and improbable, but the story twists and spins artfully from one high-powered sequence to another while the entertainment holds like steel cable from start to finish.",Fresh
"In Hitchcock's hands, however, this well-known espionage adventure provided the basis for a new sort of thriller and a new sort of comedy.",Fresh
Far more substance than other thrillers.,Fresh
"Holding up extremely well, 39 Steps, Hitchcock's most commercial UK film, mixes successfuly suspense, comedy, and romance, serving as format for many later pictures (especially North by Northwest).",Fresh
"The 39 Steps was the first time everything just came together: the master's favorite themes, his sense of humor, his timing and rhythm, and his personal touch. With this movie, he emerged, fully formed.",Fresh
"an indelibly fun movie, one of Hitchcock's early triumphs of sheer enjoyment",Fresh
"The 39 Steps is sexy, exciting, unexpectedly moving (thanks to Peggy Ashcroft's portrayal of a lonely woman married to a brutish farmer), and wholly unpredictable, with an ending that nicely loops back to the start.",Fresh
"Classic Hitchcock suspense, some drinking and smoking.",Fresh
At its most breathtaking when both Hitchcock and his characters fully embrace the surreality of the story,Fresh
"Surprisingly fast-paced for a 1935 film, full of twists and turns, and when the unlikely couple becomes handcuffed together and are forced to pretend they are married, it really kicks into high gear. Donat and Carroll have chemistry to burn.",Fresh
The Thirty-Nine Steps neatly converts its essential implausihility into an asset by stressing the difficulties which confront its hero when he tries to tell outsiders about the predicament he is in.,Fresh
Alfred Hitchcock brings John Buchan's novel to the screen with characteristic wit and verve.,Fresh
"The scene in which Mr Memory is asked at the London Palladium ""What are the 39 Steps?"" remains one of 20th-century cinema's most gripping moments.",Fresh
The atmosphere of adventure and mystery created at once in the opening sequence in an East End music hall is excellently maintained throughout.,Fresh
The 39 Steps is a masterclass in propulsive narrative cinema that even today's so-called blockbuster auteurs should study.,Fresh
The lack of chemistry between Donat and Carroll's respective characters only compounds the hands-off feel...,Rotten
"The 39 Steps is light, urbane, sexy as hell, and as so much of Hitchcock was so often, right about everything.",Fresh
"The newest Gaumont British importation, The 39 Steps, should prove pretty conclusively that Alfred Hitchcock is the finest native director in England.",Fresh
The 39 Steps is as polite as Geneva and as wicked as a dozen G-men pictures in one.,Fresh
It's a gripping entertainment.,Fresh
"Made in England 1935, 'The 39 Steps' isn't the first Hitchcock film constructed around ""the wrong man"" conceit, but it's one where he found his touch.",Fresh
"The 39 Steps transcends the time period: part Bond movie, part comedic caper, and anchored by a performance that feels Ryan Goslingian, it's a black-and-white movie that feels alive and contemporary.",Fresh
"A noteworthy example of Hitchcock's early thrillers, riddled with plotting, backstabbing, clever twists, and the big reveal of the meaning behind the title.",Fresh
"Despite an abundance of talk, this 1957 film is often considered [Daves'] best.",Fresh
"Fine Daves, Ford collaborative western",Fresh
It's rather talky but always remains lively and tense.,Fresh
A taut Western (obviously inspired by High Noon) about a lone man bravely standing on principle when all others have abandoned him. Marred only by a phony ending.,Fresh
"It's of necessity a talkative film, with Ford working on Heflin's nerves in a stream of Machiavellian banter, but one held in perfect balance by Daves, who keeps the tension strung taut.",Fresh
This is a first-rate action picture -- a respectable second section to High Noon.,Fresh
The enjoyment here that outweighs the film's derivativeness comes in the dialogue and relationship developed between outlaw and rancher.,Fresh
"Made in the vein of The Gunfighter and High Noon, this mature psychological Western is arguably Delmer Daves best film, featuring Van Heflin (in the Gary Cooper role) and Glenn Ford as the bad-good guy at their most appealing and accomplished.",Fresh
"That the climax fizzles must be laid on doorstep of Halsted Welles, who adapts Elmore Leonard's story quite well until that point.",Rotten
"During the 1950s, the Western grew a conscience.",Fresh
An enjoyable western that's an excellent reminder of how - in the world of movies - sometimes less is best.,Fresh
"Though masterful in stretches, it ultimately mistakes feel-good qualities for truly satisfying ones.",Fresh
The new 3:10 to Yuma will have to be quite a film to stand up to the original.,Fresh
A sturdy genre piece.,Fresh
"The minutes tick toward 3:10, and all we can do is watch and hope that it all turns out ok. That's the best kind of Western, one that allows feelings like that to emerge while watching.",Fresh
No amount of climactic train smoke can mask the fact that the finale is fancifully optimistic gibberish.,Fresh
"Although not as nerve-wracking as High Noon, 3:10 to Yuma is even more claustrophobic‚Ä¶ and the two-character drama is more intriguing than High Noon's protagonist standing alone.",Fresh
The film is something of a classic and boasts a terrific ending.,Fresh
"A portrait of storytelling made for and by the Silent Generation, an audience all too familiar with the world's spooky, white-knuckled moral twilight.",Fresh
"Daves isn't interested in cynicism. Redemption is probably too big a stretch as well, but there's plenty of room in-between.",Fresh
"Distinguished by its thoughtfulness regarding the nature of Western heroism, as defined not only by dead-eye gunplay, but by family, community, and moral rectitude. [Criterion Blu-ray]",Fresh
"Like The Gunfighter and Winchester '73, 3:10 to Yuma is one of those defining '50s Westerns that is well-known by film buffs but has never reached the familiarity level of a High Noon or Shane.",Fresh
The compositions evoke a kind of open-air claustrophobia ...,Fresh
It is hard to imagine a better Ben Wade than Glenn Ford.,Fresh
"Mind games replace gunplay to the point that, while the film's running time doesn't outstay its welcome, those expecting a nonstop shootout extravaganza may leave unsatisfied.",Fresh
The romance between the leads isn't as compelling or as believable as it should be.,Rotten
Charly comes off as emotionally manipulative and sadly imitative of innumerable past Love Story derisions.,Rotten
"Imagine the CleanFlicks version of 'Love Story,' with Ali MacGraw's profanities replaced by romance-novel platitudes.",Rotten
"'Charly' will divide its audience in two separate groups, those reaching for more tissues and those begging for mercy...",Fresh
"It is a likable story, told with competence.",Fresh
"Beers, who, when she's given the right lines, can charm the paint off the wall ... [but] the script goes wrong at several key junctures.",Rotten
The movie is too amateurishly square to make the most of its own ironic implications.,Rotten
"The film is old-fashioned, occasionally charming and as subtle as boldface.",Rotten
"If religious films aren't your bailiwick, stay away. Otherwise, this could be a passable date film.",Rotten
A competent but self-righteous film that offers little insight into love or faith.,Rotten
An archaic biopic.,Fresh
Recommended solely for Walter Huston's performance.,Fresh
Abraham Lincoln is a startlingly superlative accomplishment.,Fresh
"Sympathetic, sophisticated and, for those with a keen eye, echoed in the work of Hitchcock and Welles.",Fresh
"Working with the sort of mythic material later associated with John Ford, Griffith gives us a primordial Lincoln, perfectly incarnated by Walter Huston, and a dreamlike sense of destiny that his camera fully articulates.",Fresh
It is quite a worthy pictorial offering with a genuinely fine and inspiring performance by Walter Huston in the role of the martyred President.,Fresh
"Brilliant flashes of direction permeate the entire film, and it remains distinctively a product of the great master.",Fresh
"D. W. Griffith's first sound film, from 1930, is as ungainly and majestic as its subject.",Fresh
"It feels mostly like an antique, but even antiques have their own particular beauties.",Fresh
"Feels like a relic, a sad, weak swan song from one of cinema's most legendary filmmakers.",Rotten
"The fact that it draws tears is rather against it than for it. The pathos of a tremendous social occurrence should not be refined or lachrymose, but revealing. The social occurrence seldom gets a chance here.",Rotten
"...while Dark Water isn't a complete wash (no pun intended), watched side-by-side with Ringu, it ultimately comes off as a pale successor.",Fresh
The picture is melancholy remembrance and its sources of fear are intimate and brilliant.,Fresh
"A horror movie that sits there and drags and seems very full of itself, and is based on the premise that puddles are scary. They're not.",Rotten
"just beneath its surface horror this film conceals a deep reservoir of tragedy, addressing themes like family breakdown, isolation, abandonment, and - something of a taboo in Japan - the terrible legacy of mental illness.",Fresh
"With extremely heavy echoes of his own 1998 film Ringu, Nakata is on subtle creep-out form here rather than big horror movie mode.",Fresh
"To date, the scariest movie I've ever seen.",Fresh
"Um terror bem construdo que no quer apenas provocar sustos passageiros, mas sim estabelecer um clima de tenso constante e personagens com os quais realmente nos importemos.",Fresh
So much of Dark Water is contrived that it defies the mind to try to make sense of it.,Rotten
"He [Nakata] wants us to absorb, to feel a location, and to understand the plight of the characters before he goes any further.",Fresh
"Benefits from having an undercurrent of sadness, which makes it feel quite similar to the ghost stories in Kwaidan.",Fresh
About as frightening as a soggy diaper.,Rotten
"It's flawed, but you should see Dark Water, a decent little chiller that brings a whole new meaning to rising damp.",Fresh
Its cleverness relies on transferring our concern from the supernatural events emanating from one lost child to the natural fear of a mother losing her own child to the other world.,Fresh
The Accused demonstrates that rape victims often are suspects in their own cases.,Fresh
Enough of a social commentary to make it worthwhile,Fresh
"has a slightly torrid made-for-TV feel to it ..., but is elevated by the superb performances and genuinely empathetic stance its takes",Fresh
A sobering and seriously well-acted tale of rape and retribution.,Fresh
"...the movie's certainly worth seeing, if only for Foster's award winning performance.",Fresh
Powerful rape drama.,Fresh
Provides a searing account of a gang rape through the story of two women who speak out against this violent crime,Fresh
"A atua√ß√£o intensa e corajosa de Jodie Foster quase redime um filme que, gra√ßas √† dire√ß√£o burocr√°tica de Kaplan, parece ter sido realizado para a televis√£o.",Fresh
"In her first Oscar role, Jodie Foster's gang-raped waitress transforms from a good-time hard-drinking girl to a woman fighting for the self-esteem she never had.",Fresh
"Possibly the best performance Foster has even given, and the best of its type",Fresh
"This performance didn't just win an Oscar. It won the hearts of every woman who has ever had to endure the horror of assault and the continued injustice of having to fight against prejudice and a legal system steeped in patriarchy, to be heard.",Fresh
"Kelly McGillis can make little of her underwritten role; economy is commend-able, but a woman in all her complexity cannot be represented by a pair of outsize shoulder-pads.",Rotten
"It compares very favorably with movies like The Good Mother, in which bad girls/sexual women make their bed, of nails, and are then told they better bloody well lie in it.",Fresh
"Despite the strong emotional connection many Miamians will feel toward the movie, The Lost City falls far short of the sweep, complexity and passion it strives for.",Rotten
"Somewhere inside this overlong, sometimes engaging, often tedious affair, there may be a solid, 100-minute movie.",Rotten
Garcia's overindulgence is punishing but I didn't come to the theatre to be soaked in soap opera sentiment.,Rotten
"Garcia offers the film to the Cuban community as something we should all be happy to see, but his esteem does not excuse the film's aesthetic mediocrity, cultural ignorance, and colossal self-absorption.",Rotten
"Staged with credibility and loads of Cubano flair, the film slows to a sludgy crawl, giving us lots of time to consider it as a pro-old-guard, anti- revolutionary elegy.",Rotten
Andy Garcia takes his time showing putting a plague on both the houses of Batista and Castro.,Fresh
"... it's too long, politically confusing and painfully self-indulgent, loaded with too many tertiary characters and darting from one subplot to the next like a butterfly with hiccups.",Rotten
"Compelling in fits and starts, actor-director Andy Garcia's The Lost City possesses grand aspirations but troublesome execution.",Rotten
"A lot goes wrong in this overlong movie, but it has a human touch.",Fresh
"...even trying to put [politics] aside, The Lost City has a number of problems.",Rotten
"Garcia's aching nostalgia for the glittering Havana of his dreams is palpable, but he winds up painting by the same 'doomed romance against a backdrop of revolution' numbers as piffle like Dirty Dancing: Havana Nights.",Rotten
... a lost movie that seems like it takes 16 years to end.,Rotten
"How the movie's politics will sit with the audience aside, one of the problems in this overlong melodrama is the distracting casting of Bill Murray as a wisecracking sidekick and Dustin Hoffman as mobster Meyer Lansky.",Rotten
"The sprawling -- two hours, 23 minutes -- epic meanders in places and its mix of tones and templates do not always serve its narrative. But the movie comes from the heart, filled with a passion that carries it through its rougher patches.",Fresh
"Havana may remain, in many ways, a lost city, but it'll take more than this movie to find it.",Rotten
... the film seems like a mini-series edited to feature length without time for character development.,Rotten
"The Lost City manages to make Havana, Sydney Pollack's disastrous 1990 attempt at a Casablanca homage set against the Cuban revolution with Robert Redford, look good by comparison.",Rotten
... a haphazard jumble.,Rotten
"Noteworthy and well-intended, The Lost City isn't exactly a lost opportunity, just a sincerely limited one.",Rotten
... a romantic epic manque that swoons across the screen for nearly two and a half hours without saying much ...,Rotten
"Garcia, who fled the country with his family as a young boy, obviously has a fierce passion for this material, and he knows to his very soul.",Fresh
"As a director, Garcia is such a sucker for gratuitous crosscutting and glossily elliptical filmmaking that viewers can be forgiven for mistaking Lost City for a 143-minute montage sequence.",Rotten
This is a very sad and winsome film.,Fresh
Handsomely executed but hopelessly flawed.,Rotten
"Throbbing with music, seething with anger and romance, The Lost City is a film that breaks your heart, bewilders, alienates and ravishes you by turns.",Fresh
"The Lost City has a subject, a setting and a historical backdrop, but in the foreground it has a relatively passive protagonist, Fico, whose passions are understated and whose fortunes inspire only minor concern.",Rotten
"Overdirected, yes, but it's an epic, passionate portrayal.",Fresh
"Feels like the distillation of countless conversations and family legends, rehearsed from time immemorial by Cubans who fled their homeland and sought to re-create it in their memories.",Fresh
It's the sort of epic that aspires to tell Cuba's modern political history and celebrate its people without introducing us to a single believable character.,Rotten
"Musical...handsome...poignantly nostalgic...The Lost City is a lot of things, but what it's not is incisive.",Rotten
"... full of characters with import more symbolic than dramatic (Bill Murray plays a veritable court jester), ideas that wander and contradictions that dissipate.",Rotten
"A tribute to pre-revolutionary Havana, an elegy on what was lost, a little payback for a regime that drove his family out and, best of all, a synthesis of the driving Afro-Cuban rhythms of the extraordinary music.",Fresh
"You can see why Garcia was drawn to this material, but he hasn't had much luck shaping it into a film.",Rotten
"As a musical fever dream of paradise lost, The Lost City is a flawed success, boasting just enough truth and admirable purpose to justify the hazards of Garcia's passion.",Fresh
"The film suggests a dutiful if clunky pastiche of The Godfather and a right-wing Reds, with Fellove and his brothers and parents representing a spectrum of possible responses to the Cuban revolution.",Rotten
"Though the filmmaker's feel for his Cuban heritage is bone-deep, it's a glazed and dolorous movie -- a depressed epic.",Rotten
"Lovely to look at, and its mixture of Cuban standards and Garcia originals is delightful to listen to.",Fresh
"The coming CD, not the DVD, should be the keeper.",Rotten
"Somewhere amid the bric-a-brac -- hot rhythms, ocean breezes and political upheaval and melodrama -- a movie languishes. Garcia never really finds it.",Rotten
"A pretty bauble, a trinket offered when the stakes of barter were life and death.",Rotten
"What makes this movie interesting is the family (and not just because it's made up of 3 beautiful brothers). It's a love story, between a man and a woman and between a people and their country.",Rotten
"While earnest in intent and visually elegant, simply too narratively amorphous and emotionally desiccated.",Rotten
"If you want to see a good, entertaining movie about Havana, circa 1958, better to rent Havana, than waste your money on this turkey.",Rotten
Listening to the soundtrack would likely provide a better artistic experience than watching this predictable plot play out.,Rotten
Garcia's fans and viewers who love Cuban music will probably enjoy The Lost City if they don't mind the long run time.,Fresh
"For a film rooted in the director's own experience, The Lost City is surprisingly unilluminating.",Rotten
"Our cue that Garcia is acting is when he furiously bats his eyes in his smoldering emotional scenes. Either that, or he's allergic to the smoke from all those Cuban cigars.",Rotten
"It's barely coherent as it is, but at 2 hours and 23 minutes, The Lost City is simply infuriating.",Rotten
"Too scattered, too confused, too patched-together to work dramatically.",Rotten
The movie has too many stories to tell and tells none of them very well.,Rotten
"Unfortunately, the broad scope leads to a tedious pace, as Garcia lacks the restraint to match his keen visual eye.",Rotten
"Turgid, lumpy and almost unwatchably dull.",Rotten
"It's a potent work, enlivened by fabulous Cuban music and Garcia's obvious love for his land and his culture.",Fresh
"Unfortunately, Garcia is inept as a director. His scenes are shapeless and bloated with self-important speeches.",Rotten
Unsteady but often entrancing.,Fresh
"Somehow simultaneously too much and not enough. At 143 minutes, it well overstays its welcome as a movie, but with a little more fleshing out it might have worked as a miniseries.",Rotten
"It's handsome and heartfelt but mired in murky politics, plot inertia, musical montages and painfully pointed symbolism.",Rotten
Garcia needed better guiding hands and eyes in the editing room to jettison the many parts that bog down the story.,Rotten
"... when it finds its footing, it becomes the movie it longs to be. And that happens often enough to make it worth finding, even when it seems as lost as the city it loves.",Fresh
"Even though the movie is made with an abundance of heart, it's sad to report that the final result has only a weak pulse.",Rotten
"Book-ended by fine songs; in between, Garcia offers more than two hours of clumsy Coppola/Scorsese karaoke...",Rotten
"For a tribute to a lost city, Garcia has made a lost film.",Rotten
"The result has a potluck rather than persuasive, integrated quality.",Rotten
"Shapeless stories that drift away from the revolution, puffed up by a biased take on 1959 Cuba with the hot air of romance.",Rotten
Garcia's storytelling lacks highs and lows and has far too much going on. And on.,Rotten
"While the soundtrack of Cuban dance music is superb, this historical drama is leaden and simply too long-winded for its own good.",Rotten
"...plays like a confusing and inferior Caribbean analog to The Godfather, without anything like the narrative drive of Coppola's film.",Rotten
"When it succeeds, the film conveys a bittersweet longing for a lost moment and the unfulfilled promise of a democratic Cuba.",Fresh
"It's by no means a flawless film, but it's a meaty one, and if you're a big fan of Andy Garcia, I'd definitely recommend it. (Plus, Bill Murray's in there.)",Fresh
Garcia is just too earnest to make his dream project anything but deadly dull.,Rotten
Garcia obviously has more ambition than skill.,Fresh
"Andy Garcia's directorial debut is a flawed and overlong but nonetheless watchable drama with strong performances, a superb soundtrack and bizarre appearances from Dustin Hoffman and Bill Murray.",Fresh
"'The Lost City' is intriguing as a historical document and adequate as cinema, but it has a blandness at its core that no amount of spicy mambo and booty-quaking dance routines can disguise.",Rotten
"There may be a good film here, but it struggles to break free of the cumbersome framework.",Rotten
"Andy Garcia's preposterous vanity project The Lost City is an all-singing, all-dancing version of the Cuban Revolution.",Rotten
"The script is scrupulously even-handed, but Garcia can't seem to get a grip on this sprawl.",Rotten
"Great music and costumes, but with a woeful plot and jaw-droppingly stilted dialogue. Cuban-born Garcia's main complaint against Fidel seems to be that rich, corrupt Cubans could no longer dance the night away.",Rotten
"Not an embarrassment, but definitely a missed opportunity.",Rotten
Unfolds like a series of as outtakes from Hollywood productions,Rotten
By the half way point I was beginning to take back everything I said re Steven Soderbergh's dull-as-ditchwater Che: Part II - even he manages to drum up more tension than this.,Rotten
Clearly the best movie adaptation of a Hemingway novel.,Fresh
"The Breaking Point adapts Hemingway's book and wrings out some genuine notes of solid tragedy, as well as a more nuanced performance from its lead actor.",Fresh
The insistence and courage of the film's final shot elevates it from a very good film to a nearly great one.,Fresh
"Harry may be tough, but in Curtiz' hands he's basically a nice guy in noirland.",Fresh
"The film is always interesting and often exciting, and Mr. Michael Curtiz has directed it in a tough and sullen style which is most effective.",Fresh
The Breaking Point is crackling good drama.,Fresh
"It emerges as a strong, sardonic melodrama, more honest than most in its close-ups of human relationships.",Fresh
"Phyllis Thaxter steals the show. Her scenes are the best in the movie, and some of the best domestic scenes in cinema history. You don't often see a husband and wife on equal footing like this, nor do you see it this sexually charged.",Fresh
"The acting, script and direction (by Michael Curtiz) are first-rate, making it classic filmmaking.",Fresh
"Arguably the superior mounting of the Ernest Hemingway story, The Breaking Point proves moral gloom exists as equally and virulently sunny-side up.",Fresh
"Adam's Rib gives us writers, performers and a director all operating at peak levels of performance; it's a classic comedy.",Fresh
"Adam's Rib (1949) is director George Cukor's most famous film of the battle of the sexes - between two married lawyers. The Oscar-nominated screenplay (originally titled Man and Wife) for the sparkling, MGM classic (screwball) comedy...",Fresh
"Enjoyable Tracy-Hepburn comedy. Maybe not great, but very good",Fresh
Of Adam's Rib we might say...that it isn't solid food but it certainly is meaty and juicy and comically nourishing.,Fresh
Really funny movie. I enjoyed this one!,Fresh
Classic stuff.,Fresh
"Sex Wars mid-century style. Adam's Rib can't help but look a bit dated, but it sure is a perfect encapsulation of a certain type of couple at a certain time.",Fresh
"A well-written and acted comedy that was ahead of its time in counterpointing some basic assumptions, that there are certain ""male"" and ""female"" qualities and that each gender can and must exchange these qualities as trading cards.",Fresh
The performances (not least from Wayne and Hagen) are matchless.,Fresh
"It lost some of its luster with time, but it's still amusing.",Fresh
An impeccably crafted and scripted classic.,Fresh
Irresistable comedy from one of Hollywood's greatest pairings.,Fresh
"Delightful, sophisticated comedy sparked by the famous chemistry between Katharine Hepburn and Spencer Tracy.",Fresh
"The film is a classic, and deservedly so: the conjunction of Tracy's sly listlessness and Hepburn's stridency defines 'chemistry' in the movies.",Fresh
George Cukor directs with a light touch and the film leaps from one priceless moment to the next,Fresh
"Adam's Rib is a bright comedy success, belting over a succession of sophisticated laughs.",Fresh
"Thanks to an at times sharp script, solid lead performances, and a scene stealing supporting turn by Judy Holliday, Adam's Rib is an entertaining enough film to warrant a solid review. But one of the great comedies of all time? Not even close.",Fresh
Katharine Hepburn conveys an extraordinary abundance of spirit.,Fresh
"Despite many improbabilities, this is a barbed and entertaining comedy thanks to some great casting and a very clever Kanin/Gordon script",Fresh
Adam's Rib is one of the smartest comedies in years. It is a welcome return to the sophisticated spoofing that Hollywood seemed to have forgotten.,Fresh
It feels as if it's more about how a couple can playfully fight while facing off in a courtroom rather than whether or not women should be treated impartially.,Rotten
Pedestrian...a high-minded snoozer studded with stars who all seem almost perversely miscast and directed in a grimly deliberate style designed to italicize every point.,Rotten
"Even though director-adaptor Mary McGuckian expended much creative energy trying to pump original spirit into the characters, she never brings any of them to life.",Rotten
None of the performances work.,Rotten
"Unlike the bridge, the movie unravels at a very slow pace.",Rotten
"The stellar cast can do little to paper over the cracks in an awkward, unevenly-paced script that is composed of a series of sometimes-attractive scenes with little emotional undertow.",Rotten
"Visually sumptuous but dramatically muddled and confusing, The Bridge of San Luis Rey ultimately comes across as a soporific costume drama featuring a gallery of miscast stars.",Rotten
"Whatever the intentions of novelist and filmmaker, having the audience root for the bridge probably wasn't one of them.",Rotten
"Though handsomely mounted, this parable of intersecting destinies and implacable tragedy is as lifeless as a wax tableau.",Rotten
The Bridge of San Luis Rey raises an important philosophical question: Is it better to fall to one's death from a rickety rope bridge overlooking a deep gorge or watch this miserable movie about several people sharing that awful fate?,Rotten
An endless powdered-wigs-and-feathered-pen slog.,Rotten
So dully written and executed that you'll be wishing the production had collapsed instead of the swaying bridge of San Luis Rey.,Rotten
The Viceroy states that they are 'surrounded by an ocean of boredom' - then you realize you're swimming in it.,Rotten
"How bad could a movie be that features talent as serious as Robert De Niro, Kathy Bates, Gabriel Byrne, Harvey Keitel, F. Murray Abraham and Geraldine Chaplin? That bad, alas.",Rotten
An honorable but dull attempt to translate a neglected literary source to the screen.,Rotten
"Audiences may wonder why a picture with Robert De Niro, Kathy Bates and Harvey Keitel would be so bereft of hype. After you've endured the film, all 120 airless minutes, you'll understand the rationale behind the quiet release.",Rotten
"As a director, McGuckian is overwhelmed by the immensity of her cast, and her misguided attempt to make a Hollywood epic on a European production budget.",Rotten
"It is an intense philosophical undertaking that examines questions of faith, fate and chance.",Fresh
Best characterized as an honourable folly.,Rotten
A wobbly Bridge. Impressive cast can't save terrible script.,Rotten
the worst film of the year... a fraud of the highest order,Rotten
leaves audience with the same unanswered question as the one asked by its narrator,Rotten
"How to turn an embarrassment of riches into an embarrassment, period.",Rotten
"Why do good actors pop up in bad movies? More perplexingly, why do so many good actors end up in the same bad movie?",Rotten
The Bridge of San Luis Rey is a beautiful movie. The film's shooting locations are exquisite. The sets are stunning. The costumes are gorgeous. The actors are superlative. Too bad the movie sucks.,Rotten
A neat noir thriller.,Fresh
A powerful thriller from Losey before he fell foul of Hollywood's infamous blacklist.,Fresh
Losey rises magnificently to the occasion in his use of the Mojave Desert ghost town location.,Fresh
"A bawdy, daring story.",Fresh
"Losey's script is fine, but doesn't really draw the audience in, or inspire compassion for any of the characters.",Fresh
"A scary, fascinating film.",Fresh
The Prowler may be the creepiest of classic noirs.,Fresh
"This hallucinatory film noir is still, for me, Joseph Losey's best film.",Fresh
a ferociously perverse noir masterpiece,Fresh
Director Losey and screenwriter Trumbo aren't providing the usual mystery tale here.,Fresh
"... a classic of working class envy, restless resentment... and the brutal opportunism of a former golden boy willing to do anything to get what he's sure is due him.",Fresh
A down and dirty masterpiece.,Fresh
The rectangle-within-a-rectangle symmetry of the window within the frame of the movie screen in the opening scene reinforces the notion that the filmgoer is essentially a licensed Peeping Tom...,Fresh
Losey's magnificently ruthless dismantling of his characters' veneers and delusions and self-made traps,Fresh
"The Prowler becomes a twisted vision of American entrepreneurship, with the two leads forming a grotesque nuclear family.",Fresh
"It's really a quick, deft analysis of a kind of world where corruption and easy answers are on the advance.",Fresh
The notion of a police stalker bending rules for the sake of controlling a situation and possessing a woman would continue to fuel mind-benders for decades to come.,Fresh
We got two and a half more months of crap to go before we get to the holiday/awards season.,Rotten
"Produced by Soderbergh, Criminal bears an uncanny resemblance to the master's films.",Rotten
"The movie was made just four years ago by Argentinian director Fabian Bielinsky. It is called Nine Queens, and it is vastly superior to this blah U.S. remake from director Gregory Jacobs.",Rotten
Criminal's biggest offense may be that Jacobs and his actors make absolutely no attempt to rewrite Nine Queens.,Rotten
[Full of] fine acting and sharp dialog.,Fresh
"By the end, those who haven't seen Nine Queens may applaud the entertaining sleight-of-hand...those who have may lament that Criminal is the proverbial old dog.",Fresh
"The result isn't as compelling as Nine Queens, but it's a respectable caper movie in the tradition of The Sting and David Mamet's Heist.",Fresh
"[D]amn if Criminal doesn't actually improve upon The Nine Queens, the Argentine film upon which it is very closely based.",Fresh
A classic crime caper that twists and turns with an easy subtly.,Fresh
Mines David Mamet territory in tone and dialogue but a good con like this is still highly entertaining.,Fresh
"If you missed the original, Criminal is a reasonable facsimile.",Fresh
an easy mark to make and a hard movie to sell to paying customers.,Rotten
A retread and it feels like it.,Rotten
The returns will be diminished for those too familiar with the story.,Fresh
"The cast comes off like a buncha cute, likable kids playing dress-up, which only intensifies the movie's pointless karaoke flavor.",Rotten
But... but... it's the same movie.,Fresh
"a quirky daylight noir with a plot that spins on a dime as its twists and turns on its way to proving that it's greed, not love, that doth make fools of us all",Fresh
"We know someone is pulling something, and someone is going to get away with something, and someone is going to be left holding the bag of cheese, but Jacobs keeps us on our toes.",Fresh
Manages to satisfy despite being inferior to the original on nearly every level.,Fresh
John C. Reilly stars as a gimlet-eyed con man in this clever and diverting adaptation of the Argentine thriller Nine Queens.,Fresh
"Inherently calculated and cold, so smugly satisfied with itself and its surprise final trick that it seems to be running its own con to convince us the script's house of cards is actually substantial, original and slick.",Rotten
A reminder of the genre's irresistible lure and what pleasures can be derived when it cares enough to do things right.,Fresh
"A light, speedy movie, as agreeably modest as a pop hit or a BLT.",Fresh
"Habitual duplicity and backstabbing create a stimulating, deceptively intricate plot maze in this sharp, shrewd, but not showy remake.",Fresh
"It's all done with sufficient style that, when we get there, the end no longer feels like the point.",Fresh
"The finest tribute I can lavish on this stateside remake of 2002's Argentinean export Nine Queens is that it took me a full hour to remember I had seen the original -- and reviewed it, no less.",Fresh
Criminal does what every good con-game movie should: It keeps you guessing.,Fresh
Criminal is the sort of movie David Mamet would love -- or make.,Fresh
"This remake of the Argentine hit is effective at times, and Gyllenhaal shows a new side of her talent, but the main impression is of first-rate performers doing second-rate work.",Rotten
"It's hip, witty and fun, and will remind you why movies are made in the first place.",Fresh
It's an auspicious debut for first-timer Gregory Jacobs.,Fresh
Fans of con-man capers will have no regrets after watching Criminal.,Fresh
"Jacobs doesn't add anything new to the genre, but his version of taking the concepts out for a walk is entertaining enough to mark time until Ocean's Twelve.",Fresh
"Caper-movie lightning in a bottle, Criminal grifts the audience in a spectacular way.",Fresh
"A strong cast and some nice surprises, but misses the sparkle of the original.",Fresh
"Although Criminal retains its source material's cleverness and intricate plotting, something seems to have been lost in the translation.",Rotten
"The performances are winning -- Gyllenhaal is particularly sharp as an aggrieved sibling, and there's mutual zing in her scenes with Reilly.",Fresh
An exercise where viewers are likely to ponder not 'How did the characters do it?' but 'Who cares?',Rotten
"May not be any great shakes as a cinematic puzzle, but it gives Reilly and Luna an opportunity to perform a thespian song-and-dance routine.",Fresh
"Cast against type, Reilly unequivocally demonstrates the range, versatility, and ability that made him such a hot prospect over the last decade.",Fresh
"...newbies looking for an easy-breezy Ocean's Eleven-and-a-Half should get a kick out of this frugally low-key, innocuous cover song of a caper.",Fresh
"It is near impossible to make a great movie about con artists, because of the very nature of the genre itself.",Fresh
Reilly and Luna make a chemically appealing screen team.,Fresh
"Jacobs -- who for many years was Soderbergh's assistant director -- keeps things moving at a sprightly pace, and cinematographer Chris Menges does a terrific job of capturing L.A. in all its mercurial glory.",Fresh
This is a chance for Reilly to strut his stuff -- so good he ought to be illegal -- in harmony or against the grain with a variety of terrific character actors.,Fresh
"The remake is infinitely more entertaining if you haven't seen Nine Queens -- the details are different, but the surprises are the same and something of the first film's underlying darkness has been lost in translation.",Fresh
"Maybe watching Reilly, Luna and Gyllenhaal is quite enough entertainment value for any movie.",Fresh
The problems lie not with the actors but with a glib approach that exposes the flaws of the original story.,Rotten
"The fast, forced plot, which moves up from street grifts to a big score involving rare currency, lives in the amusing and zippered byplay of Luna and Reilly, who achieve a sort of marriage du jour for criminal purposes.",Fresh
"It's a good film, suitably entertaining, but there's the nagging question of why everyone bothered.",Fresh
"In the end, coincidence undoes Criminal.",Rotten
Those unfamiliar with Fabian Bielinsky's 2002 film will delight to this delicious deviousness.,Fresh
"The constant shadow of doubt keeps the viewer from investing in the characters, because we suspect one or more of them isn't what they seem.",Rotten
"L.A. looks hip in its lemonade light, and the low-budget Ocean's Eleven attitude gives Criminal a certain down-and-out swing.",Fresh
"It instantly earns a place alongside Jim McBride's pointless American take on Godard's Breathless on Hollywood's long, long shelf of misguided remakes.",Rotten
"Entertaining and well acted, but redundant and a bit machinelike.",Fresh
"In a way, the whole movie is a con job -- offering an inferior copy of something that wasn't too wonderful to begin with, while pretending that it has something new and stylish to sell.",Rotten
"Doesn't exactly reinvigorate an overworked genre, but neither does it disgrace the format or the original movie.",Fresh
A breathless and dazzling caper that knocks your socks off.,Fresh
"It's such a pleasure being in the company of these actors as they work with character-rich material that if they burst into the audience and swindled us out of our wallets, we would gladly oblige.",Fresh
"It's a listless, dutiful affair -- a cover version played out of obligation, not inspiration.",Rotten
"Its spiral of deceptions within deceptions remains resolutely character-based until the outlandish end, which proves emotionally satisfying because it's based on what really drives people as much as too-clever plotting.",Fresh
An incredibly clever and superbly paced caper filled with scams within scams within scams.,Fresh
"Reilly plays it so dour and unappealing, and Gyllenhaal comes off like such a sourpuss it's hard to garner a rooting interest one way or another.",Rotten
The disparity between Richard and Rodrigo is too great and the impossible coincidences of the ending are too far-fetched.,Rotten
This is the kind of movie so full of coincidence and double crosses that you simply don't have the mental energy to go back and sort it all out at the end.,Rotten
"Some snappy dialogue, fine performances and lots of shady atmosphere give Criminal a tasty B-movie flavor.",Fresh
"What elevates Criminal into a delicious con in the league of Red Rock West, House of Games or Matchstick Men is John C. Reilly.",Fresh
"Follows the original fairly closely, and because I already knew the plot secrets, it couldn't work on me in its intended way. As the recycled characters, dialog and events turned up, there seemed to be an echo in the room.",Rotten
"Glances at family dynamics and class divisions benefit the genre mix, and the cast animates the lean script with a simmering brew of charm, smarm, ferocious greed and street smarts.",Fresh
Reilly sheds a career playing dupes and schlubs and gives his first full-tilt electric performance.,Fresh
Scores higher than most con artist movies by focusing more on the artists than the con.,Fresh
Criminal has a wonderful modern film noir feel punctuated with incredibly clever dialog...,Fresh
It has half the panache and none of the surprise for anyone who saw the original.,Rotten
"It's funny, fast-paced, and sharp - as entertaining in English as it was in Spanish.",Fresh
I have to give Nine Hearts the edge but Criminal is an honest remake of its source material.,Fresh
Discerning audiences won't be scammed with this one.,Fresh
This double-whammy re-make will keep you guessing until the end.,Fresh
"Jacobs has brought the barrio into noir, and that's no small achievement. If nothing else, it opens the door to a whole new galaxy of grift.",Fresh
This remake of 'Nine Queens' is just as absorbing for those who did not see the original.,Fresh
... unfolds like a David Mamet film ...,Fresh
The Argentinean film Nine Queens re-dealt in a by-the-numbers American version set in Los Angeles.,Rotten
Criminal can be praised and damned for its fidelity to the Argentinean masterpiece Nine Queens.,Rotten
"If subtitles are not your thing and you're in the mood to witness an elegant con job in the classic Mamet mold, then Criminal is the card to play.",Fresh
"A competent Americanization of the Argentinian film ""Nine Queens,"" with John C. Reilly seemingly enjoying his atypical leading role.",Fresh
"even when the emotional aspect of the story starts to work, it is ultimately undermined by a final twist",Rotten
Not smooth or seductive enough to coerce you into taking it at face value.,Rotten
Like dj vu all over again.,Rotten
"Maybe I'm dense, but the finale of Criminal left me not exactly sure what was won and what was lost or why I should care.",Rotten
"With dashes of black humour and pointed glimpses of the American class system, Criminal is a taut con-versus-con game whose deft artistry isn't fully revealed until the last few minutes.",Fresh
"A kind of who-done-what? puzzle. You'll probably enjoy it much more if you haven't seen the 2002 Argentine film, Nine Queens.",Fresh
"You can't go too far wrong on the performance front with John C. Reilly, Diego Luna or Maggie Gyllenhaal, but this one never really goes above average.",Rotten
"Itself something of a counterfeit, 'Criminal' loses coherence at each new plot twist, eventually becoming silly and contrived.",Rotten
Yet another inexplicable American remake that adds nothing new to the original.,Fresh
The remake is so faithful to the first film that some of the snap and crackle disappears if you know the plot. It's like watching The Sixth Sense for a second time.,Fresh
"A jazzy, offhandedly brilliant exercise in colorful mendacity and shell game shenanigans that benefits from the cool, authoritative occupational swagger of John C. Reilly.",Fresh
This is one of the best con movies I have seen as rare currency is used as the valuable commodity.,Fresh
"Like a smash-and-grab job, the movie gets in, springs the con and gets out quick - leaving the viewer to replay the twists on his or her own time.",Fresh
"While the twists at the end are a little more predictable here than in the first film, it's still an assured work, especially considering that it comes from a first-time director.",Fresh
Redundant.,Rotten
"It isn't quite as witty or gritty as Nine Queens, but if you didn't see that film, then see it now that it's in English.",Fresh
Well acted and intriguing...,Fresh
Reilly is perhaps the most amazing fusion of boy and man we have in American movies.,Fresh
... a fairly straightforward remake of the Argentine hit Nine Queens (2000),Rotten
"Considerando-se que o timo Nove Rainhas foi realizado h apenas alguns anos, esta refilmagem soa desnecessria, por mais interessante que seja seu roteiro.",Fresh
"it's Training Day for confidence tricksters, an exciting 24-hour tour of LA's underworld with a headache-inducing sting in its tail.",Fresh
"...the interaction of the movie's two leads, Reilly and Luna, is so good you might enjoy it for their performances alone.",Rotten
"[It's] a safer, watered-down, but still enjoyable redo.",Fresh
A second-generation photocopy of a David Mamet cryptogram.,Rotten
"Con film aficionados won't find the picture revolutionary, but even they should enjoy the structure, craftsmanship and a nice supporting performance by Maggie Gyllenhaal.",Fresh
Those viewers who watched NUEVE REINAS beforehand will be affected with increasingly unpleasant feeling of deja vu.,Rotten
"Like Richard Widmark, [John C. Reilly] is an excellent character actor who can convey both likeability and pathetical desperation simultaneously.",Fresh
This con man movie is best for older teens and up.,Fresh
A witless high-concept action film that's forgettable.,Rotten
"Filmmaker Gregory Jacobs, making his debut here, delivers an opening half hour that's perhaps not as compelling as it could (or should) have been...",Fresh
There's nothing stars John C. Reilly and Diego Luna can do to make you forget you're watching the same story.,Rotten
There's more than enough weird and wise material to keep you entertained -- especially if you're an animation buff or a Samuel Clemens aficionado.,Fresh
Dry humor and scary scenes abound in Twain overview.,Fresh
"Everything looks soft, squashy and sort of ugly.",Rotten
This is an imaginative work.,Fresh
Such a wonderfully entertaining and rather charming film.,Fresh
"A nice piece of work, but unfortunately it smacks of bandwagon-jumping following the success of such docs as Winged Migration.",Fresh
"...if you want to have a majestically scored, beautiful, often haunting look into an unknown world, and only have 90 minutes to spare, go see ""Deep Blue.""",Fresh
The filmmakers startlingly bring to life the beauty and balance of nature.,Fresh
"Taking us from God's-eye-views of the sparkling surface to the darkest depths, this ocean odyssey conveys a riveting sense of nature's infinite variety.",Fresh
"The big screen adds extra impact to inspiring images which capture all the brutality, camaraderie and absurdity of the ocean.",Fresh
"Practically every shot in Deep Blue offers some sort of remarkable, jaw-dropping sight.",Fresh
"Fish gotta swim, birds gotta fly: you'll see both, nicely choreographed.",Fresh
Mother Nature reveals herself not so much as an entity that needs to be preserved but an action director much fiercer than Michael Bay.,Rotten
"If you see Deep Blue in theaters, it will be hard to resist seeking out the entire eight-part miniseries.",Fresh
Those looking for a refresher course on the workings of the food chain should be in heaven. All others may yearn for a sushi break.,Rotten
"Numerous films have explored undersea life, but few as comprehensively and as consistently compelling as Deep Blue.",Fresh
[A] meditative yet urgent documentary.,Fresh
Wide-ranging documentary on the mysteries and marvels of the ocean and the creatures that reside there.,Fresh
Alternately mind-blowing and mind-numbing.,Rotten
"It's not always pretty, but it's a shining of example of nature at its most brutal and beautiful.",Fresh
The film keeps facts and figures to a minimum and lets the breathtaking images (underscored by George Fenton's sometimes bombastic score) carry the show.,Fresh
"Deep Blue is a beautiful movie, nicely scored and elegantly shot. But it's all about as thrilling as a good aquarium.",Rotten
It's about half an hour too long and Pierce Brosnan's sonorous narration threatens to lull us to sleep on those rocking waves.,Rotten
A beautiful but empty-headed documentary about the creatures that lurk in the sea.,Rotten
"It may not actually be comprehensive, but it feels like Deep Blue touches on all the points worth knowing, and more just for fun.",Fresh
...it reminded me very much of a lava lamp I had in college...,Rotten
"Deep Blue isn't as fortunate with screen dimensions, but it works, if only because it's hard to deny the vast beauty and mysteries that lie in our abyssal oceans.",Fresh
"These iridescent oddities are pure science fiction, and they gave the grade-schooler in me a good 'Whoa!'",Fresh
This is as good a visual treat as you and your kids can expect.,Fresh
"Even with consistently impressive camerawork, the movie still feels like the visual equivalent of elevator music -- with frolicking dolphins instead of Elton John ballads.",Rotten
"A better action movie than most of what you'll see this summer, and there are certainly more visceral thrills.",Fresh
"It goes on a little too long for mostly just pretty pictures, and you get more wonder than educational detail, but it's fascinating to look at.",Fresh
"Documentary about the ocean's panorama of life is full of beauty, awe, terror, wonder -- and jaw-dropping cinematography.",Fresh
"A trip reminding us that, while we continue to explore space, we have yet to fully penetrate the mysteries of our own planet.",Fresh
This majestic film has all the hallmarks of Beeb quality workmanship.,Fresh
"If nature films had genres, Deep Blue would be an action movie.",Fresh
Lacks the connecting thesis statement that separates an above-par nature documentary from just a really cool episode of Animal Planet.,Rotten
A sumptuous but occasionally soporific nature documentary.,Fresh
"Deep Blue, while as gorgeously photographed as other nature documentaries, is more grisly than most.",Fresh
"There's certainly enough to hold one's interest during Deep Blue, but you won't learn as much as you would through a single corridor of Chicago's Shedd Aquarium.",Rotten
British filmmakers Andy Byatt and Alstair Fothergill don't try to teach us much; they just ask us to look at pretty fish.,Rotten
You can safely await its appearance on the small screen in your home.,Rotten
"This is a nasty, nauseating, dispiriting movie and, to repeat, whatever you do, don't take the kids -- no matter what the G rating says.",Rotten
"A magnificent look at the teeming, wildly varied life in and around the ocean.",Fresh
Deep Blue is like the oceans: stunningly beautiful and packed with shocking violence.,Fresh
Absorbing.,Fresh
[E]xtraordinarily lush and fantastically adventurous...,Fresh
"Unfortunately, the film tries to say too much, and as a result ends up saying nothing. Also, this G-rated film contains scenes of animal attacks that are much too intense for young audiences.",Rotten
"Stunning images of undersea life, ... but the footage is pieced together haphazardly, sometimes repetitively.",Rotten
"we've been in an ocean-documentary glut of late, and Deep Blue just doesn't have much in it that we haven't seen a few times before",Rotten
Honestly: In how many movies can you see a polar bear attacking a bunch of whales?,Fresh
"The information you find inside may not be anything more than you haven't garnered from watching Animal Planet, but it is an extremely well made and well shot piece.",Fresh
Deep Blue could have lived its life on TV and felt more at home,Rotten

"An entertaining 100 minutes that's well worth the price of admission, even if it's flawed in several respects.",Fresh
"Movie pageantry at its best, done in the grand manner of silent spectacles, brimming over with the sort of primitive energy that drew people to the movies in the first place.",Fresh
"Its purity of heart and purpose make it sheer, infectious fun.",Fresh
"Sumptuous and highly energetic, The Adventures of Robin Hood is grand with a capital 'G' on every level.",Fresh
"It is exhilarating because the film is, of course, one of the all-time great adventures and one of the most thoroughly entertaining movies ever made.",Fresh
"Fast-paced and loose, this 120-minute production concentrates mostly on fun, energy and high spirits.",Fresh
"In these cynical days when swashbucklers cannot be presented without an ironic subtext, this great 1938 film exists in an eternal summer of bravery and romance.",Fresh
it's a 65-year-old classic that still holds its rank as a movie among movies,Fresh

Errol Flynn buckles his swashes in this classic historical adventure.,Fresh
Peerless action-adventure romp from the Golden Age of Hollywood.,Fresh
Movies like this are beyond criticism.,Fresh
"It is cinematic pageantry at its best, a highly imaginative telling of folklore in all the hues of Technicolor.",Fresh
"Michael Curtiz's adventure, one of the most enjoyable swashbuckling epics made, flaunting star Errol Flynn at his very best, deservedly won several Oscar Awards, including editing for Dawson and music score for Korngold.",Fresh

"A rousing, high-spirited family entertainment rightly regarded as one for the ages. [Blu-ray]",Fresh

"Staff battling and sword fighting choreography are quite amusing, with Flynn and Rathbone engaging in believable matches of lightning-fast fencing.",Fresh
"Man Hunt is a very tightly constructed, endlessly surprising, and expertly played bit of cat-and-mouse.",Fresh
a daring film that explicitly prefigures the surge of anti-Nazi cinema that was to come,Fresh
"has moments of ingenuity and, at times, reflects the prowess of its creator but it's also a testament to sheer talent",Fresh
Well crafted spy thriller.,Fresh
Fritz Lang's WWII spy drama about a British hunter who stalks Hitler is sharply written by ace scribe Dudley Nichols and well acted by Walter Pidgeon in the lead and George Sanders in the supporting role of the Nazi chief who pursues him.,Fresh
"Lang's vision of the ""unconscious assassins"" unleashed for war",Fresh
it seems to lose sight of the daring adventure aspect and swerves into a fluffy romance,Rotten
"In 'Man Hunt,' tracking shots are literally tracking shots: When Lang's camera glides, it's in pursuit of a quarry, as if it were participating in what the movie's hero refers to as 'a sporting stalk.'",Fresh
This farfetched thriller offers some well-crafted noir-like breathtaking chase sequences that are tense and absorbing.,Fresh
"If one sought proof that his pre-war and post-war work were both products of the same mind, one need look no further than his 1941 film Man Hunt.",Fresh
You shouldn't be at all surprised to find your knuckles gnawed down a joint or two by the time Mr. Lang arrives at his climax,Fresh

"There's great promise in Dead End, and a script that is often clever, combined with a carload of decent actors, really helps cover a multitude of flaws.",Fresh
A small film like Dead End sneaks in and manages to floor pretty much everyone that's seen it.,Fresh
There's just nothing here to like at all.,Rotten
A funny and rollickingly good movie about the challenges of keeping a band together on the road.,Fresh
The band's perfectly mediocre pop (written and laid down by real musicians) accompanies a story that's both dramatic and hilarious.,Fresh
"Director Russell is gifted with an eye for the extreme, but sometimes he gets ahead of himself, thinking that odd camera angles and crude delivery will save a threadbare plot.",Rotten
Whore isn't titillating enough to appeal to the raincoat crowd nor weighty enough to warrant serious appraisal.,Rotten
"The subjects can be amusing, chilling, or tragic -- but in the end, they offer few surprises.",Rotten
"Whore, directed by the Spanish filmmaker who uses the pseudonym Luna, is a tedious, not-at-all titillating exploitation film.",Rotten
"Is there anything remotely new left to be said about the world's oldest profession? Perhaps, but Spanish director Maria Lidon's glossy film, which sets sleekly staged interviews with European prostitutes within a fictional story, never finds the words.",Rotten
A shallow film.,Rotten
"With a bizarre coiffure that makes him look like the lead singer of an '80s New Wave band, Franco flares his nostrils and pouts -- his performance riddled with so many Anakin-ims you'll think he's auditioning for The Hayden Christensen Story.",Rotten
Two phoned-in performances do not a romance make.,Rotten
"screenwriter Dean Georgaris has cherry-picked his way through [the legend] unable to synthesize what he has chosen to use into anything close to the compelling, passionate, and achingly poetic tale that has come down to us.",Rotten
"He freezes his face and half-fills his eyes as lovelorn fighter Tristan; the very Madame Toussaud effigy of Andy Gibb in a tunic, he lets his leonine mane do the emoting.",Rotten
"Franco lays on mannered tics, like a slurred vocal delivery reminiscent of Benicio del Toro's mush-mouthed hood from The Usual Suspects.",Rotten
"A tough, thrilling melodrama.",Fresh
"It's a nice attempt to tell a classic love story with integrity, but the execution falters, leaving the true power of the romance lacking when the film needs it the most.",Rotten
"Part Gladiator, part Braveheart, part Romeo and Juliet, Tristan & Isolde is all boring.",Rotten
Tristan & Isolde is the first pleasant surprise of 2006...Kevin Reynolds is a pretty good director when he's not associated with Kevin Costner.,Fresh
"Misguided, miscast, a travesty.",Rotten
"Oh, their legend will survive. But this classic comics-style perfume commercial of a re-telling will not.",Rotten
This relationship lacks a critical ingredient: passion.,Rotten
"Franco's curly locks may make the target audience swoon, but his presence never allows the rest of us to completely sink into Tristan & Isolde.",Rotten
"When a war is going down, why are the king and his fiercest lieutenants taking a time-out to attend to the lovesick?",Rotten
"How strange it is to see a film that's supposed to be all about the burning passion and unquenchable exhilaration of true love, and yet is rather passionless and unexhilarating.",Rotten
"Bypasses the mythic tone of Richard Wagner's opera...without forsaking storybook romance. The inoffensive results get the job done, but sadly fail to excite.",Rotten
"Well, I just had this weird feeling that things weren't going to work out for them. But even though you can see it coming, this director Kevin Reynolds just makes the whole thing drag on and on and on and on.",Rotten
Everything is a little too overdone.,Rotten
"Tristan & Isolde is gorgeous to watch. The film's cinematography shines as a stunning example of setting, costumes, choreography and visual mood. And the story is entertaining, epic in scope but without an interminable length.",Fresh
"There is something undeniably pleasant about an entertainment like Tristan & Isolde that delivers exactly what it promises, no less, no more.",Fresh
"Though Reynolds' film tops two hours (which in a season of epics seems almost trim), he keeps the action brisk.",Fresh
"Tristan has its slightly silly moments, but rather like those fondly remembered epics of Hollywood past, its energy and entertainment value carry the day.",Fresh
"Tristan & Isolde maintains a veneer of dramatic gravitas, but you'll feel more romantic intensity from the teenage couples sitting in the theater than from the two leads.",Rotten
"Mindless, predictable and mildly entertaining.",Rotten
"At its core is a pair of lovers no contemporary audience could possibly care for, and at the periphery are characters that threaten to become interesting but never quite do.",Rotten
"Tristan and Isolde is the story on which William Shakespeare based Romeo and Juliet, and, judging from the movie, he's a heck of a rewrite man.",Rotten
"The knights and ladies don't look like escapees from a Prince Valiant comic strip, but like physical, vulnerable, survivors of the conflicts left behind by the Romans.",Fresh
"As for the storied passion at the center of this tale, it burns about as brightly as a matchstick in a rainstorm.",Rotten
It's just a pretty valentine with no real heart.,Rotten
...never quite attains the full weight and grandeur that its tragic love story demands. Yet the movie is nothing to scoff at.,Fresh
"A tepid, tinny modernist recasting of the epic romance...something like a WB Network twentysomething soap opera in medieval dress.",Rotten
"Tristan & Isolde does nothing to help further the cause of historic epics. In fact, it may even go down in flames faster than you can say ""Orlando Bloom was horribly miscast in Kingdom of Heaven.""",Rotten
"The film gives off the feeling of being incredibly bored with itself. The feeling, sadly, is contagious.",Rotten
The leaden pacing and the lack of compelling performances eventually make even the most hardened ren-fair geeks in the house tune out.,Rotten
"Even though the time period has been brilliantly captured, it's too long and lacks pace. Even so, against all odds, I liked it. Many in my audience seemed to have a different opinion, laughing at lines that did not invite laughter.",Fresh
This couple has endured for over 900 years; the least Tristan & Isolde can do is show us a reason why.,Rotten
The end result plays out like a George Lucas film without spaceships and lightsabers.,Rotten
A handsomely produced and sporadically rousing re-retelling of the ancient Celtic legend about star-crossed lovers.,Fresh
"Director Kevin Reynolds isn't so much inspired as determined to tell it with period accuracy, without bothering to be historically accurate.",Rotten
"The movie plods around, appears to pick up speed, but then falters. Worse, we never feel true sympathy for the lovers who are forced to risk all to meet in secret when fate and politics keep them apart.",Rotten
"While Tristan & Isolde, a competent but uninspired film version of the legendary medieval romance, will likely fade from theaters and memories quickly, Myles' lovely face and spirited performance should linger.",Fresh
We don't find a tale of transcendent passion but rather of two vain nitwits in a case of routine attraction.,Rotten
"Reynolds' film has an evocative, old-fashioned storybook look (as if designed by N.C. Wyeth or Aubrey Beardsley), and features strong performances.",Fresh
"Filmed in breathtaking locations in Western Ireland and the Czech Republic, Tristan & Isolde is a disappointingly passion-free romance.",Rotten
"[Director Reynolds] has a feel for the rough beauty of western England and the Irish coast, and he moves quickly, if not always coherently, through battles and cabals.",Fresh
"The story itself -- Tristan falls in love with Isolde first, only to see her married off as part of a cold-hearted peace treaty -- is merely dreary, full of overwrought villainy and thuggish jousting.",Rotten
"Trying to underplay things, the actors practically sleepwalk. When someone finally gets the chance to shout, 'Seize him!' he does so with as much gusto as the guy who says, 'WINS news time: 8:45.'",Rotten
It's that rare movie that had me wishing I was at the opera.,Rotten
"Tristan & Isolde is deadly serious, straightforward and surprisingly entertaining tragedy that reinforces much of what we think we know about the Dark Ages in Britain.",Fresh
Reynolds has again delivered a lavish adventure for audiences who like their entertainment earnest and their storytelling straightforward.,Fresh
This whole movie feels so wrong that you're likely to develop a headache from all the eye rolling.,Rotten
"It's all nicely shot, but Tristan And Isolde lacks the soul that has kept this story alive for a thousand-+ years.",Fresh
There's far more smiting than smooching -- more hewing of limbs than heaving of bosoms.,Rotten
"Sorry, no magic here.",Rotten
"Tristan & Isolde strives to be the good old-fashioned medieval kind of romance that stirs the soul. But due to the somewhat lackluster performances from the doomed young lovers, the film doesn't quite hit the mark.",Rotten
Don't get out your handkerchiefs. You won't need them for Tristan & Isolde ... a fatal flaw in a movie that purports to recount the original star-crossed-lovers myth.,Rotten
"In the end, Tristan & Isolde is never painful. It's just a bit of a dull blade.",Rotten
This Tristan is strictly for those who prefer their romantic melodrama bloodied up a bit.,Rotten
"Unlike the opera, this version of the tale features no mystical elements and comes off as horribly contrived. What's more, director Kevin Reynolds' sluggish pacing makes the film feels twice as long as it really is.",Rotten
Franco looks appropriately troubled as Tristan. Myles is pretty and sweet enough to win hearts as Isolde.,Fresh
"They are hollow people mooning their way through a backdrop of endless battles in which wild-haired, wild-eyed men chop each other about.",Rotten
"The fate of two nations hinges on the nondisclosure of the stolen kisses and secret trysts. But, boy, could I have not cared less.",Rotten
"Music appreciation students might buy a ticket... expecting a film version of Wagner's popular opera. Sadly, the only sort of opera they'll be seeing is the kind proceeded by the word 'soap.'",Rotten
"Not as antic or silly as his Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves, Kevin Reynolds' return to the realm of noble knights, ardent damsels, and grim scoundrels is melodramatic and anachronistic.",Rotten
"No, Tristan & Isolde goes nowhere, does nothing and only succeeds at making an audience want for a more that never comes.",Rotten
... a hard film to watch unless you bring your own pre-existing fascination with the material.,Rotten
Suffers from a contemporary take on a very period piece.,Rotten
"Tristan & Isolde wants to be an epic, but it has all the weight of a high school play.",Rotten
"The longer the film ran, the more I wanted to be put out of Tristan and Isolde's misery.",Rotten
"Rather than complementing and intensifying the love story, a parallel tale of raging medieval war only interrupts the action. Alas, our love for this movie is one that can never be.",Rotten
"[""Tristan & Isolde""] is trying to be both chick flick and machismo movie. I'm not sure it does either well enough but it is a showcase for Sophia Myles.",Fresh
"There are serious ideas at work here. But in these hands, it's as shallow and glossed-over as Franco's English accent.",Rotten
"Formulaic, often tedious re-telling of the ancient legend.",Rotten
"one of those rare cinematic experiences that feels whole, that feels authentic.",Fresh
"A sweeping, heartfelt tale, beautifully told, that works on multiple levels.",Fresh
"In short, it's just not fun with the specter of tragedy looming over every scene.",Rotten
"Across the board, it's far from special.",Rotten
"I can wholeheartedly recommend Tristan & Isolde, even to those who don't have a penchant for period piece romances. The movie has a lot to offer.",Fresh
Yes! it's a story of love at first sight which will ring down the ages. But everyone seems bored with the whole nonsense.,Rotten
Stolen moments from other films abound but director Kevin Reynolds has clearly given the story and characters a life and identity of their own.,Fresh
The movie lacks style and pacing; Franco and Myles look too contemporary. They would be more at home with their romantic problems on some Fox or WB drama ...,Rotten
"Intensely romantic and artistically photographed, 'Tristan & Isolde' is a welcome quality release during the January movie doldrums.",Fresh
"Arthur Reinhart's stunning images repeatedly isolate Isolde among the cool, gray expanse of natural settings. She's a freethinking woman at the mercy of powerful forces beyond her control, trapped in the wrong place at the wrong time in history.",Fresh
I dub thee tolerable.,Fresh
"[R]eally good, in all sorts of unexpected ways: it's stirring, sexy, exciting, tragic, and perhaps most surprisingly, genuine.",Fresh
"A serious, old-fashioned, history-heavy romance.",Fresh
"Do we really want less magic in our legends? And if these stories are stripped of their mythic aspects, are they even very interesting anymore?",Rotten
A good romance with plenty of adventure to entertain both sexes.,Fresh
"A handsomely assembled non-musical version of the legend ... the chinks in the armor creep in with James Franco, all lathered up in a weepy soap opera performance.",Rotten
"It has action and intrigue, diabolic plots, a tournament of champions, and everything else you would expect from a medieval movie, but it has a tendency to over tell the story and needs more romance.",Rotten
The film's roots and execution are faithful to the source and allow the emotional and thematic complexity of the tale to shine through.,Fresh
"A poignant, old-fashioned, history-heavy forbidden romance",Fresh
"The legend of ""Tristan & Isolde"" happened a long time ago, so the story goes. And here it's retold as an average film that could have been worse, but could have been better, for the resume of director Kevin Reynolds.",Rotten
It's so cheesy and corny.,Rotten
"The movie attempts a sort of documentary realism in depicting a period that is largely undocumented %u2026 but as was the case with the flat-footed King Arthur of two years ago, you may miss the magic.",Rotten
...never out-and-out boring...,Fresh
Much more A Knight's Tale than Romeo & Juliet,Rotten
A legendary love story set amidst violent clashes between English warlords and an Irish king fails to impress.,Rotten
"Rustic and lusty, Tristan and Isolde looks great but still feels less than real, as if the cinematic exaggerations actually diminish the central story.",Fresh
"Frequently rubbish but nonetheless enjoyable swashbuckler, despite a tendency to take itself a bit too seriously. More fun than King Arthur.",Fresh
"Swords clank, star-crossed lovers yearn, yadda yadda yadda.",Rotten
"Fans of historical epics will find much to like in the costuming, battle sequences and cinematography, but the love story itself is underdeveloped.",Rotten
"The two leads, James Franco and Sophia Myles, generate a modicum of chemistry, despite being penned in by a clunky script.",Rotten
Pretty and rather dull.,Rotten
A compelling story washed down for a film that's likely only appeal to pre-teen girls.,Rotten
"Unlike Franco's mop, no amount of teasing can keep this romance from falling flat.",Rotten
"By removing the sorcery and operatic excess so synonymous with the story, the filmmakers conjure an affecting, pretty melodrama... with the emphasis more on mellow than drama.",Fresh
A strong visual style and a violent streak only partially undone by the PG-13 rating.,Fresh
"The production is grimy and listless, without any color to be seen, literal or figurative -- not even those little red dots meant to deter piracy. But then, there's not much danger of that.",Rotten
"Funciona principalmente gra√ßas √† maneira eficaz com que retrata o amor do casal-t√≠tulo, que jamais deixa de soar convincente.",Fresh
"A movie in which all necessities are captured in two hours of ambitious celluloid, except for one critical anchoring piece: a heart.",Rotten
"one of those movies you keep in that special shelf, to watch them when you're ready to kill yourself, just to make sure you made the right decision",Rotten
"Tristan & Isolde isn't the sort of film you'd go out of your way for, but you could certainly do a lot worse.",Rotten
No Wagner libretto and not much depth or soul.,Rotten
[Tristan and Isolde] moves so sluggishly that someone must have been dosing the cast and crew with Nyquil.,Rotten
Strikes a good balance between action and romance in this version of the medieval legend.,Fresh
"You watch this benumbed retelling of the ancient legend thinking, ""This, too, shall pass.""",Rotten
"The performances are all raw and natural, and they are filmed in a close-up and often very intimate way.",Fresh
"Welcome to the world of film festival cinema. We hope you enjoy your stay, or at least don't fall asleep in the next hour and a half.",Rotten
"Lifshitz successfully maneuvers his trio of outcasts toward a state of grace: His vision of misfit utopianism, in its own quiet way, is as defiant as anything in Fassbinder.",Fresh
"The primary impression is lots of moping and mooning, + a song at the beginning with some of the worst lyrics you've ever heard.",Rotten
"The collage of poetic visual asides and emotional exchanges courts effusiveness, but it remains earnest and hauntingly expressive of an inner human turmoil.",Fresh
A morbid and self-important homosexual Jules & Jim for the new millennium.,Rotten
"Stony and statuesque, Michelini is an excellent casting choice: Her impassive face and dispassionate voice serve as a carefully constructed protective mask that hides her pain, and which she rarely lets slip.",Fresh
"Viewers are either going to walk out after 10 minutes or, like this tolerant critic, get caught up in the sordid lives of the three misfits and stick around for the ambiguous ending.",Fresh
"The film explains why Stphanie and her bisexual boyfriends need each other, but doesn't depict why they are drawn to each other, making the mnage  trois mechanical.",Rotten
A remarkable film.,Fresh
Lyrical yet succinct.,Fresh
"Lif****z obviously hopes for the best for Stphanie and friends, yet the film is filled with doubts and sadness.",Fresh
"Several storylines are hinted at but never fully developed, and some draggy scenes dampen the whole Wild affair.",Rotten
A weirder mnage  trois you will never encounter.,Fresh
"The woe-is-me, pity-please ambiance with which Lifschitz has suffused his movie becomes more than a little hard to take.",Rotten
For what the film had to work with -- a thin script -- it flawlessly achieved what it set it out to do.,Fresh
Auds might do better having this one delivered.,Rotten
Innocuous but forgettable.,Rotten
"Amid all the discussion of crust and sauce and the proper consistency of each, A Tale of Two Pizzas lays on the cheese way too thick.",Rotten
"There is some trite Italian-American stereotypes on display, and the interstitial animated sequences have nothing to do with the plot and drag down this otherwise sprightly comedy.",Rotten
"Any way you slice it, A Tale of Two Pizzas is so ineptly written and directed that it's pretty soggy entertainment.",Rotten
"Though it bears absolutely no relation to real life, this sweetly silly modern fairy tale possesses just enough charm to endear itself to secret sentimentalists.",Fresh
A sweet little film with heart.,Fresh
An unapologetic in-your-face thriller that's sure to take those who are expecting a typical Paul Walker movie by surprise.,Fresh
The aesthetically derivative Kramer takes a misguided turn into Tony Scott territory with his latest.,Rotten
A kinetic guilty pleasure.,Fresh
"The filmmaker whose work this most resembles is Guy Ritchie, except that Kramer actually seems to be taking himself seriously",Rotten
"Even though Running Scared doesn't quite nail it, it does hit the target for absurdist originality and pure cinematic delirium.",Fresh
"By the time this Malice in Wonderland reaches an inevitable crescendo, it's enough to make one want to hurry home and soak in a vat of Purell.",Rotten
"A giddily awful, awfully giddy action noir.",Rotten
"A frighteningly garish, over-directed mess...technically so fast and furious--to use a phrase its star will be familiar with--that it's the visual equivalent of an assault.",Rotten
"Tthe gimmicks can't hold up a weak, implausible plot that substitutes violence and gore for a smart story and believable characters.",Rotten
"If Quentin Tarantino and David Fincher shared a brain, developed a fever, then read 'Hansel and Gretel' and 'Oliver Twist' before falling asleep, they might dream of something like Running Scared.",Fresh
"I see Running Scared as a slick, sick, and sly satire of all the action flick conventions, but maybe I'm just nuts.",Fresh
I wonder if Peter Hyams can sue these people.,Rotten
"Those of you hoping for a remake of the delightful Billy Crystal/Gregory Hines buddy comedy are in for something very different with this Running Scared. Ultra-violent and hardcore, it's a worthwhile ride even though it doesn't all work.",Fresh
"I can't believe I am saying this, but Paul Walker doesn't stink in Running Scared. In fact, Running Scared is a decent guys night out movie.",Fresh
A flat-out atrocity of storytelling design that requires a thorough shower after viewing.,Rotten
A vile disaster.,Rotten
Paul Walker is the principal actor. Need we say more?,Rotten
"Kramer stokes kinetic energy and hard-R intensity...may amount to no more than a punch to the gut, but...it's all in bad fun.",Fresh
Could have been a good exploitation flick if it didn't get carried away with piling on the plot twists.,Rotten
"It's lower on the food chain than a mere exploitation picture because it clings so desperately to the notion that it's a serious movie about violence; it doesn't even have enough integrity to serve up cheap, sick thrills for their own sake.",Rotten
genuinely clunky,Rotten
Writer/director Wayne Kramer's approach to storytelling is to withhold any information that might give away the plot. The film is a string of violent confrontations between characters whose relationships to each other are unclear.,Rotten
A potential howler done in by a tendency to wear too much body tissue on its sleeve.,Rotten
"In the gleefully violent Running Scared, the writer and director Wayne Kramer tries to go over the rainbow and put a self-consciously bloody spin on once upon a time.",Fresh
"With a complex plot that unspools with surprising clarity, Running Scared displays a reckless intensity.",Fresh
"The hallucinatory crime thriller Running Scared, written and directed by Wayne Kramer, is pretty awful.",Rotten
"Running Scared goes so far over the top, it circumnavigates the top and doubles back on itself; it's the Mobius Strip of over-the-topness. I am in awe.",Fresh
"Everything feels begged, borrowed and stolen from other better movies, from Quentin Tarantino's exclamation-point violence to the slo-mo bullet trajectory shots from The Matrix.",Rotten
"If Running Scared sometimes looks like a storyboard sprung violently to life, Kramer's assured direction turns that into its greatest strength in the clinches, of which there are plenty.",Fresh
It's like a gruesome merry-go-round filled with unpleasant characters and bad acting.,Rotten
"Luciano Pavarotti's eyebrows during the Olympic opening ceremonies were disturbing. Multiply that by about 1,000, and you have the creep-out factor in the gory Running Scared.",Fresh
"If it's possible to admire his movie's heedless energy, it's also possible to hate its guts.",Rotten
This is the kind of movie where character development consists of a guy mentioning in passing he has a meth lab in his back yard.,Rotten
"If Running Scared were set in Hell (the actual place, rather than a figure of speech), perhaps it would have been easier to swallow.",Rotten
"Running Scared is decently acted and divertingly brutal, but it's also a giant step backward for its maker.",Rotten
"A spinning-plates movie that only makes a shattered-glass mess in its finale with one twist for each character left standing. Otherwise, this empty-calorie eye-candy cartoon is an ultraviolent, boot-on-throat thiller with style and humor.",Fresh
"Running Scared keeps ratcheting up the intensity, but to what end?",Rotten
"Ethnic stereotyping, moral qualms and plot improbabilities aside, you just wish a movie like Running Scared wasn't so anxious to be exciting all the time: It gets so monotonous.",Rotten
The only things more abundant than gunshot-riddled corpses are the ridiculous plot twists and the laughably bad lines of dialog...it's likely to be the most fun at a bad movie you'll have for a while.,Rotten
"The clunky happily-ever-after ending is a bit too nicey-nice but with all of the wall-to-wall action, ultra-violent gunplay and over-the-top writing it is an amusing ride.",Fresh
"May be the first original screenplay that unfolds in a setting so grim, despairing and yet slightly hallucinatory that it could've been adapted from Grand Theft Auto.",Fresh
"There's clearly supposed to be tension between Joey's good and bad sides. Sure, he's a mobster, but he's also a family man, which makes him... gray. (Not black and white = very sophisticated.)",Rotten
"[Director Wayne] Kramer, who showed such promise as a filmmaker with The Cooler, takes a couple of giant steps backward with Running Scared.",Rotten
"In the opening minutes of Running Scared, a drug deal goes bad and takes the entire movie with it.",Rotten
"It's way too violent and perversely excessive for many tastes, but there's more to its outrages than meets the eye, and that second look is well worth taking.",Fresh
[It's] generic pulp with some serious plot holes and more crane shots than any film needs.,Rotten
"There is a child at the center of this ultraviolent story, and the devices used to keep us on tenterhooks regarding his survival are appallingly manipulative.",Rotten
"Let me be clear. I'm not saying I liked Running Scared from the get-go or for all the way through, start to finish, but I did like it all the same.",Fresh
"A ferociously energetic piece of filmmaking, Running Scared makes the seedy Vegas milieu of writer-director Wayne KramerWayne Kramer's first feature, The Cooler, look as tasteful as The Sound of Music.",Fresh
"Running Scared is for people who like movies, who don't need to have a movie mean something in order to enjoy it and who can delight at the sheer craft of a story designed only to shock, amuse and hold an audience.",Fresh
"For a moment, it appears as if Running Scared has developed into a different, better movie. But subsequent gratuitously violent scenes hint at a determination by Kramer to keep his film at low-grade exploitation level.",Rotten
It's hard to believe that this mess was made by the same man who made The Cooler.,Rotten
"I chuckled along with the audience at every garish twist (at least for the first 60 of the the movie's 120 minutes), yet even as Dali-esque nightmare, the movie eventually became off-putting.",Rotten
"The film is comically profane, hyperviolent and studded with perverse details.",Fresh
"It's borderline irresponsible, a virtual horror movie of a gangster thriller.",Fresh
"It's ridiculous, over-the-top and as allegorical as The Warriors, in its own twisted way, only far more convoluted and darkly funny. And it's probably the year's first action movie spurred by actual, provocative ideas.",Fresh
"Kramer seems to be aping Quentin Tarantino's brilliant tangents in Pulp Fiction, but he doesn't have Tarantino's imagination or gift for dialogue.",Rotten
This overlong fantasy of urban violence is so far over the top -- you might as well be watching a computer monitor while somebody else has a high time playing the video game Grand Theft Auto.,Rotten
"Running Scared is a vicious and brutal B-movie jacked up to hysterical, hallucinatory proportions -- a pulpy, violent action picture that torments the viewer as much as its characters, and I mean that as a compliment.",Fresh
"With a herky-jerky visual style and a plot riddled with bullet holes, Running Scared is a brutal, misanthropic and downright nasty excuse for bang-bang entertainment.",Rotten
"As the movie becomes more howlingly ludicrous by the second, it's tempting -- and not in a cynical way, either -- to start reading it as a parody of pornographic video game violence.",Rotten
"[Writer/director Wayne] Kramer has discovered a new apogee of awfulness with this utterly obscene movie, which makes no bones about its own idiocy...",Rotten
Kramer's grating bombast exists only to call attention to itself as well as the complete absence of any moral implications or recognizable human behavior in the film.,Rotten
"The script is so stupid that at times you'll want to roll your eyes in the dark; you won't, though, because you might miss some of the action.",Fresh
"But even beyond its sleazy pandering and sensationalism, the film's worst transgression is its exploitation of young children.",Rotten
"It drags on and on and on and on...and on. We never thought we'd ever say this, but Paul Walker deserves better.",Rotten
"An exhilarating bloodbath of a film, Running Scared may not be perfect, but it's got adrenaline, wild eyes and sleaze to spare.",Fresh
...an abhorrently exploitative exercise in child endangerment.,Rotten
You could laugh off the film's more over-the-top aspects -- including the performances and its quasi-Quentin Tarantino dialogue -- if it didn't treat women and children with such brutality and contempt.,Rotten
Running Scared is not only toxic but irresponsible in the way it exposes young characters to a steady barrage of sleaze and violence.,Rotten
"Running Scared is about as hard an ""R"" rating as you can get, with buckets of blood, full- frontal nudity and swearing that would peel gum from the sidewalk.",Rotten
Running Scared will be reviled by those who deplore violence and adored by those who like their movies brutally edgy.,Fresh
"Running Scared will probably play best in prisons, where lowlifes, applauding the heroic amounts of foul language and blood, will be heartened to know that society has finally stooped to their level.",Rotten
"A depressing piece of gun-crazy Hollywood scuzz that, with its gassy style and runaway immorality, makes a Tony Scott movie look like a Robert Bresson picture.",Rotten
"Too bloated with its own seriousness to achieve the 'so sick, it's funny' vibe of Kiss Kiss Bang Bang.",Rotten
Includes scenes that are laughable [gunfight in a 10x10 room] and one that features Vera Farmiga that will go down in history as a classic/fan favorite.,Rotten
"For a picture so fetishistically obsessed with death, Running Scared is vibrantly alive.",Fresh
"Impossible to adequately summarize, alienating at every tonal turn, off the rails with every storytelling and aesthetic choice, Running Scared is ambitious to a fault.",Rotten
Filmmaking for people who find the films of Guy Ritchie too understated and wish Natural Born Killers weren't so slow-paced and minimalist.,Rotten
"Running Scared is an overly ambitious guilty pleasure with enough action and violence to keep you interested, it just doesn't have much else.",Fresh
"This is a movie with yards and yards of plot, but none of it that makes much sense nor that you'll think about afterwards. Instead what you'll remember is the blood.",Rotten
"races along the thin line between tense thriller and overheated, campy exploitation flick.",Rotten
Running Scared doesn't go over the top - it refuses to even acknowledge that there is a top.. it's like if Tarantino directed The Warriors,Fresh
"The action movie is the cheese sandwich of film genres, but efforts like 'Running Scared' remind us all too rarely that they don't have to be Kraft Singles on Wonder Bread.",Fresh
A film with ADD.,Rotten

"More like 'Running with Scissors.' A terrible, awful, hilarious misfire. Folks, a new camp classic is born.",Rotten
This film is so over the top at times that it takes one's breath away.,Fresh
Creative risks pay off big in 'Running Scared.' They give the film a refreshingly different feel.,Fresh
Paul Walker's excellent tough-guy adventure begins with the proverbial bang.,Rotten
It's a current ultraviolent take on fairy tale malaise - a kid's story told by a psychopath.,Fresh
"Running Scared doesn't always work. All the same, it keeps up a nice pacing and throws in enough clever twists to keep the story interesting.",Fresh
It's ugly and it's vile and it's disgusting and it's creepy and it just got tiresome.,Rotten
It says something when the most sympathetic character is a kid who shoots his dad with a stolen pistol.,Rotten
Not since 'Very Bad Things' have I had this much fun with this kind of movie,Fresh
"Appallingly gross, filled with forced profanity, and atrociously edited.",Rotten
"Running Scared is filled with plenty of blood-splattering violence, profanity, sexual perversions, and whatever other deviant behavior you can think of. What it doesn't have is any cohesiveness or finesse.",Rotten
"Clumsily overwritten, straining badly to be a complex thriller but only generating small moments of believability.",Rotten
"Wildly stylized and endlessly inventive, Running Scared doesn't go over the top -- it blows the top off and proceeds to dance in the rubble.",Fresh
"The end result of all these cross-mob confrontations is an orgy of nihilistic violence that is curiously exhilarating, I am almost ashamed to say.",Fresh
"If Running Scared is supposed to be a satire, it's not funny enough to work. If it's meant to be taken seriously, then it's the most unintentionally funny movie of the past ten years.",Rotten
"Run away ... Just when you think Hollywood can't get any worse in an era of Bad Boys and Scream, it constantly surprises you with even more putrid product.",Rotten
"The movie doesn't so much wallow in the abhorrent side of humanity as it showers, bathes, and dresses in it before heading off to work at MTV.",Rotten
"Style overpowers substance in 'Running Scared,' but Paul Walker surprised me with his intense performance.",Rotten
"Where Running Scared is concerned I'm a victim who has decided, maybe unwisely, not to press charges.",Fresh
Trying for a Tarantino-like riff on ultra-violence and over-the-top police corruption ... 'Running Scared' is a film noir on steroids.,Rotten
"Presumably patterned after Robert Rodriguez's Sin City, but substantially more graphic, there is surely an audience for this empty brutality, but you would not want to know anyone to whom this picture appeals.",Rotten
"This is a vile, violent film with no raison d'etre.",Rotten
"No one in their right minds could call this a good film, but it's certainly unique.",Rotten
"The film's moral compass swings wildly out of control, blanketed in all manner of hyper-violent digital gore effects and a thick, black nausea of the soul. It's not even fun watching the monsters get their just deserts; it's just depressing.",Rotten
If you've ever wanted to see Paul Walker get repeatedly smashed in the teeth with a hockey puck then this is the movie for you.,Rotten
"If you love over-stylized gunshots and action sequences, Running Scared is likely to be one big ol' kinetic romp of bloody fun that'll have you pulling out the Kleenex and appreciating all over the place.",Fresh
"We haven't even mentioned the hockey puck torture scene, or the relentless ricochetting camerawork, or the multiple last minute switcheroos -- it's got more endings than Lord Of The Rings.",Rotten
"Ultimately, it is a serviceable, well-made thriller that earns its R rating.",Fresh
"You suspect you're in for a violent film when it opens with several balaclava-faced men in black bursting in on a group of thugs whose conversation is limited to constructions around the words ****** or whore. With ""Running Scared "" your suspicions would",Rotten

There's something films like this reflect in our nature... that we seem to delight in propped up monsters that give the protagonist an excuse to behave like one.,Rotten
"A montagem eficiente, com transies intrigantes, confere ritmo ao filme, que tambm se beneficia com a atuao surpreendentemente intensa de Walker. Pena que o roteiro seja to implausvel e o final, to absurdamente ridculo.",Fresh
"With audiences jaded by the usual sex and splatter, do the filmmakers have no qualms about juicing up proceedings with edgy but troubling material which clearly needs more conscientious handling? Apparently not.",Rotten
An example of a film I recommend just because it tickled my undercarriage.,Fresh
A well-acted piece that should appeal to anyone who enjoys the films of Quentin Tarantino and Robert Rodriguez.,Fresh
"Running Scared exists in that world of movies where there are no good guys - just bad guys, worse guys and worst guys.",Fresh
The action throughout Running Scared is involving and fast-paced enough that you don't notice the number of cliches being invoked in this film.,Rotten
"Wayne Kramer's latest film is a hard-hitting, visceral, over-the-top extravaganza of blood and bullets that doesn't let up for one second.",Fresh
"It's a Bland, Dull, Dumb Movie.",Rotten
The landscape will survive this desecration; it's questionable whether the actors will.,Rotten
"It's as goofy and crude as this sort of road movie usually is, but the drug jokes, bad language and endless sex wisecracks are bound to amuse the pre-teen and (young) adolescent set.",Rotten

"There are few genuine jokes here, just familiar comic happenings.",Rotten
"Ultraviolet will be studied with great interest in the future - not for its quality or its artistic merit, but rather to discover how a turd like this was made.",Rotten
"The violence is presented in such a childish fashion, that it has all the impact of a Pokemon battle.",Rotten
The special effects simply thrust Ultraviolet in an Xbox 360 for action set-pieces that are kinetic and colorful but surprisingly unexciting. Do we really care if she dies when she's just going to be regenerated anyway?,Rotten
"Ultraviolet wants desperately to be a provocative, high-concept action thriller. It is apparently trying to say something about fear and terrorism, paranoia and racism. But it looks more like a shampoo commercial.",Rotten
"The tale, beginning with narrated flashbacks that make it curiously seem like a sequel, essentially is an excuse for a seemingly endless series of ultraviolet, uh, ultraviolent, action scenes.",Rotten
"Wimmer has created no logical framework for flashy, ultraviolent and frankly cheesy sequences.",Rotten
"Wimmer is so brazen that he doesn't even bother to pretend that there's an original concept here: all his ideas are borrowed from other movies that borrowed from other movies that borrowed from The Matrix, and he doesn't care who knows it.",Rotten
"Kurt Wimmer's film epitomizes just about everything wrong with post-Matrix, comic book-/video-game-inspired, Hong Kong-action-style sci-fi thrillers.",Rotten
"Pic is hermetically sealed in a synthetic wrapping that's so total -- Sony's top-flight high-def cameras, visibly low-budget CG work, exceptionally hackneyed and imitative action and dialogue --that it arrives a nearly lifeless film.",Rotten
"Exactly what you expect--a slick, slight, energetic video game of a movie that is far better than most will admit.",Fresh
"Ultraviolet is nice to gaze at but otherwise simplistic, senseless, and eminently skippable.",Rotten
"Ultraviolet is all second act. There is no beginning to the story and no end; it's all middle. A non-sensical, hard to follow assemblage of action, completely devoid of any context.",Rotten
"An unholy combination of comic book and video game,...so awful that you'd swear it had been directed by Uwe Boll.",Rotten
Cool martial arts and special effects barely make up for laughably atrocious writing and acting and an obvious sci-fi premise.,Rotten
"...shot two years ago... and now being unceremoniously dumped into your neighborhood cineplex, which -- thanks to films like this -- has been cluttered with as much garbage as a Skid Row alley in recent months.",Rotten
"Great action... but unfortunately, the characters had to open their mouths. That's when Ultraviolet becomes ultra vapid.",Rotten
"Although it masquerades as a futuristic action-thriller, Ultraviolet functions best as a multi-million dollar commercial for Milla Jovovich's personal trainer.",Rotten
It's well known that writer/director Kurt Wimmer hates movie critics. Ultraviolet is the reason why.,Rotten
"Quite frankly, Jovovich should never let Wimmer do her any favors again and someone from the director's office should send Cassavetes' estate a letter of apology.",Rotten
"A confusing jumble of sci-fi jargon and random plot twists, where the characters know perfectly well what's going on but the audience doesn't.",Rotten
None of the actors is really any good -- though some have been impressive elsewhere -- but it would be unjust to single them out for failing to rise above the material; what would be remarkable is if anyone could.,Rotten

"The experience is merely interminable, wholly forgettable, and without the requisite thrills and spills.",Rotten

Ultraviolet takes all the badness of Catwoman and repackages it with the look of live action anime and the mentality of a video game you have no control over.,Rotten

Monumentally awful,Rotten

"Whether Six is a blessing or a boon to mutants or humans is one of the many things that are not clearly explained through all the flying bodies, flashing steel and grinding metal.",Rotten
"Ultrastupid, ultra-incoherent, ultrasilly -- and way, way ultraboring.",Rotten
Ultraviolet cleaves faithfully to its comic-book genealogy with a plot unobstructed by big words and images that rarely breach two dimensions. Ultrasilly.,Rotten
Wimmer ain't no Cassavetes.,Rotten
"Uwe Boll would be proud of this movie. It's pretentious and oh-so-serious. The tone of the movie is one of high art, but it stinks like a landfill.",Rotten
"Flat-out awful in almost every respect, Ultraviolet will hopefully drive the final nail in the coffin of the sci-fi/action-babe genre.",Rotten
The Yule log was way more entertaining.,Rotten
"It's not bad enough to be funny, but it's not without its moments. Most of those come when Jovovich, not the best with a catch-phrase, answers some challenge with a put-down she should have practiced more in between personal trainer sessions.",Rotten
"Her sword is red, her eyes are blue and her movie is horrible.",Rotten
"Anyway, we went to Ultraviolet so you won't have to. It was awful. Next time you go, okay?",Rotten
"Ultraviolet and the recent Resident Evil films mark this compelling Russian beauty as the unofficial queen of Xbox-ready junk movies, which are fast becoming the new century's equivalent of radioactive bug flicks.",Rotten

"When I saw the trailer for ""Ultraviolet,"" I thought: Well, here's another PG-13 movie with a slender, beautiful heroine in exotic garb in a flick made for fan boys."" I was right.",Fresh
"Overall, it's a film that can best be thought of as the work of a more cerebral Uwe Boll.",Rotten
This nearly incomprehensible guilty pleasure is actually a great deal of fun.,Fresh
"The real blood war is between this movie and the slightly better Aeon Flux, which Wimmer plagiarizes as freely as Equilibrium plagiarized Fahrenheit 451 and The Matrix.",Rotten
"The adventures of Catwoman, Elektra, Lara Croft and Aeon Flux were positively Homeric compared to this simple-minded Hi-Def tedium...",Rotten
"a kinetic art piece of color, sound, and movement that exists somewhere between the Underworld movies and Matthew Barney's Cremaster Cycle, with just a hint of Tron thrown in.",Fresh
"Jovovich, who's shown sensitivity in her dramatic work, looks spectacularly bored as she power-kicks her way through one bloody pile-up after another. That boredom, like the mystery virus at the center of the film, is contagious.",Rotten
This film might actually include some of the worst deliveries that I have seen in any movie in a long time.,Rotten
"Amid every action cliche in the book, outmoded stereotypes, and a plot derivative of every futuristic drama made in the last fifteen years, Ultraviolet comes off as nothing more than a pale copy of better, more inventive films.",Rotten

Ultra-dumb.,Rotten
"This is disposable cinema, to be wiped clean from the mind as soon it's over and mercifully forgotten.",Rotten
"Milla Jovovich may look hot in spandex and bangs, but if you want rapidly-cut, slow-motioned-for-emphasis spectacle AND story, take in some ESPN highlights or any production by NFL Films. At least you would be getting your money's worth.",Rotten

Ultraviolet is absolutely worth a look -- if not a listen or a thought.,Fresh
The cheesy CGI effects look like they were done on a 15-year-old Macintosh.,Rotten
The only redeeming feature is a production design so outrageously mad that you will genuinely have no idea what you're watching for more than half the time.,Rotten

"Despite the expository speeches draped over this like birthday bunting, the story remains largely incomprehensible.",Rotten
"Undemanding, unengaging, and glaringly unoriginal, Ultraviolet gives real comic books a bad name.",Rotten
"Really, you can't blame Ms. Jovovich.",Rotten
One of the worst movies of 2006 so far.,Rotten
"The most receptive audience will mainly be enlightened to know that you can make a movie as thoroughly unprofessional as this one and still get it released in 3,000 theaters.",Rotten
Woefully nonsensical from start to finish...,Rotten
"The repetition of the action scenes play like an avant-garde joke about the indistinguishable nature of Hollywood fight scenes. Think Warhol's soup cans, only with actors posing with swords.",Rotten

Luc Besson's Arthur and the Invisibles clears the smog left behind by the year's dubious family entertainments.,Fresh
The bucolic wonder buried in Luc Besson's Arthur and the Invisibles has been snuffed out by this alienating and dislikable animated film. As overproduced and acrid as The Messenger: The Story of Joan of Arc and The Fifth Element.,Rotten
Besson drags things out considerably for his young audience at 122 minutes. The CG work is clever but cannot measure up to Pixar's standards in cleverness or imagination. Nothing is fresh here.,Rotten
"[Actor Freddie] Highmore is sweetly exuberant, but the voice talent is uneven, and the only really clever bits find the CGI characters navigating real live foliage.",Rotten
Arthur's frequent returns to reality break the mood and seem to serve little narrative purpose besides beefing up Farrow's role.,Rotten
"The routine story and lack of real warmth make this a movie to endure with one's children, not to share with them.",Rotten
"Director Luc Besson admits he knew nothing about animation before he started this project, and it shows.",Rotten
"Admirably blends animation and live-action and has a lot on offer for kids, though adults will probably yawn more than once at the predictable twists and turns of the plot.",Fresh
"Several parts of the narrative don't gel, feeling designed simply to look cool or sound funny.",Rotten
"Somewhere between cute and weird, Arthur and the Invisibles tries to be too many things in a frantic bid to be uber-creative, young, hip and relevant, expecting its technological prowess to be heartwarming and impressive.",Rotten
...a cute and sassy little fantasy film that borrows from many sources (oft times forgoing originality for familiarity).,Rotten
full review in Greek,Rotten
"Predictable and overly busy, this sci-fi adventure should nonetheless appeal to game-savvy tots, especially those familiar with the source material.",Fresh
...there's exceedingly little here to hold the interest of even the most patient adult.,Rotten
"Starts off as an innocent, wholesome family adventure, but, when it becomes animated, Arthur is on the path to throwing back drinks in da club with Snoop Dogg and his posse.",Rotten
"The story isn't terribly original, but Besson gives it a fuel-injected energy...",Fresh
Besson ... even dresses up the main female character in the sort of action-babe getup assigned to Milla Jovovich in his own The Fifth Element.,Rotten
"The film touts its 'dazzling' hybrid of live action and 'groundbreaking' CGI, but the visuals can't compare to Happy Feet or any Pixar release.",Rotten
The underground adventures are an unfortunate mixture of po-mo snark and potty humor (some just plain pot humor as well).,Rotten
"Ultimately, Besson has made an interesting, if shaky in places, homage to childhood.",Fresh
"Luc Besson, the most-Hollywoodish of Gallic directors, has adapted his own series of popular (in France) kid-lit tomes to produce a glossy, expensive ($84 million) and long-winded mix of live action and computer animation.",Rotten
"A mishmash with a distinctive but disorderly animation palette whose top-notch voice cast -- including Robert De Niro, Madonna and David Bowie -- gets lost in the muck.",Rotten
... a stiff affair that mixes overripe live action and starchy CGI animation.,Rotten
"This children's epic is slowed considerably by a convoluted, multi-tiered plotline in which we bounce between the human world and the Minimoy one. None of the characters are compelling, despite the star-studded vocal cast behind them.",Rotten
"There's no time to sort out the players or the story as things rush ahead at an overwrought pace. Huge amounts of backstory are just plopped down in front of us, so fast and furiously that it makes little sense.",Rotten
"It's a pretty good picture, albeit a strange one.",Fresh
This mix of computer animation and live action promises much but never really comes together. Haphazard voice dubbing and lack of originality don't help.,Rotten
"The adventure turns out to be a drag. When Arthur goes on a ruby hunt, the movie shifts to animation, and he meets the Minimoys, fairy creatures who look like those troll dolls that become inexplicably popular every 20 years.",Rotten
"Arthur and the Invisibles makes an excellent case against casting animated movies with celebrity voices. There are people who make their living as voiceover artists, and they would have been infinitely better than the lackluster Robert De Niro.",Rotten
"Luc Besson has never been one of my favorite filmmakers, but he seems to have found his metier in children's fantasy, and this semianimated adventure is enjoyable and imaginative despite its formulaic qualities.",Fresh
"Mess that it is, it carries a distinctive tone and visual effort.",Rotten
Audiences should ignore this one until Arthur becomes invisible.,Rotten
"Succumbing to the in-joke trend popular in children's films, Luc Besson's visually attractive movie spoils its own fantasy spell with anachronistic references and a quickly resolved story line.",Rotten
"While technically polished and adequately executed Arthur, like most of Besson's movies, is a strangely soulless experience.",Rotten
"Besson is a pro when it comes to action movies, but this part live, part animation effort is a mess, highlighted by creepy animation, derivative plot points and a child star who speaks way too fast.",Rotten
"The story [Besson] co-wrote for Arthur is workable, even clever at times, but the visualization of the Minimoys and their crib is weird and almost aggressively off-putting -- like an episode of When CGI Attacks!",Rotten
The film jumps and starts all over the place and simply isn't cohesive enough to appeal much beyond youngsters.,Rotten
Luc Besson serves up a hybrid of live actors and computer-generated figures to tell a not-endearing-enough story about a boy who shrinks to microscopic size to find his missing grandfather.,Rotten
[Arthur and the Invisibles is] a film for kids who want to know what headaches feel like.,Rotten
"Nothing in this movie works. Maybe all that tweaking helped, but I'm not betting on it.",Rotten
"There's a reason American animated filmmakers don't use the great Robert De Niro, Jason Bateman and Madonna to voice their cartoons. These big names add nothing to this frustrating goulash of fairy tales and fantasy-film ingredients.",Rotten
This kids' cartoon from France is such a surreally demented attempt to connect with children that it's the equivalent of foie gras breakfast cereal or a bleu cheese milkshake.,Rotten
"Good intentions, a full complement of parts, and proper assembly do not guarantee a successful result.",Rotten
"It might have been just another humdrum children's film if not for Highmore, who brings the same charm he did in Charlie and the Chocolate Factory and Finding Neverland to this fun movie.",Fresh
"Directed by Luc Besson, this inventive family movie sets up the most delightful premise, then squanders it on the kind of yawn-inducing CG adventure you might expect from one of those long, plot-heavy cut scenes that slow down video games.",Rotten
"They look like a cross between anime and Jim Henson puppets. Fortunately, they look nothing like Pixar, PDI, Sony Animation or any of the other talking animal companies.",Fresh
"Apparently Besson became so enamored of CG animation's possibilities that he forgot basic rules ... such as the one about animation thriving on clear-cut, distinctive characters whose personalities are established in the first few seconds they're on screen.",Rotten
"The movie is too long by half for its relatively simple plot. And letting kids get antsy, as any parent can tell you, is the biggest sin a filmmaker can commit.",Rotten
"Arthur and the Invisibles may be a tale for children, but it's got the bad habits of a profligate adult -- the thing borrows shamelessly from its betters and then pretends to be self-sustaining.",Rotten
"An odd imp of a movie, Arthur and the Invisibles may actually be filled with a bit too much invention for the average kid.",Rotten
"Too eccentric for kids, too silly for everyone else, it floats in a Neverland of breathtaking visuals in service of a story that pilfers everything (and I mean everything) from the Arthur legends to last summer's The Ant Bully.",Rotten
This fantasy blend of live-action and digital animation is just never quite as wondrous as it really should be.,Rotten
"There are too many things out of whack here, and too many unanswered questions.",Rotten
"Oh, what a dreaded Pandora's Box has been opened by the success of the Harry Potter and The Lord of the Rings franchises.",Rotten
"The movie bing-bing-bings all over the place, repurposing fantasy novels, video games, Arthurian legends. Besson's grocery bill for all I know. Even the musical score has multiple-personality disorder.",Rotten
This is no committee-engineered product designed to boost first-quarter profits; Besson actually wants to be here.,Fresh
"I know this is supposed to be a children's fantasy and that the color of the Miminoys' skin should be less remarkable than their microscopic stature, but the message seems to be that an African tribe can't be cute unless it is also white.",Rotten
A movie with imaginative elements but little imagination.,Rotten
Imagine the Smurfs meeting Troll dolls in the world of The Dark Crystal...,Rotten
Youngsters should have a fine time. Adults not easily persuaded that any children's film is automatically charming might bring a book.,Rotten
"To put it bluntly, this film has more plot holes than a Swiss cheese.",Rotten
"Highmore has been given a free pass from Besson to act his little heart out, and this gifted kid has decided to use the Dakota Fanning 3000 method of predictable, robotic child acting. It's disappointing to witness.",Rotten
"It took me a few minutes to get used to the strange look of the Minimoy universe in 'Arthur and the Invisibles,' but I soon became enchanted with it.",Fresh
Arthur and the Invisibles has a story so psychedelic that each movie ticket purchased should also include a black light poster and some incense. Kids weaned on the likes of Pixar and Shrek won't know what to make of it.,Rotten
Five pounds of poo in a one pound bag.,Rotten
"Luc Besson has made a fair share of artfully bad movies. Arthur and the Invisibles -- half-live-action, half-CG kid's adventure -- is (by a hair) more bad-bad, like The Fifth Element, than good-bad, like The Big Blue.",Rotten
"With its Day-Glo colors and fast pace, this $80 million live action/animated film may be the first acid trip for kids.",Rotten
"Whatever its flaws, Arthur and the Invisibles has a handmade, personal feel that finally affords it a cockeyed endearing quality.",Fresh
"Luc Besson's half-baked live-action/animated fantasy looks like it was invented on the hoof: it's erratically plotted, poorly animated, overly derivative and too insufferably cute to interest anyone above undemanding toddler age.",Rotten
"The story is just incoherent, and the faster it moves, the more frantic it seems.",Rotten
Looks like European animation is still light years behind the US and Japan. Thank goodness for Highmore and Farrow - if only the whole film had been live-action.,Fresh
"I'm not sure what creeped me out most in Luc Besson's ""Arthur and the Invisibles,"" the awful animation or Madonna lending her voice to a ""child"" princess.",Rotten
Besson's labour of love is a feast for the eyes but leaves the imagination distinctly undernourished.,Rotten
"Brightly coloured fantasy adventure with a decent premise, but the animated sections don't really work, despite the efforts of a talented cast.",Rotten
The Minimoys are teeny-weeny kind folk with a keen fashion sense and a wicked-cool lair. They're just like what the Borrowers would have been like if they had lived in the field behind the Urban Outfitters production factory.,Fresh
"A lazy fairy-tale pastiche reveling in mite-size cherubs, which cribs from gnomic mythology, elvish lore, Harry Potter, Arthurian legend and can't-pay-the-rent melodrama.",Rotten
"Here is an overproduced, oversugared semi-animated children's fantasy adventure from Luc Besson that made me want to cringe into my +h seat, never to re-emerge.",Rotten
Strange and kind of meandering.,Rotten
"Things unfold in rote fashion, with nature-based gadgetry no more clever than those of The Flintstones.",Rotten
"In a year when a lot of big-screen animation felt like it came rolling off the video game assembly line, a little originality goes a long way.",Fresh
"Uma f√°bula divertida e inocente que conta com uma eficiente anima√ß√£o digital e traz Besson em um bom momento, o que √© algo cada vez mais raro.",Fresh
"In a clear-cut case of arrested development, the film that crowns Luc Besson's career is a magical phantasmagoria for the kids, and a derivative mess for their parents.",Rotten
Is it time for director Luc Besson to become invisible too?,Rotten
"A candy-colored fusion of Dahl, Dr. Seuss and the director's own mischeviousness",Fresh
"Unquestionably original, watching Arthur and the Invisibles frequently feels like sitting in on an elaborate video game.",Fresh
"Strangely, for a feature animation aimed at a younger audience, Arthur and the Invisibles is most entertaining in its live-action sequences.",Fresh
"Cute enough and cool enough at times that I would take all four of my nephews to see it, but minimal cute and cool isn't enough for the long haul.",Rotten
Stevan Mena's debut film carves up body after body in a ritual homage to the serial-killer genre.,Rotten
"The performances are better than one might expect from a cast of first-timers and lightly employed professionals, and Mena's characters rarely do the sort of spectacularly stupid things that provoke derisive laughter from seasoned horror-moviegoers.",Fresh
The acting and dialogue is as silly as the potato sack the killer wears on his head.,Rotten
There's much more left to the imagination than spelled out with digital artifice.,Fresh
The fanboy approach to filmmaking is always the same: Take a typical slasher-movie premise and copy all the things that impressed you when you were on the verge of puberty.,Rotten
Diehard horror fans may want to weigh in. The rest can see it soon at the video store.,Rotten
"If ever a movie deserved to go directly to DVD, it's this dreary horror treatment.",Rotten
The biggest shock this old-school 35mm slasher entry provides is the fact that it didn't go directly to video.,Rotten
"For a presumably heartfelt homage, Malevolence is surprisingly low-key and almost lethargic.",Rotten
Many scenes on their own show some great promise. But Mena can't get his film to work as a whole.,Rotten
"Basically, you begin to tick off all of the standard horror gags as they come. And they all come exactly as expected.",Rotten
"...certain sections of Malevolence are far more engaging than others, with most of the second act a complete write-off.",Rotten
Malevolence is the result of a film lover that spent their entire life striving to be the best they can.,Fresh
"Apesar da trilha de filme barato e dos dez minutos finais de projeo, que escancaram a falta de experincia do diretor-roteirista, o longa  bastante eficiente em seu segundo ato.",Rotten
retraces killing grounds so old and familiar that at times it seems little more than a fan boy's compendium of favourite moments from the last half century's worth of slash-and-dash mayhem.,Rotten
"A low-budget, underseen genre gem that makes up for occasionally stilted dialogue and unpolished acting with a remarkable visual sense and skillful command of building tension.",Fresh
It's the multidimensional characterization and dialogue that elevates this film far far above being just a vampire movie with a more literate back-story.,Fresh
Rent The Red Shoe Diaries instead.,Rotten
"Power, obsession, and death; Eternal embraces them all.",Fresh
"Eternal is a red-ripe, overwrought fetish feast that's sure to entertain fans of the lush, romantisized vampire genre.",Fresh
"Hope springs for ""Eternal,"" more an erotic character study than an unsightly bloodbath.",Fresh
"Tame and cheesy even by the modest standards of the genre, Eternal needs all the intellectual trappings it can find.",Rotten
"Lush, lurid and completely besotted with itself, Eternal is one of those movies normally found slinking around the ether of late-night cable television.",Rotten
"Real scares are few, in part because the major characters are unsympathetic.",Rotten
"Bram Stoker would be, well, horrified.",Rotten
"Half real, half fantasy... not much of Eternal makes any sense at all, and Pope's police work is some of the shoddiest on screen, ever",Rotten
"While Eternal starts off strong, with an intense supernatural and hyper-sexual undercurrent that's sort of interesting, by the start of the third act, Eternal slips into something near camp.",Rotten
[A] stylishly kinky exercise in blood-soaked eroticism.,Fresh
Quite silly and not especially scary.,Rotten
"It's impossible to overstate the silliness of all this, but it would still be a decent Halloween trick -- if it were Halloween.",Rotten
"A terrible script, pedestrian direction, and acting that's mediocre at best signify that Eternal...[is] ready-made, moderately sexy fodder for late-night Skin-emax.",Rotten
"Perfect for watching on video on a cool Cape Cod night, but maybe not so arousing in an arthouse for 10 bucks and change.",Rotten
Eternal is the kind of horror movie where the only horror is a misplaced vase.,Rotten
"Just by being true to the legend, as if Erszebet had truly lived, Eternal is an interesting work, an erotic thriller with a supernatural bent.",Fresh
That the acting is stilted and that the filmmakers and especially Pla take themselves so seriously serves to make Eternal deliriously silly camp fare.,Rotten
"Conrad Pla turns in a performance of such staggering ineptitude that it almost (key word: almost) reaches a so-bad-it's-good, Plan 9 From Outer Space brilliance.",Rotten
A desperate cop is in over his head under the spell of a reincarnated lesbian vampire with great hair.,Rotten
"I wouldn't recommend this for theatrical viewing, but as late night cable fare, it's an acceptable way for an insomniac to pass two hours.",Rotten
"There's no camp in this vamp; the lady, and the film, is a tramp.",Rotten
the photography only creates a sense of suspense that something worth seeing may eventually appear,Rotten
It was cooler when it was called Basic Instinct.,Rotten
This oddball mixture of bloodsucking horror and soft-core porn is both objectively terrible and perversely fascinating.,Rotten
Eternal is only occasionally completely stupid...but it's never very bright either.,Rotten
"ETERNAL is a sexy and stylish horror thriller from Canada that unfortunately seems to be re-treading all-too-familiar territory. It gets points for its lavish production design, but very little for originality or real horror.",Rotten
...this whole production might as well just be a music video featuring everything Elizabeth from lusting for blood to bathing in it and the process involved.,Rotten
Neron and Pla look like porn stars and have about the same level of acting ability.,Rotten
"But for all its exposed skin, the film's pulse is hard to find.",Rotten
"If you've ever lain awake at night wondering what might happen if someone were to combine the porny misogyny of Joe Eszterhas with the blood-soaked eroticism of Anne Rice, you can now rest easy; Eternal provides your answer.",Rotten
"You watch this brain-dead film in a similar state yourself, until its culmination at--where else?--the cheesiest of masked balls.",Rotten
"The exaggerated production values overrun everything, including director Charles Vidor, who hardly seems to know which way to turn.",Rotten
We have David O. Selznick to blame for this bloated two-hour-+ Technicolor remake.,Rotten
One of David O. Selznick's many attempts to shape his lady-love Jennifer Jones' largely immutable mug into the face that launched a thousand cinematic ships.,Rotten
A padded Ben Hecht script and Selznick's invariable tendency to overkill are equally to blame.,Rotten
"This film, for all its size and color, doesn't do much more by Hemingway's book than was done by the sentimental version of it played by Helen Hayes and Gary Cooper some twenty-five years ago.",Rotten
Sweep and frankness alone don't make a great picture; and Farewell suffers from an overdose of both.,Rotten
"Selznick's last film as producer is a vastly disappointing remake of the superior 1932 version of Hemingway's novel, a sentimental, overblown production with stiff performances from Rock Hudson and Jennifer Jones.",Rotten
"What Hemingway wrote as an interlude of amorous flutes and distant drums, Producer David 0. Selznick has scored for brass.",Rotten
An overblown Hollywood extravaganza that was universally condemned when first released and hasn't improved with age.,Rotten
"Perhaps what is most irritating about the film is that too many times an exciting scene of Hemingway's is shucked out in favor of a distressingly inferior one invented (if I may indulge the Muse a moment) by Ben Hecht, who is responsible for the script.",Rotten
This attempt to make the audience feel what the lovers were feeling failed because even to the least experienced in love it was plainly an artificial and external alteration.,Rotten
This long and often boring tearjerker is a disappointing remake of a 1932 film based on Ernest Hemingway's novel.,Rotten
This sleeper may very well be the best B-film ever made.,Fresh
"The Narrow Margin rumbles along at a good speed with a minimum of fuss, making beautiful use of its compact train locale.",Fresh
"One of the best B-movies I've ever seen, and deserves to be better known.",Fresh
"A hard-as-nails, noir-ish thriller from the often underrated Richard Fleischer.",Fresh
"Along with Ulmer's Detour, the ultimate noir ""aesthetics of hunger"" manifesto",Fresh
"The cast may be B-level, but the sharp writing, taut direction, and production values of the Richard Fleischer's noir thriller (which is superior to the 1990 remake) are not.",Fresh
...a stripped-down premise that's employed to watchable yet far-from-enthralling effect...,Fresh
"Rapid, concise, and beautifully photographed, The Narrow Margin is an exercise in craft with few reverberations beyond the fascination of its technological exactness.",Fresh
"Surprisingly, there are a few lulls, and the closing moments lack the zest seen in these edgier films noir, even though the screenplay holds more than one brilliant twist.",Fresh
"Like the down-and-out version of his Tailor of Panama character, Brosnan's performance here is a sincere treasure; possibly the most entertaining of his career.",Fresh
"Brosnan and Kinnear deliver one of the most satisfying ""guy movie"" duos since De Niro and Grodin paired up for Midnight Run.",Fresh
Manages to transcend the cliches of its basic plotline on the strength of the character-acting so richly developed by the film's two stars.,Fresh
This occasionally stylish effort from writer/director Richard Shepard just can't make up for its lightweight script.,Rotten
"A quirky yet commercial commingling of black comedy, seriocomic psychodrama, heart-tugging sudser and buddy-movie farce.",Fresh
"There's a good movie in the general proximity of The Matador, but it only crosses paths with the one you're watching in a couple of scenes.",Rotten
"The Matador has that shiny sheen that quickly fades, yet is still fun while it lasts.",Fresh
Brosnan's performance as a once-smooth hitman who has lost his mojo is as funny and as fearlessly absurd as anything he's ever done.,Fresh
...moves at a brisk pace and features a pair of exceedingly enjoyable performances...,Fresh
Dark comedies like this one are far too rare these days.,Fresh
A deft psychological thriller.,Fresh
A painful morass of Odd Couple bickering and Elmore Leonard-style criminal kookiness.,Rotten
"What emerges is a film about friendship, albeit a very unusual friendship, and Shepard fills the screen with bright, rich colours in order to keep the film visually interesting during the frequently hilarious dialogue.",Fresh
"Slightly more engaging than most, even when the plot starts to stretch rather thin in the final act",Fresh
"Neither challenging nor incompetent, the picture isn't courageous enough to fail and thus not courageous enough to be a masterpiece.",Fresh
Just sit back and enjoy the fun.,Fresh
"The movie has a nicely modulated mix of comedy and pathos, but succeeds as much because of the two lead performances as Richard Shepard's writing and directing.",Fresh
"Mixing comedy and the hit man thriller, Matador is a dialogue-driven buddy film about two disparate men (Pierce Brosnan and Greg Kinnear) who meet in a hotel bar--and help each other go through mid-life crisis.",Fresh
Explores the friendship between a hit man and a suburban businessman that strains belief and leads to a totally improbable finale.,Rotten
"In someone else's hands, this movie could have been terrible, but taken on by Shepard it ends up being a silly adventure bursting with quirky flavor.",Fresh
...a captivating comedy. Brosnan gives the best performance of his career. Kinnear is a true comic genius.,Fresh
Rarely does an ensemble cast of such limited numbers create such charm and entertainment derived from plot and character.,Fresh
"It's a savage, breezy, occasionally obscene and sometimes poignant mix of comedy and crime.",Fresh
"Where an actor's comfort zone and preconception of audience expectation intersect, Richard Shepard's The Matador exists.",Rotten
Be sure to grab this one by the horns and enjoy the ride.,Fresh
It's easy to tell how much Brosnan relished this particular role as he practically licks his lips in pleasure after nailing key scenes.,Fresh
Shepard and his terrific cast turns a fairly simple premise into one of those rare buddy comedies that has both brains and heart!,Fresh
"An effective, wise, and frequently amusing entertainment that fondly sticks in the viewer's memory after the end credits have finished rolling.",Fresh
A testament to the relatively unknown Shepard's imagination and smarts.,Fresh
"The general details and color of The Matador fade quickly from memory while Brosnan's gamy, inscrutable libertine is still exhaling Scotch vapor in your face.",Fresh
Told with kinetic flair and a go-for-broke style that's more amusing than engrossing.,Fresh
"...plays a little classier, a little more hip than it otherwise might have due to Pierce Brosnan's rascally embracement of poking holes in his own image...",Fresh
"Sneaky, off-beat, satirically seedy psychodrama/thriller with Pierce Brosnan as a droll, comically demented hit-man",Rotten
...thoroughly enjoyable and equally shallow.,Fresh
"For a much better attempt at this kind of storytelling, make a mental note to some day check out Israeli writer-director Eytan Fox's Walk on Water.",Rotten
"Going from high to low, from happiness to sorrow, Julian's business is death, and with Brosnan giving the performance of his career business isn't just booming, it's murder.",Fresh
"Eventually, you forget Brosnan's ongoing effort to set fire to his trademark creased-and-polished image and begin to share his apparent glee in traipsing through this seriocomic farrago of crime melodrama, buddy movie and sob story.",Fresh
"Now that hoopla surrounding the holiday blockbusters has peaked, audiences will have a better chance at not overlooking this poignant comic gem.",Fresh
Brosnan enjoys one of his best parts in years and there is no mistaking his exuberance as he embraces the role.,Fresh
"Julian speaks for the film when he says, 'I'm a wreck, I'm a parody.'",Rotten
"Strong chemistry between the often-underrated Pierce Brosnan and Greg Kinnear helps turn what might have been an inconsequential genre exercise into a breezy, unexpectedly sweet odd-couple comedy.",Fresh
A hit man/buddy flick that has a heart? Not something I was expecting with this likable assassin-lite comedy that is both entertaining and darkly funny.,Fresh
The Matador gets a 151-proof tequila shot of sharp comedy from the droll byplay between Pierce Brosnan and Greg Kinnear.,Fresh
Maybe Brosnan is so shockingly good in this film because Kinnear gives him the sounding board and safety net that the actor never had in his sadly solitary spy-flick duties.,Fresh
"Pierce Brosnan plays a gold-chain-wearing sleazeball in The Matador, a weightless, amoral romp about a professional hit man facing a midlife crisis.",Rotten
The Matador feels like a cult gem that just might be able to target a larger audience weary of this season of self-important awards magnets.,Fresh
"Stepping into the role was a bold step by the retiring James Bond, and Brosnan's smooth fit comes as both a shock and a pleasure.",Fresh
The Matador teeters between comedy and moral inquiry but doesn't quite make it either way.,Rotten
"May not manage a clean cinematic thrust, but Brosnan puts on a fine, flamboyant show to keep the crowd entertained.",Fresh
"The cinematography is consistently hipster handsome, the script is bracing in its lewdness, and Brosnan adds no unnecessary weight to Noble's meaninglessness.",Fresh
"As January settles in to its usual mix of unspeakable turds and gravitas-laden Oscar contenders, a sucker punch like this is just what the doctor ordered.",Fresh
Richard Shepard's noirish movie is constantly couched in quotation marks.,Rotten
Funny and touching.,Fresh
"The film is darkly funny and ultimately rather endearing, and it's already been a big career boost for Brosnan.",Fresh
"The film rapidly devolves into a lame buddy picture, part thriller, mostly goof.",Rotten
"Good comedy depends on surprise, and throughout The Matador I had no idea where the film was going.",Fresh
"The Matador is admittedly a trifle in the long view of cinema, but it's an amusingly adroit piece of work nonetheless.",Fresh
"The movie's writer-director, Richard Shepard, balances the macabre and the sentimental, and understands that although his film contains questions like 'don't successful people always live with blood on their hands?' its real subject is friendship.",Fresh
"A colorful, freewheeling tale that never gets beneath its darkly comic surface.",Rotten
Brosnan struts through the movie practically sprinkling salt on the scenery.,Rotten
"Movie fans have seen any number of stories about hitmen, but it's a pretty good bet that even the most jaded of cynics will be unable to detect just where The Matador is going.",Fresh
Unevenly paced yet darkly funny and consistently intriguing.,Fresh
"The Matador strives for an airy, merry amorality, but it never quite achieves liftoff, though at times it comes close.",Rotten
"In The Matador, Pierce Brosnan plays another man with license to kill, yet he gives a performance wildly unlike his suave superspy. In fact, it may be his best role yet.",Fresh
The chief joy in this film is the balance of vulnerability and conniving slickness that [Pierce] Brosnan brings to his hit man and the easy kick that a middle-class husband and wife get out of knowing him.,Fresh
This comedy is as dark as it is oddly unpredictable -- and sporadically hilarious.,Fresh
"This edgy little movie may not cut as sharply as a killer's knife, but it carves out a very diverting niche all the same.",Fresh
"A tart comedy about economic duress and the mind-set of a soon-to-be downsized hit man, it's also a salty celebration of the romance and necessity of friendship.",Fresh
"Writer-director Richard Shepard's movie is just a sweet, broadly made buddy picture that happens to look a lot like an Almodovar production.",Fresh
"The Matador wants to be Sideways with two wacky guys out on a wild adventure, but the movie only has one guy funny enough to make it work.",Rotten
Writer-director Richard Shepard speeds through the hairpin turns of a pure-comedy 'what if?' premise....as quirkily suspenseful as it is ticklish.,Fresh
"It's the collision of worlds and ethical standards, along with a clever script and great cast that allow writer/director Richard Shepard's dark comedy to work.",Fresh
"The film has a lot going for it, particularly Brosnan in the title role. What it does not have is much novelty.",Rotten
"[A] really, really strong film.",Fresh
"insubstantial, but fun",Fresh
"A slight, but amusing character-driven buddy comedy.",Fresh
"A bit of mangled genre splicing, a tongue-in-cheek study of the old pro who knows he is losing his touch mixed with some rather middle-brow Dean Martin and Jerry Lewis style comedy.",Rotten
"Shepard's story isn't tight enough to rein in Brosnan, who's emotionally all over the map as the globetrotting assassin.",Rotten
The Matador is a superbly cast story that clearly marks Shepard as a filmmaker to watch.,Fresh
"[The film] forces the viewer to work too hard to buy its buddy pairing (Pierce Brosnan and Greg Kinnear), at times preventing the movie from being the goof it ought to be.",Rotten
"Unfortunately, writer/director Richard Shepard's pinata-hued comedy tries a little too hard for quirk, right down to its 'funny' musical score.",Rotten
"It's painful to watch as the movie basically destroys itself in the second half, slipping from its elegant thriller setup to tired sitcom shenanigans.",Rotten
"The destination isn't much to get excited about, but you're in good company along the way.",Fresh
Broad buddy-movie comedy gets old quickly.,Rotten
"Let the good times roll, and take a run at The Matador.",Fresh
As exceptional as [Brosnan and Kinnear] are... writer-director Richard Shepard's film is ultimately the formula buddy picture that one would expect from the premise.,Rotten
"This film is not so much a thriller as a comedy of bad manners. Action is kept to a minimum, but the conversation is what is interesting.",Fresh
"Buoyant and jazzy, The Matador is like one of those '60s capers where Michael Caine was surrounded by beautiful women and Alfa Romeos.",Fresh
Brosnan and Kinnear are a bullish odd couple.,Fresh
An almost perfect mix of heartbreak and humour.,Fresh
"How the two men become friends is as wildly funny as it is improbable, but that's the joy of this dark comedy.",Fresh
"Never as good as you'd hoped or as bad as you'd feared, The Matador is one of those of up-and-down experiences.",Rotten
"Une fort sympathique comdie dramatique sur l'amiti, les valeurs, le prix du succs et les racines des individus.",Fresh
"Although Brosnan is terrific, the rest of this dark comedy fails to reach the level of his tour-de-force performance.",Rotten
"There's a Tarantino-esque vibe to this film, but it does not have Tarantino's acid bite.",Rotten
A refreshingly tetchy indie wrapped in mainstream clothing.,Fresh
"Weird, but watchable.",Fresh
"Though violent and funny, and often both at the same time, the film by writer-director Richard Shepard is also a subtle and slightly skewed inversion of Brosnan's suave image.",Fresh
"You've never met anybody quite like the The Matador, even though you may think you have Pierce Brosnan pegged.",Fresh
"After you see this delightful black comedy about a hit man gone to seed, you'll never again pigeonhole Brosnan as a tuxedo-clad sophisticate with nerves of steel.",Fresh
"Whenever you think you know where the story is headed, Shepard unleashes another hard twist. Much of his excellence comes not in his storytelling but in the way he sets up situations that ooze with comic conflict.",Fresh
... an unpleasant and unfunny comedy ...,Rotten
This warmly-inviting black comedy plays like a David Mamet remake of Pulp Fiction.,Fresh
... Redefines the possibilities of the buddy movie.,Fresh
"... a dark comedy that is missing the laughs to be funny and the darkness to be, well, dark.",Rotten
Kinnear and Brosnan pull it off perfectly.,Fresh
... one of the smarter films out right now.,Fresh
... a wicked comedy with just the mildest amount of pathos to season the blend.,Fresh
An entertaining caper anchored by great acting and a couple terrific plot twists.,Fresh
"Pierce Brosnan's 'facilitator of fatalities' is a great character, but the story that houses him is as ersatz as the recording of 'In the Wee Small Hours' the assassin plays on the businessman's turntable (that's not Sinatra singing).",Rotten
"After the lights have gone up and the movie's mild jokes and predictable reversals have evaporated, you might still be haunted by the grinning rictus of Pierce Brosnan's dubiously groomed, ghastly attired hit man Julian Noble.",Fresh
"You can almost feel Brosnan's glee as he allows himself to let it all hang out, both figuratively and (almost) literally.",Fresh
[It] comes across... as a somewhat incoherent story told by a stranger in a hotel lobby bar.,Rotten
A breezy entertainment -- perhaps too much so.,Rotten
"Its best trait [is] the unique ability to walk the fine line, as Spinal Tap's David St. Hubbins would say, between stupid and clever.",Fresh
Imagine if John Wayne had played a rodeo cowboy. Or Clint Eastwood played a mall security guard. That's pretty much what happens to Pierce Brosnan in The Matador.,Fresh
"A constantly entertaining, invariably good-looking, bittersweet black comedy that's actually a lot more sentimental than it seems to think.",Fresh
Brosnan gives his most liberated and likeable performance since his Remington Steele days.,Fresh
"A punchy movie, with Pierce Brosnan happily trashing his 007 persona.",Fresh
It's almost as if Pierce Brosnan asked for a role as far from the debonair and cool-under-pressure James Bond as possible... and we're so glad he did.,Fresh
Brosnan walks the line between sympathy and repulsion as a cartoony lonely assassin,Fresh
"The Matador is a delight. Brosnan displays a wonderful flair for comedy, while Kinnear is perfectly in tune as his shocked, straight-arrow foil.",Fresh
"Even though it's a little too enamored with its edge and so obviously symbolic it could be called ""The Metaphor,"" Brosnan is at his best, and the movie's got more on its mind than guns, giggles and a weenie-meets-warrior vibe.",Fresh
"It's quirky (everyone says so, but it's absolutely accurate) and chock full of real live heart and truth and human connection.",Fresh
A strangely funny dark comedy with Hitchcockian overtones.,Fresh
"As a comedy thriller, The Matador is insufficiently funny or black.",Rotten
"Pierce Brosnan oferece, aqui, um dos melhores desempenhos de sua carreira.",Fresh
Demands to be loved in spite of itself and refuses to sugar-coat its characters for its audience. And that'll make it a love it or leave it film; there'll be no sitting on the fence after seeing this.,Fresh
Ole! for this off-kilter buddy pic with a darker side.,Fresh
"An amusing and original comedy that skips along with the quirky, charismatic shake-shake-shake of maracas.",Fresh
Casting Greg Kinnear (As Good As It Gets) to play the straight man to Brosnan's wacked-out whack-man was a stroke of genius.,Fresh
"Brosnan is performing his own high-wire act here, daring us not to like his sleazy, vulgar, insensitive, immoral character.",Fresh
"Thrives on its sleazeball hero being so colorful that you forget its thin, vacuous, amoral and improbable hit man story.",Rotten
... it does give Brosnan a chance to show his comic skills in an edgy comedy that is perhaps not dark enough for the subject matter.,Rotten
"in an ideal world, The Matador would be the movie to watch on a late Friday afternoon to start relaxing for the weekend",Fresh
But the gold star here goes to Brosnan. His performance digs deep into Julian's soul and it is that depth that makes the performance stand out.,Fresh
"Nice characters and situations: unfortunately, writer-director Richard Shephard didn't have much idea where to go with them.",Rotten
"Get past the stunt casting, and The Matador has very little to offer, despite all the hubbub surrounding it.",Rotten
A chemistry-free buddy flick.,Rotten
"Brosnan's irreverent charm makes this a welcome alternative to Bond nonsense, even if it's insufficient to compensate for dreary Kinnear ...",Rotten
"Brosnan's work as a monster who'd like to become human, but has no idea how, is painfully funny.",Fresh
...a hip and hilarious dark comedy.,Fresh
"With great performances, including a scene stealing show stopper from Brosnan, and tight direction, this is a great crises of conscience tale.",Fresh
"Brosnan's sleazy, broken-spirited hitman Julian Noble nabs the spotlight in Richard Shepard's generally pleasing comic thriller.",Fresh
"Absurd and quirky at times, The Matador plays like a ""Bizarro World"" variation of a James Bond film. It's beautifully shot, strange and deeply meaningful.",Fresh
Hope Davis' brilliant turn as Kinnear's naive but slightly naughty wife... is the cherry on director Richard Shepard's sundae.,Fresh
"Intelligently written with sparkling and witty repartee, intriguing quirkiness and entertainment value that is endlessly enjoyable, The Matador is the film to take a stab at this week!",Fresh
"Brosnan and Kinnear are up to the challenge, both delivering very solid performances. Brosnan seems to be having a lot of fun playing off his James Bond past, while Kinnear proves to be the perfect adversary.",Fresh
"All the shallow, self-absorbed denizens of Malibu seem relieved.",Rotten
Well-meaning but dramatically lopsided tearjerker bogs down in generic teen angst and domestic squabbling.,Rotten
"Smile is like a dose of cod liver oil: It may be good for you, but it's no fun.",Rotten
"There's little doubt that a nonfiction film would have been more powerful than this strained drama, which offers a Malibu brat as the audience's point of identification.",Rotten
"Overall, it's pretty elementary stuff, along the lines of a Disney Channel TV movie.",Rotten
This movie's so filled with admirable intentions that they practically spill onto the screen before it starts.,Fresh
"Despite terrific China locales and some capable castmembers (notably Wang), the flick gets bogged down by Jeffrey Kramer's strained scriptwriting and unrestrained direction.",Rotten
"Kramer may have felt that American audiences would have wanted to follow an American heroine, but it's Lin's story that resonates.",Rotten
Feels like a school project that has its heart in the right place if not the skills to produce something with depth and emotional heft.,Rotten
"This drama, which was bankrolled by the people behind the international Operation Smile program, has the best of intentions. But it's so painfully earnest that it becomes insufferable.",Rotten
"Good cause, bad movie.",Rotten
"Sure, it's mushy, but you can't make a movie called Smile and not be at least a wee bit saccharine about your intentions.",Fresh
"However worthy the sentiment, this one won't leave viewers with a smile.",Rotten
"It's intended to puzzle us -- and sure, the little puzzles peppered throughout the film are fine. It's the grand non-sequiturs that are distracting.",Rotten
"...a strange and beautiful work, but it doesn't quite cohere.",Fresh
Seductive and emotionally charged but maddeningly elusive.,Fresh
Invisible emotional and psychological tendons are the ties that keep the film from completely dispersing into non-sequential incoherence.,Fresh
"This mysterious object may be Denis's most gorgeous film (which is saying something), but more than that, it's a fearless filmmaker's boldest experiment yet, a direct line from her unconscious to yours.",Fresh
"Exciting, vital cinema that pushes the boundaries of what movies can do. It's a masterpiece.",Fresh
"The Intruder ... is exhilarating and exhausting, the kind of picture you don't bounce back from immediately.",Fresh
Claire Denis's magnificent enigma of a film explores the troubled soul of a brooding loner who travels halfway around the world to begin a new life.,Fresh
... the film is surprisingly satisfying and meaningful.,Rotten
[S]hould you see The Intruder? Yes -- but only if you're willing to ignore bothersome concerns about narrative and let the poetic images take over your mind.,Fresh
"Characteristically impressionistic, French director Claire Denis' latest meditation is simultaneously baffling and beautiful, and definitely not for everyone.",Fresh
Denis composes a majestic dream book of shots and sequences.,Fresh
"Never has Denis demanded so much from audiences as with this shimmering enigma, at once intimate and epic, but it's worth the effort and then some.",Fresh
"A beautiful, complex work that challenges viewers to mentally sift interior and exterior journeys.",Fresh
"Denis' film -- which may be her most intricately constructed and intensely beautiful to date -- is one that transcends words and stories, a movie to be felt rather than rationalized.",Fresh
"...an aesthetic mystery that requires at least two viewings to fully figure out. Luckily, the film is fun along the way.",Fresh
Visually ravishing and all-but-impenetrable.,Fresh
"An interior epic with epic exteriors, a film with very little dialogue, where the pictures (photographed by the great Agn√®s Godard), actors and the juxtaposition of both tell the story.",Fresh
"Using very little dialogue, [Denis] focuses on casting a lingering, physically enticing spell.",Fresh
"This is self-consciously intricate, but even if the storyline occasionally confuses, it's impossible not to admire Agn√®s Godard's glorious photography and the atmospheric soundtrack.",Fresh
"... the emotions and wishes and fears of the human animal thrown large on the screen in primal, lush images.",Fresh
"While it may take a few viewings to sort the details out, much about L'Intrus lingers, shimmering quietly in the memory.",Fresh
It's one of those films where it's best to go with its maddening elegiac but elusive flow and let whatever comes to you be enough.,Fresh
"yet another meandering piece of existentialism, signifying nothing except for what you're willing to project onto it.",Rotten
"A film that's so recondite, it's barely there.",Rotten
"Denis is one of cinema's greatest narrative poets, and The Intruder, the story of an adventurer, is her most adventurous cinematic poem.",Fresh
"The Intruder, however sketchy its plot or character motivations, is lavishly mounted, and will not fail to engage the mind and the eye on the huge Castro screen...",Fresh
The first twenty minutes of Saint Ralph seem more like a primer on the up-close-and-personal art of adolescent self abuse than subtle narrative exposition.,Rotten
"Thanks to the charm brought to the role of Ralph by young Adam Butcher, and strong performances from Campbell Scott, Gordon Pinsent, Jennifer Tilly and Shauna MacDonald, credibility is achieved.",Fresh
It's a heartwarming film that celebrates the healing power of innocence and faith.,Fresh
Unrepentant hokum.,Rotten
Writer/director Michael McGowan's feel for his underdog narrative seamlessly melds humour and heartache.,Fresh
"A fine, small movie that deserves a long run.",Fresh
Never develops any bite or tension.,Rotten
McGowan's film isn't just about following this boy's private quest to accomplish the impossible. It is also about how he affects the other characters in the film.,Fresh
Captures the feel of a relatively uncomplicated era and draws us into another impossible dream.,Fresh
"Saint Ralph is content paying lip service to Catholicism, choosing instead to pander to fans of anyone who got off during Children of Heaven and Millions.",Rotten
"Ralph Walker is no Max Fischer, and his monomania gets dull fast.",Rotten
"It's as if Max Fischer from Rushmore turned, mid-movie, into Billy Elliot.",Rotten
Michael McGowan's conventionally heartwarming underdog drama doesn't miss a cliche on the eccentric troublemaker's rocky road to sainthood.,Rotten
"I feel guilty criticizing it because it's about a kid running a marathon to save his mom from dying of cancer. CANCER, for crying out loud! What am I supposed to do with that?",Fresh
Saint Ralph is the kind of movie that makes you see why people can believe in miracles.,Fresh
"Saint Ralph has all the elements of a sapfest waiting to happen, but it never does, instead delivering its heart with solid doses of harshness and humor",Fresh
"You might shed a few tears at the tender moments between Ralph and his comatose mother, but you'll laugh and chuckle and feel good far more often.",Fresh
"An amiable sentimental fantasy, joining running, religion and a boy with a whole lot of problems into an earnest production that entertains even as it milks some of its situations for all they're worth.",Fresh
Touches the heart in unexpected ways.,Fresh
"This crude, inspirational tear-jerker is as sweet as a bowl of instant oatmeal smothered in molasses.",Rotten
"Written with the glee of a scheming Catholic schoolboy, but its geniality outstrips its plausibility.",Fresh
A tart and tender comedy that pulls off a little miracle of its own by being genuinely heartwarming without leaving any cloyingly sticky emotional residue.,Fresh
This deliciously offbeat Canadian comedy gets its charm from marvelous acting and from a screenplay bursting with ideas.,Fresh
McGowan employs well-apportioned measures of droll humor and emotional urgency while spinning the story of Ralph Walker.,Fresh
"This coming-of-age- comedy/period piece hits every cliched note in the underdog canon, yet still manages to involve, thanks to top-quality acting and sensible choices on the part of writer/director Michael McGowan.",Fresh
A charmer with heart.,Fresh
[The] film never runs out of surprises.,Fresh
"Both refreshingly realistic and charmingly implausible at the same time. A real miracle, indeed.",Fresh
"Light lessons about pain, endurance, and commitment...Likeable to a point, but in the end, Saint Ralph winds up incredible, manipulative, and strictly for the choir.",Rotten
"Michael McGowan's direction is as flat as an asphalt road, and his script is gasping for air long before it enters the final stretch.",Rotten
A heartfelt story about a teenager who proves that ordinary individuals can do extraordinary things through strong intention and a little help from their friends.,Fresh
It's worth seeking out this bittersweet comedy with its emotionally resonant story and stellar performances.,Fresh
McGowan's film demonstrates how sometimes the strongest acts of faith can only occur entirely outside the church.,Fresh
"Even when it's pushing the limits of shameless manipulation, this cheeky Canadian film has charm and wit.",Fresh
"The lack of condescension, the decent jokes and an absolutely terrific performance by Butcher make Saint Ralph an honest-to-God crowd-pleaser.",Fresh
You can't argue with the message. But its well-worn homilies might give you reason to question the messenger.,Rotten
"It's hard to dislike schmaltz as mild as Saint Ralph, but let's try: The film is as bland as a communion wafer, sentimental as a Christmas homily, and predictable as the liturgy.",Rotten
What began as a too familiar coming-of-age story set in an all-boys Catholic school steadily morphs into something arguably as familiar but more satisfying -- a triumphant sports tale.,Fresh
Your interest is bound to fade long before Ralph does.,Rotten
Writer-director Michael McGowan must be exhausted after all the tugging he does on our heartstrings in this sentimental drama.,Rotten
"Saint Ralph sticks, for the most part, to the road less traveled, delivering a droll feel-good movie that has a little something to say about modern-day miracles.",Fresh
Writer-director Michael McGowan proves there's a reason people keep making underdog sports movies.,Fresh
"It succeeds in flashes, but the movie's mixture of humor and inspirational fluff never quite meshes.",Rotten
"As predictably uplifting movies go, Saint Ralph isn't completely charmless.",Rotten
"Occasionally, a movie that makes only the faintest blip, if any, on the hype radar just shows up and gets it right.",Fresh
"Going beyond the never-say-die concept, McGowan paints an evocative picture of provincial life and mostly steers clear of cliche.",Fresh
"Pushes itself as strenuously as its young protagonist, but ultimately collapses in a welter of sentiment, cuteness and whimsy.",Rotten
It's all very cute and predictable. Still it's a fun movie...,Rotten
"Funny, touching and uplifting.",Fresh
"If McGowan pushes the religious themes too hard, his greatest sin is that he leads you to believe that the story is true.",Rotten
"The movie rests on (Adam) Butcher, and the actor proves to be a well-rounded smart aleck in the making.",Fresh
"Ralph may be more a sinner than a saint, and his movie may be a little cheesy, but who cares - I thoroughly enjoyed following him on his quest.",Fresh
"...a small, straightforward story that has its heart in the right place, even if its hokey sentimentality keeps it from reaching the finish line.",Rotten
"An overly convenient plot is the main con in Ralph, which includes a devastating fire, an assist from a celebrity and at least one miracle, all of which show up exactly when the plot needs help moving forward.",Rotten
Canadian writer-director Michael McGowan has packed it so full of earnestness that viewers end up jogging along.,Fresh
"The comic aspects of this comedy-drama are overly broad and forced, while the supposedly dramatic ones are cloying and treacly.",Rotten
This wincingly earnest comedy-drama could rival the maple tree as Canada's leading producer of sap.,Rotten
A hooey-slathered film that combines the Catholic school humor of 'Do Black Patent Leather Shoes Really Reflect Up?' with the rah-rah uplift of an underdog sports story.,Rotten
"Butcher carries the film well, interpreting Ralph as a tangle of mixed-up yearnings tempered with an indomitable drive.",Fresh
A likable little underdog-triumphs drama from Canada... This is a case where my idealistic side won out over my cynical side.,Fresh
"For the jaded moviegoer, here's a little film that just might restore your faith -- in movies and a whole lot more.",Fresh
What writer-director Michael McGowan has pulled off is a bit of a miracle.,Fresh
"The heart of the film and ensemble, however, is Adam Butcher. If there's any justice, this guy could have a hell of a career. Highly recommended.",Fresh
"Chooses to embrace, rather than transcend via zany bawdiness, the schmaltzy genre within which it's operating.",Rotten
"It argues, ironically, that pretty people should only end up with pretty people, and the best we can do is hope that the temp with bad hair will find us equally nerd-hot.",Rotten
This romantic comedy about losers in love gave me some laughs but couldn't make me fall in love.,Rotten
"promising, quite funny, but ultimately underwhelming",Rotten
The Baxter nods to better-behaved comedies of the past.,Fresh
"Sex doesn't figure into The Baxter, Showalter's strained romantic comedy; exaggerated arrested development does, of a guy kind that congratulates adult men on their dweebishness, assuming that dweebishness is of the hipster Brooklyn variety.",Rotten
"If there is one real treasure to be found in The Baxter, it is in Justin Theroux's inspired parody of Sebastian Junger...laugh-out-loud funny whenever he's on screen",Rotten
"Showalter pushes too far: Nerdiness, after all, can be only so attractive.",Rotten
"A Baxter of a movie: well meaning and mildly likable, but unlikely to sweep you off your feet.",Rotten
Savvy viewers will see through this pastiche of shopworn goods.,Rotten
The Baxter is more than a little out of step in a summer peppered with crude or idiosyncratic wallflower romantics.,Rotten
"If [Showalter's] acting is misjudged, his direction is merely uninspired.",Rotten
Allusions to '40s screwball and later offerings like Annie Hall have a mild resonance as The Baxter struggles to get its footing.,Rotten
"This wry, low-key comedy swims defiantly against the stream of contemporary comedy, eschewing bodily-function jokes and obvious gags in favor of laughs so sly and self-effacing you could almost overlook them.",Fresh
"This innocuous flick tries to evoke screwball rom-coms of the '40s, but despite a few chuckles, it misfires with predictable plotting and forced farce.",Rotten
"The Baxter is an ideal date movie because it's sweet, it's funny and it doesn't insult anyone's intelligence.",Fresh
The only way to even guess that humor is being attempted here is to monitor the comical faces mustered by the actors.,Rotten
There are enough laughs in it if you're willing to settle.,Rotten

His party-of-one status is a result entirely of his own noxiousness.,Rotten
"A tender love story and a dead-on lampoon of the genre, but its main drawback is that Showalter is egregiously miscast in the title role.",Rotten
"The more the film stresses and strains to be funny, the unfunnier it gets.",Rotten
"Writer-director Michael Showalter flirts with a great premise, but his slight love story gets cold feet.",Rotten
"It contains a wry, throwback charm.",Fresh
"If wry, understated character comedy is up your alley ... you'll likely dig this movie.",Fresh
"Like Elliot himself, the film aspires to be no more and no less than what it is, a thoroughly charming and satisfying romantic comedy with charismatic quirkiness.",Fresh
"A sweetly engaging homage to the dizzy screwball charmers of Hollywood's golden age, The Baxter is a happy surprise enlivened by its cast's appealing performances.",Fresh
"What's surprising is Justin Theroux, who's actually hilarious.",Rotten
"It's a terrible comedy and a worse movie, and I'm hoping, like its namesake, people leave this at the alter and look elsewhere for their entertainment. I know I wish I could have.",Rotten
"Michael Showalter is a funny man, but ... how to put this gently ... not a funny movie star.",Rotten
"The problem with The Baxter is right there at the center of the movie, and maybe it is unavoidable: Showalter makes too good of a baxter. He deserves to be dumped.",Rotten
Showalter's Elliot Sherman gives 40-year-old virgins a bad name (something Steve Carell has done so much to disprove).,Rotten
"Starts off promising a new spin on the romantic comedy genre, and then ends up exactly like all the others.",Rotten

"No great shakes, The Baxter nonetheless has a quiet loopiness going for it.",Fresh
"While trying really hard to make Elliot a lovable loser, Showalter too often just renders him shrill and annoying.",Rotten
"Changeups are commendable and all, but Showalter may be guilty of playing too far from his strengths.",Rotten
Showalter all-too-slavishly follows the lock-step school of formula romance.,Rotten
"The Baxter is so ineptly conceived, staged, written and played that you suspect it's part of a psychology experiment to see if people will laugh at anything.",Rotten
"Mildly cute while thoroughly forgettable, the chief achievement of The Baxter is it serves to remind viewers how thoroughly adorable Michelle Williams can be, even in something this inconsequential.",Rotten
"The Baxter has many of the ingredients of a good-natured indie date movie. But when the lead performance isn't one of them, it gets difficult to recommend.",Rotten
The Baxter is a self-conscious one-man show that obliterates the fine line between 'quirky' and 'annoying.',Rotten
The Baxter is a good-hearted romantic comedy that achieves its uncomplicated comic goal of presenting an underdog love story filled with offbeat personalities.,Fresh
"Conceptually...The Baxter is hobbled, and all Showalter has is his concept.",Rotten
"Showalter's Elliot, self-described as the kind of guy who gets hay fever just raking the leaves, never breaks out of the Baxter clich. Frankly, he makes a pretty good case for why the sad sack never gets the girl.",Rotten
"With seemingly thousands of romantic comedies to slay, Showalter wound up joining the party instead of peeing in the punch.",Rotten
There are enough laughs that those who enjoyed The 40-Year-Old Virgin might want to take The Baxter for a whirl.,Fresh
"The movie is like an extremely faithful cover version of a song you like -- it adds nothing new, so what's the point?",Rotten
Is this enough on which to hang a full-fledged movie that people will pay to see? Probably not ...,Fresh
The biggest failing of The Baxter is that the humor is often just too obscure.,Rotten
"Think of ""The Baxter"" as ""Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dumped.""",Fresh
"Unlike Woody Allen's nebbishes, who are always the smartest and funniest people on the screen, Elliot is a bore.",Rotten
"Only when Williams is around does the movie seem human, true, and funny: Even in her slapstick there's pain. She's almost too good: It's not until she's left a scene that you realize the movie isn't working.",Rotten
"Anyone who's seen a few romantic comedies, the older the better, will find something to like about The Baxter.",Fresh
Perhaps it's only just that a movie about a loser should be a loser itself.,Rotten
Showalter tackles his mission with energy and an upbeat attitude that makes him a winner as a lovable loser.,Fresh
"The structure is a miscalculation by Showalter, who inexplicably drives his audience through the exact type of sappy material he had started off satirizing.",Rotten
Clearly the filmmakers are trying to make The Baxter look old-fashioned. But there's a modern smugness and superiority that undermines that attempt.,Rotten
"It doesn't take much imagination to guess who will end up with whom, but The Baxter is agreeably silly and has lots of simple charm.",Fresh
"Every romantic-comedy clich gets played out, but merely re-enacting those clichs in an arch tone isn't funny enough.",Rotten
"What comes to mind are TV sitcom pilots full of strain, and the forlornly perky mechanisms of old Day & Hudson comedies.",Rotten
Showalter cria um filme exatamente como seu protagonista: desajeitadamente simptico e divertido.,Fresh
"A droll romantic comedy that relies on a self-deprecating brand of humor which must be a bit of an acquired taste. The film's utter predictably sinks this exercise in obviousms, making its few funny moments not worth waiting for.",Rotten
"The performers are fresh and offbeat, with the diminutive Peter Dinklage (Elf, The Station Agent) especially funny as a gay wedding planner named Benson Hedges.",Fresh
This version of Twist is a flawless adaptation; finding the right balance between story and screen. Simply enthralling.,Fresh
"... a sincere, impeccably crafted retelling of a classic, invigorated by one of our best filmmakers working from a place of obvious passion...",Fresh
"A version of ""Oliver"" that's so safe, it's pretty much a case of baby-sitting.",Fresh
"Involving, captivating and nearly note perfect--in other words, a proper classic.",Fresh
The spark that an original point of view might bring to the oft-told tale is missing.,Rotten
"Conventional, straightforward and very much within what used to be called the Traditional of Quality, this handsome film is a respectable literary adaptation but lacks dramatic urgency and intriguing undercurrents.",Rotten
"Though Polanski doesn't bring a new angle to Dickens' classic, there's still reason to see his handsome, well-acted production of a tale not seen on the bigscreen in decades",Fresh
It is a film where art direction triumphs but genuine art remains elusive.,Rotten
Oliver Twist isn't the nasty affair Polanski fans might be hoping for.,Rotten
"The quality of mercy is strained, but by some strange feat it doesn't dissolve entirely.",Fresh
A good-looking production albeit one that is too straightforward and literary.,Fresh
"It's irresistible to read his sorrowful and seemingly classical take, from a filmmaker known as much for the schisms in his personal history as for the lurches in his work, as something much more personal and poignant.",Fresh
It is something special in these times of incivility to see a protagonist who stands apart from others with his good manners.,Fresh
That Polanski chose this as the movie he wanted to make for his own children feels motivated by more than a septuagenarian dad's desire to take a $60-million stab at a bedtime story. It feels inspired by a need to tell them who he is.,Fresh
It still stings in unlikely places.,Fresh
Any parents thinking of bringing their young kids to this very-hard-PG-13 downer have hereby been warned.,Rotten
"With tact and enthusiasm, Roman Polanski grabs hold of a great book and rediscovers its true and enduring vitality.",Fresh
"Deft direction, solid acting and exemplary production make ""Oliver Twist"" a worthy telling of the classic story and are the resounding answer to my...question: why bother?",Fresh
"Polanski...gives ""Oliver"" two prominent twists which impart a 'there but for the grace of God go I' undercurrent...the specter of the noose hangs heavily over this production",Fresh
A near-masterpiece.,Fresh
The roles must have been filled when the casting director was whacked out on prescription cough syrup.,Rotten
"Lacking energy and pace and enslaved by a ghastly score, this tepid movie left me longing alternately for David Lean's thrillingly grim 1948 masterpiece, and Carol Reed's chipper 1968 sing-along, with pretty tunes by Lionel Bart.",Rotten
This is that rare movie version of a great novel in which watching is reading.,Fresh
"Polanski and his Pianist scribe Ronald Harwood have chosen to tell it in as simple a manner as possible, as though they had been given a Masterpiece Theatre assignment to dispatch.",Rotten
It's just as Dickens wrote.,Fresh
"Polanski's adult fans deserve something more than a film for the kiddies, and Dickens deserves better treatment than merely 'tasteful.'",Rotten
Drab and unfeeling.,Rotten
"Is it possible that a film made in 1948 and by David Lean could exceed the darkness and controversy of a Roman Polanski picture? After watching the newest screen version of Oliver Twist, the answer is yes.",Fresh
"Polanski's take will spark debate among Dickens lovers, but audiences won't respond as warmly as they have to Lean's classic.",Rotten
"Polanski delivers an acceptable yet thoroughly uninspiring twist on the orphaned Oliver, who gets a raw deal every which way.",Rotten
"Languid and lifeless, stilted and, above all, surprisingly safe, Oliver Twist plods along, its impassive title character being tossed from one cruel fate to another.",Rotten
"You can look at it all and marvel, or recoil in horror at the barbaric exploitation of women and children. But the film remains an arm's length experience.",Fresh
"A work of craft that could be flying the Masterpiece Theatre banner. You know, an earnestly worthy adaptation of a literary classic, as faithful and polished as it is ponderous and unprovocative.",Rotten
"Though some may quibble with the changes Polanski and scripter Ronald Harwood have made to the book, mostly they get it right.",Fresh
Polanski's take on the classic is a dull affair.,Rotten
"Polanski seems so intent on... a grimly elegant big picture that... he misses the people. Oops, except for Ben Kingsley as Fagin, whom he lets run embarrassingly wild.",Rotten
"It's mannered at times, as you might expect... but the surprising thing about Oliver Twist is how deeply it resonates.",Fresh
"The idea of Ben Kingsley as Fagin is such an obvious fit that he isn't surprising, nor are his acting choices",Rotten
Technically accomplished and frequently engaging.,Fresh
"Dickens knew that melodrama answers to something permanent in our nature; without it, any version of Oliver Twist draws perilously close to the genteel.",Rotten
"The first question I have is, why? Why would Roman Polanski, one of the most innovative directors of the last half-century, want to adapt a story that has been told again and again?",Rotten
"Fails to topple Lean's untoppable version; still one of the best movies of 2005. Startlingly unemotional, but for the stormy torments behind Fagin's overhanging eyebrows.",Fresh
Roman Polanski's Oliver Twist is probably the most faithful adaptation. But hardly anyone will take notice; it's just a tale that's been told too many times before.,Rotten
"Someday, this may even replace Cliff Notes for the DVD generation.",Fresh
[Polanski] takes the Dickens that screenwriter Ronald Harwood has faithfully transcribed and doesn't so much bring it to life as turn it into a handsomely mounted still life,Rotten
Kingsley's Fagin takes us on a fantastic joyride through the sleazy and disease-ridden 19th century London tenderloin and leaves everybody smiling in the end.,Fresh
"Like a Classics Comic Book adaptation of the story--tasteful, subdued and just a bit dull.",Rotten
"Roman Polanski has made some classic films over the years, but this is not one of them.",Rotten
"Oliver Twist is a rarity, as far as Polanski films go, in that it is just an OK movie.",Rotten
Polanski has given the Dickens saga a thrilling epic look.,Fresh
Roman Polanski has made a perfectly agreeable and entertaining new Oliver Twist.,Fresh
"Perhaps it will take a school trip to encourage kids to see Oliver Twist, but that's one permission slip parents should sign.",Fresh
"Seeing Polanski's version of this most Dickensian of all Charles Dickens' tales, I felt full and wanted no more versions (please, sir!), having now seen the definitive one.",Fresh
The film is high on production values but short on heart.,Rotten
Polanski's Oliver Twist is craftsmanly and relatively unsentimental.,Rotten
"While (David) Lean's '48 Twist remains definitive, Polanski offers today's filmgoers a version nearly as rich and evocative.",Fresh
Roman Polanski's new version finds the humor in Dickens' story without glossing over the essential point that a society must be judged inhumane if its treatment of its most unfortunate members is not humane.,Fresh
Polanski's Twist is a serious and credible movie with a great many virtues -- gorgeous cinematography and an activist zeal chief among them -- but it's something you watch rather than lose yourself in.,Rotten
Polanski's film is visually exact and detailed without being too picturesque.,Fresh
"Polanski and company have proven that, once again, great stories never go out of style.",Fresh
When was the last time you walked out of a Polanski picture talking mostly about the sets and music?,Rotten
A fifth-grade puppet show of Oliver Twist would have been more watchable. And far less sickening.,Rotten
"...one of Polanski's safest, least distinctive pictures -- just another tasteful run through a story that's already too familiar. Oh well, at least in this one nobody sings.",Rotten
"It's noble, high-minded and safe, and I can't help thinking that I would have preferred an audacious but honest failure.",Rotten
"Great expectations are unavoidable when Roman Polanski takes on a Charles Dickens classic. Alas, his version of Oliver Twist fails to live up to them.",Rotten
A grounded and unusually matter-of-fact adaptation.,Fresh
"Oliver Twist has been done repeatedly on film and TV, but never better than in Roman Polanski's beautiful and tough-minded movie.",Fresh
"Engaging, handsomely photographed and beautifully acted, Polanski's Oliver Twist, adapted by Pianist screenwriter Ronald Harwood, distinguishes itself from most versions in its decidedly dark tone.",Fresh
"Poignant and primal, Roman Polanski's splendid adaptation of the Charles Dickens classic pricks the heart and the conscience.",Fresh
"As family fare goes, this makes The Corpse Bride look like Chicken Little.",Rotten
"In Oliver Twist, it's the viewer who is punished.",Rotten
"A movie that's beautifully acted, with an eye for drab period detail.",Fresh
"Beauty and hateful ugliness meet in extraordinary harmony in Roman Polanski's Oliver Twist, fitting for a story that is a study in obvious contrasts.",Fresh
"Oliver Twist is a lovely, tony picture, but it isn't exactly essential.",Fresh
"Nitpickers may squawk over missing elements, but the film doggedly hits on the book's big themes: the power of innocence, the cruelty of class.",Fresh
The question of why anyone would bother to make another film version of `Oliver Twist' is not answered by director Roman Polanski.,Rotten
Dickens' continuing relevance is less a testament to his genius than to the endurance and recurrence of the problems he took as his focus.,Rotten
"Oliver Twist as presented by Roman Polanski is pretty much the same as Oliver Twist presented by anyone else, except perhaps it's a bit duller.",Rotten
"As handsomely made, well-acted, dramatically unflinching and heartfelt as it is, Polanski's Oliver is a movie more admirable than emotionally affecting.",Fresh
"With the story lines streamlined and compressed, the whole thing doesn't have nearly the emotional heft it probably should.",Rotten
"Polanski's Oliver proves surprisingly uninspired, taking nearly the entire movie before it belatedly springs to life.",Rotten
"Polanski could have made Oliver as haunting as his 2002 Academy Award-winning film, The Pianist. Yet his new effort falls just short.",Rotten
"The film is worth seeing, but it won't hold a cherished place in your moviegoing memories.",Fresh
"Hopefully, this loving adaptation will allow a new generation to discover this masterpiece.",Fresh
It's as though Polanski had set the story's foolproof motor on cruise control and left the room; the tale is well told but told without personality.,Rotten
"Please sir, can I have some more... levity with my poverty and abject misery. This bleak story could benefit from some musical numbers to break up the monotony of sorrow.",Rotten
A film that's stately in its production but moves as if walking through thick gruel.,Rotten
Yet given previous versions... there ought to be something new here to warrant retelling. There isn't.,Rotten
"... a relatively gentle, even sweet film",Fresh
Enjoyable but not remarkable filmmaking.,Fresh
"Technically sound and surprisingly faithful to its source material, Roman Polanski's version of Oliver Twist comes across as uninspired and flat.",Rotten
While the picture is not quite a masterpiece it does carry the stamp of a master filmmaker working at the height of his abilities.,Fresh
'Oliver Twist' proves what 'The Pianist' only hinted at-that Roman Polanski is the world's most talented paint-by-numbers artist.,Rotten
"Is it worth renting the video sometime in the spring so the little darlings can cheat on their book report? Perhaps, as it's unusually faithful to the original source.",Fresh
Polanski presents a good but not great rendering of Dickens' oft-filmed second novel.,Fresh
"Where the movie should hurt with an establishment built on dehumanization, it's stagy and inert.",Rotten
"Plods along with the dutiful, near-reverent air of an annual Christmas sermon.",Rotten
"While Roman Polanski's latest version of Oliver doesn't make any bold new twists, it follows the recipe with great care and features several great performances.",Fresh
"Ben Kingsley finally recaptures his dignity after the trifecta of awfulness that was Thunderbirds, Suspect Zero, and A Sound of Thunder.",Fresh
"Dickens was a better social chronicler than storyteller, and Polanski has chosen to adopt that weakness in the interests of utter faithfulness to the text.",Rotten
"Okay, I get it. Polanski doesn't want us to forget his childhood.",Fresh
"The strength of the Polanski film is its lack of sentimentality. He creates a cold, cruel world where an orphan boy, because of his station in life, has no future.",Fresh
Polanski does what he can with source material that is larger than life.,Fresh
"The sad thing is that this really is a very fine film. Yet, at the end of the day, it's still Oliver Twist.",Fresh
It retains the book's emotional punch and darker elements - the spectre of the gallows is a running motif - and presents them in a way likely to engage younger viewers without patronising them.,Fresh
Polanski is the perfect director for the project.,Fresh
"No one said ""I want some more, sir,"" when it comes to film adaptations of the Charles Dickens classic.",Rotten
"Why, oh why, wasn't this movie released at Christmas time?",Fresh
"Doesn't shy away from the text's alarming elements. They are instead put to good use, adding shadow and texture to the lively, plot-driven story.",Fresh
"Please sir, can we have some less?",Rotten
"As much as I'm loath to say it, this is one literary adaptation where I can sadly say with certainty I do not want more.",Rotten
"There's also strong support from Harry Eden, as well as Leanne Rowe as the archetypal tart-with-a-heart Nancy, whilst Jamie Foreman (nasty pieces of work a specialty) adds another great performance to his rogue's gallery of Cockney villains.",Fresh
"It's not Dickens and it's not David Lean, either. This perverse retelling of a classic could only be the work of one filmmaker that I can think of. It's my boy Polanski.",Fresh
Polanski tactfully stays out of Charles Dickens' way.,Fresh
"Despite the length, you'll never fault the film's craftsmanship.",Fresh
Polanski's deft adaptation proves that there's still life in that well-worn story of a boy who beats the odds.,Fresh
(Roman) Polanski orchestrates this well-worn chestnut with the same high level of expertise that won him an Oscar for The Pianist in 2002.,Fresh
"""Oliver Twist"" deserves to be recognized as one of the director's better films.",Fresh
"It's an impeccable production on a visual level and undeniably a well-made film, but the narrative often lacks the spark to bring it to life.",Rotten
"Falha ao jamais encontrar um tom adequado para sua narrativa: em certos momentos,  excessivamente infantil; em outros, sombrio demais.",Rotten
"...respectful without being slavish, nice to look at without ever being breathtaking, well cast and acted without ever deeply engaging our emotions.",Fresh
[T]he maddening thing is not just that we hardly need another movie adaptation of [Oliver Twist] ... but that there are other Dickens books that haven't been given the major movie treatment that would better suit Polanski's temperament.,Rotten
"A severely overlooked, exceedingly well-done version of an oft-told tale...One of the best films of 2005.",Fresh
It just might supplant David Lean's 1948 version as the one that students turn to for a 2-hour study guide.,Fresh
"The movie understands what Polanski himself knew upon surviving the Holocaust--you take your kindness where you can find it, weighing its price along the way.",Fresh
"With intelligence and style (inspired by the art of Gustave Dor and Francisco Sol), Polanski makes a rewarding contribution to Dickens' legacy on screen.",Fresh
"It's a respectful and respectable version of the story, albeit just a wee bit overlong.",Fresh
"Probably the thing that Polanski's Oliver Twist does best, is deliver the mood of the day",Fresh
"Polanski's film is not a bad adaptation, and it may be a fine way to introduce children to the classic story. But it is not exactly a definitive version of that story.",Fresh
The unspoken sense of youthful post-traumatic holocaust syndrome shock and awe in Polanski's Twist is as palpable as the murky stench and appalling human misery of Dickens' chaotic London streets.,Fresh
"Polanski has crafted something that already feels like a classic film, beautiful to look at, combining accurate period detail with a certain gothic expressionism and brimming with earthy characters and high drama.",Fresh
The horrors are comfily buttressed by storybook polish,Fresh
Oliver Twist is an affecting and refreshing adaptation of Dickens seminal work from a master director.,Fresh
"A smorgasbord of urban decay, social disorder, and class conflict imbues the film with a potent sensuality",Fresh
Certainly Polanski deserves our gratitude for obliging the cast not to sink their teeth too deep into Dickens' juicy dialogue.,Fresh
"Polanski and Harwood have streamlined the meandering narrative to Dickens' second novel, which may horrify purists, but which works well enough for the filmmakers' purposes.",Fresh
"Polanski's Oliver Twist is a flawed but harrowing, empathetic view of the world seen through the eyes of its most powerless and invisible citizens.",Fresh
The Alamo is an engaging and spectacular tribute to the power of filmmaking - both as socio-historic document and as a flashlight into the hearts of its participants.,Fresh
"There's a lot of talky drama and it takes more than two hours before you get to the fighting, but it remains an American epic.",Fresh
"Could Wayne have crafted a better film if he only tried his hand at directing, instead of putting on the hero's mantle as well? Doubtful.",Rotten
"Wildly overwrought, clumsy, and embarassingly directed.",Rotten
"John Wayne doesn't appear for the first twenty minutes of The Alamo, his 1960 directorial debut, and that's a bad sign.",Rotten
"Duke does Alamo redux. Heroic, overblown, speechy.",Fresh
"As his own producer and director, Mr. Wayne has unfortunately let his desire to make a ""big"" picture burden him with dialogue. His action scenes are usually vivid, his talk scenes are long and usually dull.",Rotten
Patriotic but inaccurate epic Western.,Fresh
"An elephantine, historically inaccurate, stridently patriotic tribute to the handful of Texans who faced assault by 7,000 Mexican baddies.",Rotten
"Despite a banal and preachy script, full of speeches about religion and patriotism,the film has some good action sequences; overall, it's not worse than the 2004 remake starring Billy Bob Thornton.",Fresh
"In spite of the painstaking attempts to explore the characters of the picture's three principal heroes (Bowie, Crockett, Travis), there is an absence of emotional feeling, of a sense of participation.",Rotten
"All the pontificating about the joys of freedom becomes irritating, but James Edward Grant's dialogue occasionally crackles with enough humorous wit to hold an audience untill the gripping finale.",Fresh
Interminable.,Rotten
"The film is sometimes too gabby and too sentimental but is magnificent to look at, and the inexorable climax is awesome in its scope and fury.",Fresh
"[It] would be a fascinating exercise -- both artistic and anthropological -- if one word of G were authentic, artful or even borderline believable.",Rotten
"The producers may be right to bemoan Hollywood's myopia; but it's the movie's execution, not its vision of an alternative African-American cinema, that delayed its release.",Rotten
The decadent world of Hamptonite hip-hop moguls is a fitting backdrop for this somewhat faithful but not very graceful retelling of F. Scott Fitzgerald's 'Great Gatsby.',Rotten
"The filmmakers are going for something operatic here with their mix of love and loss, rap and race. They miss. By a lot.",Rotten
Fails both as an update of F. Scott Fitzgerald's dissection of American aspirations and class barriers and on its own boorish terms.,Rotten
"The problem with G is not merely that the ending doesn't work and feels hopelessly contrived. It's also that the plot adds too many unnecessary characters and subplots, so that the main line gets misplaced.",Rotten
"In nimbly sidestepping the burden of textual fidelity, director Christopher Scott Cherot's freeform Fitzgerald riff captures the novel's sense of unrequited yearning better than any of Hollywood's more slavishly faithful attempts.",Fresh
props for being more ambitious than the average contemporary black romantic drama.,Fresh
An unpolished but entertaining tragedy filled with outstanding performances and memorable moments.,Fresh
"You should never make a movie about boundless, conspicuous wealth on an indie budget.",Rotten
"We beat on, boats against the current, borne back ceaselessly into the sha-fizzle-dizzle.",Rotten
"[A] poorly acted, directed and written (but slick-looking) vanity project.",Rotten
Bottom line: It works even if you've never heard of F. Scott Fitzgerald. But it's twice as much fun if you have.,Fresh
"The women are shrewishly materialistic, the men are manipulative or violent and the Polo wardrobes look fabulous on everyone. It's an ugly affair overall, but at least you can say you've never seen such beautiful shirts.",Rotten
"The book was about class and the American dream. The movie is too, though it's most interested in the soap opera machinations of the plot.",Rotten
"Everyone in this movie is getting it on with someone else behind their lover's back, but only the women have to end up suffering for it. Nice, right?",Rotten
"Christopher Scott Cherot's drama is an honorable attempt laid low by a verbose script, cheap production values, and a general tendency toward soap opera.",Rotten
"There is scarcely a minute's worth of believable human behavior on display in G, which builds to a climax as incoherent as it is ludicrous.",Rotten
"G often resembles a glossy BET soap opera...Cherot does capture the decadence of its slick ""playas"" in the extravagant world of bling-worshipping music moguls",Fresh
"I still thought there were enough good performances, great visuals, and an interesting examination of a lifestyle in a way that we haven't seen a lot of times in movies for me to recommend it.",Fresh
No green light but the one mistakenly given to start production.,Rotten
Reworking the story with a hip-hop record mogul at its center comes across as little more than a stunt. And not a very good stunt.,Rotten
"Another strikeout, further destroying F. Scott Fitzgerald's film batting average.",Rotten
"The F. Scott Fitzgerald's classic, The Great Gatsby, adapted as a modern-day morality play in blackface. This fairly-faithful version explores the same themes as its source material, only with a hip-hop spin.",Fresh
"""G"" is a vacuous movie set in attractive locations.",Rotten
a colossal bore,Rotten
would work better as a stage play for high school theatrical productions,Rotten

"It might be a literate epic, but it's a long and heavy slog.",Rotten
The most notable battle on view in this picture isn't any of the skirmishes between Alexander's army and the opposing forces but the effort between Burton's blonde wig and March's shaggy beard to upstage each other in grievous grooming.,Rotten
"Overlong, over-written, and over-wigged, writer/director/producer Robert Rossen's Alexander The Great (1956) is a shining example of a lesser classical Hollywood historical epic.",Rotten
"The question the film asks is, ""Why not?"" Surely life is to be enjoyed? The answer is grimmer than you expect.",Fresh
A minor British classic and a valuable record of the hedonistic Swinging 60s.,Fresh
"The real strength, and the reason to see it, is the great performances from everyone involved.",Fresh
Essential 60s Michael Caine.,Fresh
Caine's terrific performance makes a viewer almost forget that the film is actually a condemnation of its character's swinging lifestyle.,Fresh
"Interestingly, the film's first person narration inclines us to relate to and identify with the protagonist, and for much of the film you like the man despite his faults.",Fresh
"Caine does a wonderful job of building and maintaining sympathy for his arrant, arrogant character, despite his obvious brutishness.",Fresh
"It put Michael Caine on the movie star map, deservedly so.",Fresh
a sober-minded study of one man's inability to settle down...,Fresh
Caine does such a flawless job in the role that he alone makes the film.,Fresh
Michael Caine's breakout performance is awesome.,Fresh
"Of course he gets his comeuppance, in an ending that has all the moral weight and sincerity of a DeMille sex'n'sawdust spectacular. Good performances, though.",Fresh
"Michael Caine gives a bravura, career-making and Oscar-nominated, performance as a Cockney Don Juan, who's by turns weak and endearing, charming and despicable, but the film has aged badly.",Fresh
"What makes it work is charismatic Caine and the witty, intelligent script. Both work together to keep this remorseless bastard who uses and hurts women from being completely unlikable or unsympathetic.",Fresh
"Behind its alley-cat philosophy, there's some shrewd sense, some pointed barbs and a sharp moral.",Fresh
"Alfie (Michael Caine) is more than just a perpetual bachelor; he's a ladies' man, a cad, a man about town. Put bluntly: Alfie loves to have sex. He meets women and takes what he wants from them: pleasure. But behind him, Alfie is leaving a trail of misery",Fresh
Caine plays the sodding little spiv with a raucous charm that makes Alfie seem more interesting than he actually is.,Fresh
"In its time, the film was praised for its sexual frankness and persuasive rendering of Swinging London; both seem quaint by contemporary standards. Caine's Cockney Don Juan, however, is sui generis.",Fresh
"For all its implicit misogyny, the original 1966 film version of Bill Naughton's play remains durable because of Michael Caine's career-defining performance as the cockney ladies' man.",Fresh
"An amusing, moving and meaningful picture. Although for much of the way it tinkles along with the innocent merriment of a carousel, it dips into reality for its climax, and makes a valid and indelible impression.",Fresh
In Lewis Gilbert's film the stop-go policy of laugh-cry-laugh-cry (with squeal-titter variations now and then) just doesn't work because the moods overlap.,Rotten

"Good actors are wasted, sets dominate storytelling, and it's all based on the most banal and artificial of children's tales. Avoid.",Rotten

Writer/ director Joshua Michael Stern has crafted something more than a mess and something less than a film that hits home. Neverwas never does quite win us over.,Rotten
Never has so much talent come to so little because of a screenplay that's so adrift and aimless. Eckhart plays a psychologist with enough personal psychoses to keep himself preoccupied for a lifetime.,Rotten
"At a time when most films lack subtlety, it is rare to find one as delicate, wistful and tender as 'Neverwas.'",Fresh
... a sincerely (if not exactly subtly) performed spiritual drama with a faith-based lesson in humility and the practical charity of offering a helping hand.,Rotten
"Startlingly direct, if unavoidably preachy, The Second Chance takes aim at Christianity's racial divide and the corporatization of faith.",Fresh
"Sure, there are lots of positive messages about following your calling and seeing how others live, but that message would better resonate with the audience if the story wasn't so bland.",Rotten
"There are a lot of good messages in The Second Chance about how Christianity is a mix of love, both gentle and tough.",Fresh
"It is earnest, cliched, often awkward and unlikely to inspire anyone who isn't already thoroughly sold on its message of salvation through community activism.",Rotten
"[The film is] designed to launch Christian pop singer Michael W. Smith as a movie brand name. It doesn't really succeed at that, but it does manage to send a positive message in a pretty polished movie, a message aimed at regular church-goers.",Rotten
"[The film is] sabotaged by hackneyed dialogue, sluggish pacing and a listless performance by Smith, who only springs to life when he's singing.",Rotten
"A movie-of-the-week treatment of race and class, the film credibly portrays the day-to-day workings of an urban ministry.",Fresh
It's not the message that bothered me but the obvious way in which it's delivered.,Rotten
Second Chance delivers its parable of spiritual growth with enough tender nuance that it doesn't merely preach to the choir.,Fresh
"As divided as the two very different churches at its center, The Second Chance reps an uneasy marriage of spiritual conviction and dramatic expedience.",Rotten
"This may be a church movie, but it's one of the better ones.",Fresh
"A modern morality play whose positive messages are undercut by its pandering, paternalistic tone.",Rotten
The end result is that rare Christian film that garners a PG-13 rating for its realistic portrayals of violence and conflict.,Fresh
"With no common language, these two connect instantly -- perhaps it's the blood -- and embark on an emotionally wrenching journey in this visually appealing, occasionally heavy-handed thriller from Paula van der Oest.",Fresh

"The situation compels you to keep watching, only to be disappointed when you realize the story's not going anywhere.",Rotten

A pretty daring -- and disconcerting -- depiction of adolescent sexuality.,Fresh
Moonlight is a disturbing and daring thriller with an exceptional performance by 13-year-old Laurien Van den Broeck.,Fresh
"A wild dream that spins into a nightmare, Moonlight isn't quite as provocative as it aims to be.",Rotten

The most instense and satisfying piece of science fiction ever made. James Cameron's masterpiece.,Fresh
"What happens when you take a premise, soak it in a combination of adrenaline and kerosene, then light the sucker.",Fresh
"Aliens never strives to be as accomplished as the original, but it's wit and turbo-charged battles make it a wild and electric ride, one with the best replay value of the franchise.",Fresh
[A] modern sci-fi classic.,Fresh
The Director's Cut of the film hauntingly amplifies Ripley's disconnect from her dead daughter and her relationship to the young Newt.,Fresh
Aliens ends up as a wild and woolly roller-coaster ride of a movie which should attract anxious crowds of thrill fans as it cuts a swath through theaters from here to Alpha Centauri.,Fresh

It's actually scary to think about what the movie landscape would look like had Aliens not been the critical and commercial success that it was.,Fresh

"The trouble Ripley has found this time is exponentially bigger and scarier than anything she encountered in Ridley Scott's memorably minimalist, eerily elegant 1979 film.",Fresh
"Some critics consider this chapter to be better than the first, but the two movies are vastly different: Ridley Scott's is a scary horror film, whereas James Cameron's is a high-tech actioner with superlative set-pieces.",Fresh
If you were to only see one movie in your entire lifetime it would have to be ALIENS. James Cameron has delivered a masterpiece that will never in a million years be topped...,Fresh
"Proved that James Cameron has a mind for directing action movies considerably more nuanced and plot-driven than just ""find ways to blow things up"".",Fresh
"It's interesting that the film, a sequel to Ridley Scott's 1979 atmospheric horror-film-in-space, is generally regarded as an action movie. Go through it, and you'll realize the character and dialogue scenes far outweigh the kablooey stuff.",Fresh
"Alien sequel is bigger, faster, scarier.",Fresh
"James Cameron's Aliens is easily one of the best sequels ever made, taking the original story and expanding upon it in ways most sequels are afraid to do.",Fresh
Aliens contains a fascinating exploration of the way Western culture has traditionally aligned feminine characteristics onto nature while masculine characteristics have been aligned with civilisation.,Fresh
Another defining picture in the sci-fi genre. A stellar achievement that's almost as good as the original.,Fresh
Count me out of the fan club for this one.,Rotten
"On the short list of sequels that not only matched the quality of its predecessor, but arguably surpassed it to become one of the greatest films of its genre.",Fresh
[Aliens] is a spectacular example of state-of-the-art science fiction simply because it never tries to be overtly spectacular.,Fresh
"It's blaster action, not Gothic future-horror. Fortunately, director-screenwriter James Cameron has shaped his film around the defiant intelligence and sensual athleticism of Weaver, and that's where Aliens works best.",Fresh
"The idea behind Aliens remains the scariest, dirtiest, most perversely funny one for a monster film, and the Rambo action further gooses us.",Fresh
"The result is a film that not only answers many questions raised by the original story, but also expands production values, amplifies special effects and weaves a new plot that is even more exciting than the first.",Fresh
This film is also the best monster movie of the year and the best picture of any kind to open so far this summer. Put it another way: Aliens is the Jaws of the '80s.,Fresh
"Surpassing its predecessor in terms of sheer spectacle, this sequel to Ridley Scott's outer-space nightmare from director James Cameron is an outstanding science-fiction thriller.",Fresh

"Action thrillers assail but rarely test us; this is the tautest, most provoking, and altogether most draining example ever made.",Fresh
"The first of these movies remains one of the great sci-fi horror achievements of the modern cinema, but its sequel, ""Aliens,"" is that rare instance where a follow-up deviates from the formula and finds an effective rhythm in propelling the story",Fresh
"Scene to scene, encounter to encounter, its tension builds unrelentingly. So, fasten your seat belts. It`s a blast.",Fresh
"A subtle, spooky movie with teeth becomes a subtlety-bashing war movie.",Fresh
Much more high energy but just as sophisticated as the original...,Fresh
"An excellent science fiction, horror, action AND war film.",Fresh
"Cameron's film is a lot of fun for what it is, a bonanza of brash action sequences and delicious camaraderie. It proves beyond a shadow of a doubt that while nobody can hear you scream in space, they can certainly hear you shoot.",Fresh
"The whole finale is white-knuckled, some of the best aciton and suspense film-making I've ever seen.",Fresh
"Beyond dispute, however, is the film's timeless worth as a cathartic work, especially in terms of its accidentally commentary on the sexism of the corporate structure.",Fresh
"Under [James] Cameron's care, Aliens emerges as that rarest of sequels that, if not surpassing its predecessor, stands comfortably alongside it as an equal.",Fresh
"It's so rare to see a sequel live up and maybe surpass (depending on if you like your horror with plenty of action or not) the original, but Aliens does...",Fresh
"Sigourney Weaver is merely terrific... When she straps on her armament to do battle with the aliens, she makes Sylvester Stallone look like a pipsqueak.",Fresh
"(Sigourney) Weaver proves to be a formidable action hero.. One of just a few females in a film filled with aggro males, she doesn't just hold her own, she owns the movie.",Fresh
"At any rate, it's an exciting and well-made film, inspires great conversations, and presents some of the most appealing women characters in the movies.",Fresh
"Eschewing the claustrophobic foreboding of Alien, Cameron takes all the anxieties and fears that had been built in the original and refracts it through his action movie sensibilities to create a smart action thriller.",Fresh

"[Director] Gutierrez sustains a heightened mood of sex and violence that, without breaking new ground, entertains in the way Gothic flicks do: a combination of cheap thrills and a good old-fashioned crusade against evil.",Fresh
"You can thank a capable cast led by the estimable Lucy Liu, and work by writer/director Sebastian Gutierrez that succeeds in making the formulaic seem fresh.",Fresh
"There are worse things than waking up in a morgue. Like, say, waking up and realizing there's another hour of Rise: Blood Hunter to go.",Rotten
"I wasn't expecting much from director/writer Sebastian Gutierrez, considering his last writing effort was the dismal ""Snakes on a Plane."" But in ""Rise: Blood Hunter"" he offers absolutely nothing new in terms of vampire stories if not a lush noirish atmosp",Rotten
"Mix Blade, a dash of Point Blank, and one of the worst movies you could imagine, and that's pretty close to capturing the experience of viewing Rise: Blood Hunter.",Rotten
"Rise is middling, but not by doing things the wrong way. It's not wild enough.",Rotten
"A dry and dreary little affair, one that's almost shamefully beholden to B-flicks that are a lot more energetic and a lot less intent on being taken so seriously.",Rotten
"It's a blood-red affair thrown together in a dash, a little number that will ultimately get the same kind of treatment from audiences as it did from those who made it: something you might cue up in the DVD player on a whim and forget just as easily.",Rotten
...a far more effective piece of work than one might've expected...,Fresh
"far from perfect, but it's better than most direct-to-video horror you'll find out there. Heck, it's better than some of the theatrical releases we've seen this year",Fresh
"While Rise: Blood Hunter isn't a terrible film, it's a predictable one.",Rotten
"A tedious Blade rip-off. No suspense or scares, but lots of boredom.",Rotten
Torturous vampire bloodbath is a waste for all.,Rotten
"Lucy Liu is always welcome on my screen, an actress who marries intelligence with feminine mystique, bundled with a dry wit and the ability to make action roles credible.",Fresh
"All About Eve (1950), is a realistic, dramatic depiction of show business and backstage life of Broadway and the New York theater. The devastating debunking of stage and theatrical characters was...",Fresh
The film is filled with a nice dark humor that is rare for the I-Like-Ike decade of filmmaking.,Fresh
All About Eve is a film that you see completely differently once you know what's going to happen.,Fresh
"[Bette Davis'] veteran actress Margo Channing in ""All About Eve"" (1950) was her greatest role.",Fresh
"While its attitudes toward women are dated, its wit and perceptiveness are as fresh today as they were in 1950.",Fresh
"The screenplay... may be the most biting example of hard-boiled wit ever to come out of Hollywood, and it is stylishly performed at a breakneck pace by a uniformly expert cast.",Fresh
No other movie makes being smart and cynical look like more fun.,Fresh
It's about the glory of acting.,Fresh
"With dialogue so crisp and poisonous, it makes you wonder where script-driven movies have gone.",Fresh
"The presence of All About Eve, while a relief, is also a sad reminder of how in certain ways movies have regressed in the past 50 years.",Fresh
"It is, unquestionably, one of America's proudest moments, and before you line up for tickets to the new Adam Sandler vehicle, you may want to remind yourself of what movies used to be able to accomplish.",Fresh
Mankiewicz's 1950 gem is a wickedly cynical cocktail of laughter and deceit in which everyone has an angle to play.,Fresh
"Is there anyone alive who hasn't seen All About Eve -- anyone who doesn't love movies, that is?",Fresh
One of the best send-ups of the inside back-stabbing and infighting that goes on in Hollywood ever put to film.,Fresh
Boffo look at the backstabbing backstage world of Broadway,Fresh

"A motion picture that, because of its priceless dialogue and unforgettable lead performance, will never lose its luster.",Fresh
"In spite of the employ of melodramatic tropes such as shifting alliances and power-play seductions, the heart of the film is a woman's fear of aging.",Fresh
"A fine Darryl Zanuck production, excellent music and an air of ultra-class complete this superior satire. The legitimate theatre had better look to its laurels.",Fresh
Mankiewicz's flair for dialog is so perfected that all three actresses shoot fireworks whenever they open their mouths.,Fresh
Outstanding Mankiewicz film with the perfect cast.,Fresh
"Poucos roteiros, em toda a Histria do Cinema, conseguiram reunir tantos dilogos memorveis.",Fresh
"Bette Davis renders her most memorable performance as declining diva Margo Channing in one of Hollywood's wittiest satires of the Broadway theater, but, alas, she was deprived of getting the Oscar.",Fresh
"Forget Foreman vs. Ali, this is Baxter vs. Davis in one of Hollywood's greatest showdowns.",Fresh
Amazing performances top the list of positive qualities in Joseph L Mankiewicz' All About Eve.,Fresh
"The hoped-for tone of Restoration comedy never quite materializes, perhaps because Mankiewicz's cynicism is only skin-deep, but the film's tinny brilliance still pleases.",Fresh
Intelligent script ... mesmerizing performances,Fresh
Still retains its stagy power to provoke theater lovers by its elaborate wit and campy bad taste.,Fresh
[Features] more quotable dialogue in one movie than most screenwriters manage in a lifetime.,Fresh
"There is so much to admire in All About Eve, even for those too young to be drenched in nostalgia for the spectacle of Bette Davis unleashing her sharp tongue.",Fresh
"Apart from the monochrome photography, all that dates the film is the chain-smoking and the fact that these are theatre folk rather than movie stars (frequent in-jokes about the low art of Hollywood pepper the script).",Fresh
"For old-school Hollywood movie-making at its most polished, literate and sophisticated there is really nothing to match it.",Fresh
"Put simply, one of the greatest movies ever made.",Fresh
"The peerless tale of two rival drama queens, playing as the central attraction in the BFI Southbank's Joseph L Mankiewicz season, and rightly so.",Fresh
"Here is a real Christmas treat: a restored version of Joseph L Mankiewicz's jet-black 1950 comedy about Margo Channing, elegant leading lady of the theatre, superbly played by Bette Davis.",Fresh
A total joy.,Fresh
One of Hollywood's finest backstage dramas. If nothing else Davis should have been rewarded for services to the tobacco industry.,Fresh
"Joseph L Mankiewicz's wonderfully literate 1950 classic drama of the theatrical life, All About Eve, is back in the cinema, to be savoured for its language, performances, psychological insights and proof that all the world's a stage.",Fresh
The Zanuck production investiture is +h in every department.,Fresh
"It crackles with smart, smarting dialogue.",Fresh
Sanders...was ideally cast in this role: you can feel in Addison's every word the world-weariness of the actor who would eventually commit suicide at age 65...,Fresh
Classic movie about an ambitious woman.,Fresh
"Along with films such as Luis Buuel's ""Los Olvidados"" and Billy Wilder's ""Sunset Boulevard,"" Joseph Mankiewicz's ""All About Eve"" made 1950 one of the most seminal years in cinema history.",Fresh
All About Eve looks into Broadway's artichoke heart to ring an early death knell for classic Hollywood.,Fresh
"In our celebrity-obsessed culture, it's possible that All About Eve is more important than ever. Scratch that. How about it's more entertaining than ever?",Fresh
Mankiewicz's inside knowledge of show business and its particular personality types gives the film an authenticity and allows for its famously devastating acid wit. [Blu-ray],Fresh
What makes the picture seem so good (what makes it eminently worth seeing) is the satirical touches in its detail and the performance of Bette Davis.,Fresh
Bette Davis is fabulous in this role.,Fresh
"Screenwriting students, you have your Bible. Movie lovers, you have a film that is impervious to the rigors of time, not to mention an inspiration for every prime-time soap opera.",Fresh
All About Eve is deliciously fun to watch with characters playing versions of themselves (most noticeably Bette Davis) and being quite introspective for its day.,Fresh
"Joseph Mankiewicz was Hollywood's midcentury master of comic drama, and All About Eve, from 1950, was one of his signal achievements.",Fresh
"A classic movie, whose qualities remind us that there once was a Hollywood where such sophisticated treats could be made.",Fresh
"All About Eve is not only a brilliant and clever portrait of an actress, it is a downright funny film, from its opening scene to the final fadeout.",Fresh
"Joseph L. Mankiewicz' All About Eve is a rich, impeccably written, gunshot sharp black comedy about an aging actress, the go-getter who seeks to supplant her, and the heaping pile of carefully fostered artisanal bitchiness that they construct.",Fresh
"Joseph L Mankiewicz's film dissects the narcissism and hypocrisy of the spotlight as sharply as [Billy Wilder's Sunset Blvd], but pays equal attention to the challenges of enacting womanhood.",Fresh
"As if Bette Davis wasn't enough, the supporting cast is also fantastically emotive.",Fresh
One of the greatest films of post-WWII Hollywood.,Fresh
"Bette Davis is most certainly at the top of her game playing the crowd favourite Margo Channing,...",Fresh
"It is similar to a good many films that have gone before it, but Joseph L. Mankiewicz, who wrote and directed the picture, has been so ingenious in his treatment of the subject that he has come up with a thoroughly entertaining movie.",Fresh
"All About Eve ranks among the smartest comedy-dramas in many, many years.",Fresh
"...a wise, witty, lusty and adult comedydrama which has to do with intrigue and doubledealing in the world of the Broadway theatre.",Fresh
"n a movie in which everyone is preoccupied with learning all about her character, she remains alluringly, dangerously unknowable.",Fresh
"Writer-director Joseph L. Mankiewicz's enduring masterpiece -- and, incidentally, my all-time favorite film.",Fresh
"a smart, insightful, and darkly humorous drama about the intersections of art and show business and that insatiable appetite we call ambition",Fresh
Screen gems have been rare of late but All About Eve... puts things back in balance,Fresh
"I'm full of praise for the penetrating characterisations, the scathing satire, the bright dialogue, the spiked humor.",Fresh
"In the role of the elder actress, Bette Davis plays with a brilliance that not only is the best acting she has shown us, but just about the best that has been done on the screen.",Fresh
"Never has a film, both in story and in technique, been brought more closely to the stage than All About Eve... Its appeal and its success depend almost entirely on gesture and conversation.",Fresh
All About Eve is in essence a play fabricated into celluloid with absolutely no feeling for pictorial style or form.,Rotten
"Betty Davis gives the finest performance of her career. If there was ever any doubt in your mind that she was one of the greatest of screen actresses, her performance here will dissipate ail doubt.",Fresh
"Acridly cynical (realizing Addison's self-proclaimed contempt for humanity, coupled with insatiable ambition) and somewhat unpleasant, yet highly influential.",Fresh
The kind of dialogue actors kill for.,Fresh
"Making The Family Stone's shenanigans and schmaltz seem downright sophisticated by comparison, Salvador Litvak's Passover-themed film gives Jews an insufferable holiday family comedy to call their own.",Rotten
"Eat soaks up the passions, disagreements, and love the Seder inspires, with the writers capturing the utter chaos of a full dinner table.",Fresh
Unfunny Semitic caricatures. Even worse than 'My Big Fat Greek Wedding.',Rotten
"When Do We Eat? takes place before, during and after a Passover Seder. But you don't have to be Jewish to savor this light and enjoyable comedy.",Fresh
"When Do We Eat? may strike a chord with those struggling to reconcile traditional faith and modernity, though few are likely to buy Ira's post-high transformation into a loving husband and father.",Rotten
...genuinely funny.,Fresh
"In this distasteful film from Salvador Litvak, a Jewish family tries to race through a Seder, but drug use, possible incest and some jokes at the expense of the autistic slow them down.",Rotten
"Though the script never rises above sitcom-style one-liners and sight gags, strong performances invest both the jokes and the syrupy moments of forgiveness and reconciliation with no small measure of, yes, heart.",Fresh
"While it does have some sweet moments and a handful of zingy one-liners, the film all too often resembles a trite dinner theater play that's been minimally 'opened up' for the screen.",Rotten
"When Do We Eat? is as imperfect as the Stuckmans' Seder, yet it has some decent punchlines, a strong cast and a good heart.",Fresh
"Cliches and loud stereotypes as fresh as year-old matzoh infest When Do We Eat?, a farce about a wildly dysfunctional Los Angeles family's disastrous Passover Seder.",Rotten
"A self-consciously zany dysfunctional family comedy, When Do We Eat? strains so hard to be outrageous that it sacrifices characters for caricatures. They might have had something if they'd let everybody relax, be themselves and enjoy dinner.",Rotten
"When Do We Eat? is about as funny, emotionally satisfying and even spiritually significant as this type of thing gets.",Fresh
"If this is someone's idea of dinner and a movie, you might as well skip the movie.",Rotten
[Director] Litvak crams so many earth-shattering revelations and long-buried resentments into 93 minutes that the film feels as if it's struggling to provide something recognizable to every potential ticket buyer.,Rotten
"When Do We Eat? isn't a great film or, necessarily, a particularly good one, but it's a worthy attempt at making an entertaining movie about faith.",Fresh
Not recomended for the Goyim.,Rotten
Another entry in indiedom's contest to create the most dysfunctional family.,Rotten
It borders on painful to see this cast go through the motions of this uninspired script.,Rotten
Watching this movie is kind of like being sprayed with emotional vomit.,Rotten
But even the film's seeming singularity proves deceptive once it becomes apparent that When Do We Eat? is less a Passover movie than a Thanksgiving or Christmas movie dolled up in Jewish drag.,Rotten
"Even Jewish audiences will be hard-pressed to find something to enjoy in this highly stagy, claustrophobic depiction of a Seder populated by one wacky family that seems to include every stereotype in the book.",Rotten
"Its strong cast is loud and lively, and the bickering banter has snap and drive.",Fresh
A cute little Matzoh of a movie.,Fresh
"Crass, chaotic comedy.",Rotten
"The movie's most distinctive feature is its cast, which has the fake lived-in comfort of a TV clan.",Fresh
"Despite the fact that the meal served is kosher, the recipe is so hammy that the movie proves pretty indigestible.",Rotten
"Oh, what a distasteful film.",Rotten
... worth a look.,Fresh
A haunting and disturbing film.,Fresh
"This abrasive Passover comedy-drama is extremely difficult to sit through, and if its makers weren't all Jewish, it would be considered anti-Semitic.",Rotten
Litvak's movie almost immediately barges across the line separating the comically absurd from the outright obnoxious.,Rotten
"Thanks to a great cast and sharp writing, When Do We Eat? is a clever comedy with plenty of black humour and irreverence, all of which leads to contemplative thought.",Fresh
"Manages to be broad, mawkish and mean-spirited all at once.",Rotten
"even with all the strange impractical goings on, as with all in this recent string of popular entertainment culled from authentic orthodoxy, there are moments of sheer breathtaking joy that elevate the spirit of a Jew by speaking to their core.",Fresh
We're basically left with a wild-eyed group of actors who probably had a lot more fun shooting When Do We Eat? than they did watching it.,Rotten
"There's something very sweet and real beneath all the bluster, braggadocio, disgust and denial, pushing through as improbably and miraculously as Moses through the Red Sea.",Fresh
audiences both gay and straight should enjoy the comical and romantic hijinks.,Fresh
"[A] most unfabulous, unfunny, and unwatchable embarrassment.",Rotten
The Mostly Unfabulous Social Life of Then Green is another step back for the gay community.,Rotten
The mostly unfunny -- and unfabulous -- trifle never rises above sitcom level.,Rotten
"A frothy lark with a decided sense of the outrageous, sincere affection for its characters and their romantic plights.",Fresh
It's a dud.,Rotten
A bit like staring at a beauty queen's phonily tight smile for ninety minutes.,Rotten
"Remarkably true to its source: It's none too deep and a tad cartoonish, but also fast-paced, filled with quotable one-liners and often very funny.",Fresh
"This bright, fast-paced adaptation of Eric Orner's syndicated gay comic strip may not break any new cinematic ground, but its sharp, zingy wit and underlying sweetness deftly compensate for the occasional awkward patch or glaring narrative contrivance.",Fresh
"There's so much ill-conceived fluff floating about the 'elusive true love' themes that by the finish, Ethan Green hasn't as much substance as a good Looney Tunes.",Rotten
"Not un-entertaining, but director George Bamer's debut feature may play better on video.",Rotten
"Ethan Green may not exactly be fabulous, but it is pleasantly diverting.",Fresh
"'I'm 19, but I'm petulant' somehow sums it up.",Rotten
"With words streaming out of their mouths instead of into bubbles, Ethan and his gang of past, present and future lovers sound laughingly unbelievable.",Rotten
"No, he doesn't have anything terribly important, or even original to say, but he's funny, flighty and adorable, sort of like a gay Holly Golightly.",Fresh
The film's tone veers from misjudged sincerity to shrill sketch comedy of the broadest stripe.,Rotten
"In his directing debut, David Vernon, formerly a first assistant and second assistant director, opts for the look of a cable TV pilot.",Rotten
This feels like a school play that someone has dragged to film school and turned into a final project.,Rotten
"With its unpleasant characters, inconsistent script and awkward acting, what's not to hate?",Rotten
"The title does its own summing up: mostly, it's unfab.",Rotten
Tiresome romantic comedy that reinforces every imaginable gay stereotype.,Rotten
The drawings of Eric Orner's comic strip on which the movie is based are more animated than the actors who fail to give any dimension to their characters.,Rotten
George Bamber's film is bouncy and agreeable but has a certain flatness to it; never making the case for its existence as a movie rather than a comic strip.,Rotten
There's just not enough real heart to go along with the cutesiness.,Rotten
The Mostly Unfabulous Social Life of Ethan Green can't be accused of false advertising. This adaptation of the underground comic strip is mostly unfabulous.,Rotten
Lead characters who are completely unlikable fly right in the face of what most filmmakers think the audience wants. But I'll take that any day over a blandly nice character.,Fresh
"Writer David Vernon and director George Bamber have adroitly mined the best gags and one-liners from the strip, surrounded Ethan with a Dawson's Creek-quality supporting ensemble...",Fresh

"Chris Fisher's Dirty is clumsier and less earnest than Crash, but it's every bit as totalitarian.",Rotten
It is so biased that it doesn't inspire the outrage that Fisher obviously intended.,Rotten
A barely passable cop morality tale. But still passable.,Fresh
Another Cuba Gooding Jr. dud. Don't show him the money -- show him the door!,Rotten
[Director Fisher] appears fixated on Los Angeles as a nihilistic phantasmagoria.,Rotten
"At the end of the antiheroes' ropes, at the end of writer-director Chris Fisher's genre exercise, guns have been drawn, blood has been spilled, cops have been thwarted from going straight, and nothing has changed.",Rotten
"While I have no doubt that real corrupt cops use language like this, it sounds like these actors don't actually know what the words mean. They sound like eighth graders... like Anthony Anderson and Taye Diggs in Malibu's Most Wanted pretending not",Rotten
Cuba Gooding Jr. sheds the halo that has threated to strangle his career by playing a corrupt cop in a nasty little genre film set in Los Angeles.,Rotten
"It makes Training Day seem like a film about good citizenship, but Dirty is also a luxury vehicle for two actors whose every appearance on screen is a boon.",Fresh
"Like the best pulp, though, it gets its hooks into you faster than you can start to wonder why you should possibly care about what happens to any of its despicable characters, and, before you know it, you've been pulled deep into its Dantean vision.",Fresh
"The cinematography of Eliot Rockett is also laudable: The city is not only rendered in the usual hot and gritty texture of urban landscapes, but is imbued with sense of oppression that is palpable.",Fresh
Even the stunningly downbeat ending smacks of sub-Tarantinoesque theatrics.,Rotten
This isn't a film made by someone who knows anything about cops. It's a film made by someone who's seen a lot of cop movies.,Rotten
The machinations of the plot are so murky as to be not worth following.,Rotten
The only suspense is how long it's going to take for this movie to finally drag to an end.,Rotten
"As good as the leads and the supporting cast are, and as much action as gets packed into the film's relatively brief running time, none of it draws us in dramatically.",Rotten
"As the villain, Wyclef Jean exercises an impression-as-accent of John Malkovich's character from Rounders in turn impersonating a member of the Jamaican bobsled team.",Rotten
"Capturing LA as a sepia-toned, sunbaked wasteland just isn't fresh. Why must every LA cop drama take place on the hottest day of the year just as the city is about to explode?",Rotten
"The intentions are sincere, but you'll want to take a good shower after sitting through this mess.",Rotten
"DIRTY boasts about a wayward police drama that needs considerable conscientious washing. Sadly, this perfunctory scrub job simply attacks the same old neglected stained areas.",Rotten
"We get it. All of you guys watched the Tarantino movies and you watched the Peckinpah movies. Enough, give us something original.",Rotten
"...although Dirty isn't much better than some of his earlier efforts, one can't help but admire Gooding Jr's willingness to portray such an irredeemably nasty character.",Rotten
This picture of it is poppin' blanks at too many turns to be considered honest nor a reflection of the real deal.,Rotten
Fisher goes a bit too over the top with a couple of conventions that I wish he'd rein in.,Rotten
"Dirty is a solid ride, and deserves recognition if only because it affords Gooding the chance to reaffirm his acting chops.",Fresh
A no-nonsense dramatic response to the LAPD Rampart scandals of the '90s.,Fresh
This game is so over.,Rotten
A complete cinematic joke.,Rotten
"While the plot device is quite innovative, the execution remains pretty true to the PG-13 thriller formula.",Fresh
"The movie equivalent of junk food: It's not good, but it's predictable and even satisfying, in a low-expectations way.",Rotten
Dead on arrival.,Rotten
It's a test of endurance few will survive.,Rotten
What will terrify the audience very early on is the realization that there's better acting in the video game than on the big screen.,Rotten
It's amazing how little Stay Alive actually knows about the videogame culture in which its terror-lite tale is set.,Rotten
"Debuting director William Brent Bell, who wrote the script with producer Matthew Peterman, keeps the pace brisk and the pot bubbling.",Fresh
"Despite its title, this would-be thriller...is definitely D.O.A. Stay Alive? More to the point, stay away.",Rotten
Stay Alive isn't a total wash if you're looking to kill a Saturday afternoon or night if you get off on hearing little kids scream.,Fresh
Stay Alive consistently proves itself to be the most idiotic film this year that wasn't directed by Uwe Boll.,Rotten
"It's all too predictable, so where's the suspense?",Rotten
This week's stupid but harmless PG-13 cookie-cutter horror film.,Rotten
"makes minimal sense, displays minimal style, and provides minimal entertainment",Rotten
"With all the gamer product endorsements (Alienware, PS2), you'd think they could afford someone to write a better ending for a decent idea.",Rotten
An anemic attempt to update the horror genre's imperiled-teens-meet-bloodletting-uber-fiend substratum.,Rotten
"It's unlikely that Stay Alive could ever have been a good movie in the traditional sense, but it might have been better if Bell and co-writer Matthew Peterman had done more to exploit their gaming premise.",Rotten
"It's too tame to be scary and too silly to take seriously. What it does seriously is waste time, which is fine if you really don't have anything better to do, like, say, count cracks in the sidewalk.",Rotten
Perhaps the worst horror film to not have Uwe Boll's name in the credits.,Rotten
"The star of Stay Alive is a cutting-edge video game, but the film still has hackneyed horror at its heart.",Rotten
This movie will bore you to death,Rotten
A notion of an outline of a rough draft of a killer video-game flick.,Rotten
"There's a fascinating and terrifying story to be told about Elizabeth Bathory, the dramatically depraved 17th century sadist known as the Blood Countess. This ain't it.",Rotten
Maybe video games really do rot the mind.,Rotten
Here's a movie that tries to be a video game but is less entertaining than a vending machine.,Rotten
"This is a cool/potentially creepy idea only if you're in high school and goofing around with your friends at the movie theater. For everyone else, this isn't just a preposterous premise for a horror movie, it's a source of unintentional hilarity.",Rotten
"The hybrid of cyber antics and bayou creepiness doesn't quite jell, but it all ends bloodily, and in an efficient 85 minutes, too. I'm not complaining.",Rotten
"Really silly, but there's nothing inherently unlikable about the movie's silliness.",Rotten
"Videogames are no longer brainless, so why are videogame movies so slow to evolve?",Rotten
"A typical offering in the PG-13 horror-movie genre, ""Stay Alive"" won't surprise anybody, especially the young demographic toward which it is aimed.",Rotten
"Teen fodder like this isn't known for sophistication or storytelling depth, but the filmmakers seem to take the film's video-game theme as permission to eschew even the horror genre's exceedingly lenient minimums for characterization.",Rotten
"Ridiculous and then some, STAY ALIVE offers the usual slasher movie set-up: young people making one wrong decision after another.",Rotten
"Since the director and co-writer William Brent Bell does little to contrast the contrived and mechanical horror of the game with the mounting horror of the story, we can't invest much sympathy in the plight of the characters.",Rotten
"Seriously, Bell, answer me something: does the game kill you when you die on the game? Does the game kill you because you have it in your possession? Or does the game kill you period because you played it? Which is it?",Rotten
Boring!!!,Rotten
The bloody 16th Century saga of Hungary's Countess Elizabeth Bathory is transported to pre-Katrina New Orleans in this occasionally spooky but cheap and inconsequential thriller.,Rotten
"The filmmakers are so at a loss for fresh ways to shock that they even dredge up the twitchy, girl-with-hair-hanging-in-her-face trick from The Ring and The Grudge.",Rotten
"Implausibly tedious, Stay Alive has none of the vicarious thrills of, say, Konami's Silent Hill 2. It's barely even Pong unplugged.",Rotten
Never mind staying alive. You'd be doing well to simply stay awake through all 85 interminably inert minutes of Stay Alive.,Rotten
"If any of these characters were halfway decent gamers (or even hackers), their problems would be solved",Rotten
The dialogue seldom rises above the level of twaddle -- unspeakable in every sense of the word.,Rotten
A lack of logic infects this film like a virus.,Rotten
"... while its narrative style -- elliptical, fragmented, even eccentric at times -- is ambitious and imaginative, it sometimes makes for a loss of clarity and momentum.",Fresh
"Stuttering like a busted console, the film's lack of invention is only rivalled by a paucity of gore which will seem positively comical to gamers long since inured to cyberspace slaughter.",Rotten
"Something of a disappointment and nowhere near as scary as The Ring, which it rips off shamelessly.",Rotten
A cool idea rapidly falls apart. A completely missed opportunity.,Rotten
Never has a title been more horribly at odds with the way you're actually going to feel while watching the movie.,Rotten
"This movie has a nostalgic retro feel to it, like the old Universal horror movies that we now find very funny. But alas, where are all the drive-in theaters to show it in?",Rotten

"If Stay Alive teaches us anything, it's that videogames and horror films do not mix...at least in the same movie.",Rotten
"There's a gothic backstory to all this, which makes no sense but looks pretty cool.",Rotten
"One of those movies that thinks loud sounds and shaky cameras account for scares, and reminding of us of truly scary gaming experiences only amplifies its weaknesses.",Rotten
Any video game character is a better actor than the ones that work here. [Full Review in Spanish],Fresh
"All in all, an unusually amiable and well-made comedy...",Fresh
"Martin has become a superb physical comic, and Tomlin brings some unexpected warmth to a cruelly written part. A manic fuzziness takes over in the last reel and spoils some of the pleasure, but it's still a sympathetic effort.",Fresh
Steve Martin's brilliant physical comedy is only the highlight of this satisfying little giggle-fest.,Fresh
"A decent diversion, but a largely forgettable film. Martin and Tomlin try hard, but don't get as many laughs as they should.",Rotten
"A wonderful showcase for Steve Martin's physical talents, and Lily Tomlin is a scream.",Fresh
One of Steve Martin's best performances.,Fresh
Martin is only occasionally grating with his Jerry Lewis-type mannerisms.,Fresh
Beatiful comedy. Martin acts half-man/half-woman perfectly. Biting cross-gender comedy here.,Fresh
"""All of me"" is very funny, but not too outlandish, risque (at times) but not disgusting. A quality comedy with a heart.",Fresh
Steve Martin and Lily Tomlin showcase their comic zest.,Fresh
"Mr. Martin's astonishing performance is the film's most conspicuous asset, but the entire cast is good.",Fresh
"It scores a lot of points by speculating on the ways in which a man and a woman could learn to coexist in such close quarters. Against all the odds, a certain tenderness and sweetness develops by the end of the film.",Fresh
"Steve Martin delivers a marvelous, physically challenging performance in this often hilarious comedy.",Fresh
"Martin is his usual combination of flat cynicism and crazed childishness, indulging in some inspired Jerry Lewis-like clowning with his arms and legs hopelessly out of synch.",Fresh
"Martin vaults to the top of the class with his brazen, precise performance. This one goes in the time capsule.",Fresh
"Martin does some of his best acting in this film and steals the movie from Tomlin, whose character is, at best, a one-note creation.",Fresh
"Patently ridiculous, but acceptable because of the charm of the characters.",Fresh
...one could not hope for more humor than from this unassuming title.,Fresh
"A lewd, loveable comedy for teens and up.",Fresh
Carl Reiner's likeable and funny comedy about mind and body switching features a great performance from Steve Martin in one of his best roles.,Fresh
"Timeless, indelible and irrefutable proof that Steve Martin is not just among the funniest men alive. He's one of the most thoughtfully funny men alive. Plus, Carl Reiner's devilishly deft touch makes this feel appropriately like 1984 by way of 1944.",Fresh
"His manic thrashing actually hides a very measured and deliberate performance. We can see the twin halves of his body struggling to work in sync, turning a simple walk to the bathroom into a piece of comedic gold.",Fresh
"All of Me shows a fine appreciation for the little weirdnesses of life, and with comedies in short supply, it may provide the best shenanigans of the season.",Fresh
"It's a ridiculous story, and the screenplay stuffs it with low jokes and bathroom humor. Yet a number of scenes are sly as well as silly, and director Carl Reiner knows when to inject a little pathos for a change of pace.",Fresh
...a decidedly out-there premise that's employed to watchable yet far-from-memorable effect by filmmaker Carl Reiner...,Fresh
"Once the body-snare joke is under way, however, invention tends to flag and much of the ensuing humour explores the realms of fairly obvious smut -- brightly enough managed, though, if yon have a weakness for that.",Fresh
"At first the film is content to play the situation for raucous laughs, trading on the embarrassment of two sexes sharing the same body. But, once the parties start experiencing finer feelings, the film finally becomes too awkward for comfort.",Rotten
Most of the film is about as funny as falling off a cliff while trying to solve a crossword puzzle.,Rotten
Martin is hilarious as the man who has to cope with a suddenly split identity.,Fresh
"An absurd fantasy comedy, based on a dumb premise.",Rotten
All Quiet on the Western Front is a classic anti-war drama.,Fresh
"The authenticity of the battles, the realism of its consequences, and the wise use of emotions leave the public with a dry taste, a justified discomfort. [Full Review in Spanish]",Fresh
"Despite some sketchy story elements, much of it is pretty intoxicating -- that is, until the unambiguous life lessons bring pic down to earth with an earnest splat.",Rotten
"After all the put-upon jokes about trailer trash, finally here is a place where the terminology of community really defines itself.",Fresh
An atmospheric ensemble piece boasting several richly portrayed characters.,Fresh
The gossamer spell is undone when the script topples into melodrama and then a too-tidy resolution.,Rotten
"Dreamland might be found on a dirt road outside Sundance, but it's a path that all too obviously leads to Hollywood.",Rotten
The awe-inspiring New Mexico scenery and light and the performance of lead actress Agnes Bruckner lift this teen drama above the usual fare.,Fresh
"The filmmakers were clearly not interested in the ending but in exploring the characters and the situation, and they do that with sophistication and genuine feeling, both for the people and the environment.",Fresh
As swoony and verbose and serious as an adolescent's journal entry.,Rotten
"The performances are all fine, with Bruckner and Corbett the standouts as a parent and child with roles reversed after a death in the family.",Fresh
a long way to go for such a tepid lesson,Rotten
...there's little doubt that the film heralds the arrival of a promising new director.,Fresh
"The cast is solid, the characters fascinating, the direction notable, the story shaky.",Fresh
"As the mother of a preteen daughter who has dragged me to a number of teen movies, I was captivated by this strange mutant of a movie. There is skill here, and some poignant scenes that stayed with me, including a first kiss scene that's one of the bette",Fresh
"As coffee drinkers know, not all beans are equal, but the meaning of inequality gets an entirely different spin in Marc and Nick Francis' handsome and astute doc, Black Gold.",Fresh
Nowhere near as probing as it could or should be. Valuable points are blunted by too many talking heads.,Rotten
"There is obviously a serious imbalance here and even if the filmmakers don't get the complete picture, they at least make a case for the farmers themselves.",Fresh
"Black Gold, a compelling documentary about the international coffee industry, might discourage you from ever drinking a cup of joe again. At the very least, it'll make you think deeply about what's going into that cup.",Fresh
A film to think about every time you order a Triple Grande Soy Latte.,Fresh
This cleverly crafted film -- the mix of exotic locations and music is entertaining in its own right -- starts backwards by following high-quality Ethiopian beans back to where they are grown and sold for far less than they are worth.,Fresh
"...gorgeously-shot, melancholy.",Fresh
"No mere Western-guilt-inducing harangue, this highly informative documentary by British brothers Marc and Nick Francis is a model of patient storytelling.",Fresh
The film raises issues that were mere sound bites during the 2005 G8 Summit. All that's missing is Bono's seal of approval.,Fresh
"There are shocking facts and supportive images, but the film lacks investigative spirit.",Rotten
"A beautifully made, provocative and very righteous documentary.",Fresh
The documentary Black Gold tells an unresolved modern version of the age-old David and Goliath story.,Fresh
Black Gold is more an Al Gore-style message of hope than a total downer.,Fresh
The film serves as a valuable explanation of the ways in which the cultivation and exportation of a particular crop can affect the welfare of fragile countries.,Fresh
A mesmerizing documentary illuminating the human element in one corner of modern global trade.,Fresh
A dry but enlightening documentary.,Fresh
Meskela's is a story worth tackling again -- but without the over-caffeinated approach.,Rotten
It almost makes you want to be forced to spend six bucks for a latte.,Fresh
"Compared to a documentary like Darwin's Nightmare, which found disturbing visual analogues for the moral rot of global trade, Black Gold makes most of its points in words, not pictures.",Rotten
"Although some scenes register with strong impact, there also seems to be a lot of padding, and the overall narrative is ultimately too diffused and unfocused for the film to have the sociological impact it so obviously desires.",Rotten
Guaranteed to make you think twice about what you're paying for what you're drinking.,Fresh
"""Black Gold"" also finds cause for optimism in its connections, showing how if Western coffee drinkers make the right choices at their end, they can positively affect the African growers at the other.",Fresh
"This is a documentary that gets a lot across while avoiding cliches and easy exploitation, even in famine-ravaged places where more horrific images must have abounded.",Fresh
More dynamism and knowledge in the telling and fewer cheap shots at young Starbucks workers in Seattle wouldn't have gone amiss.,Fresh
A hard-hitting documentary in support of Fair Trade focusing on the tireless efforts of a manager of a coffee grower's cooperative in Ethiopia to get members more money for their labors.,Fresh
A beautifully made film that takes time to observe the beauties (and horrors) of its world.,Fresh
"The lesson is clear: The system is broken and needs repair, and educating consumers is part of the solution.",Fresh
... a by turns poetic and hard-hitting critique of the global coffee industry ...,Fresh
Economic repression by competitive market forces is a systemic injustice in this corner of the marketplace.,Fresh
"Punctuated by long shots of foggy mountainsides as well as very close shots of glistening green coffee beans on the tree, the film makes its argument with the help of an evocative score by Andreas Kapsalis.",Fresh
"The premise powerfully postulated here is that not only Ethiopians, but millions and millions of other Africans are suffering due to the paltry prices paid by big business for natural resources which most people from developed countries take for granted.",Fresh
"Warm relaxing pace becomes languishing, most of the beans have been spilt by the halfway mark. Still, it's definitely educational, an effective call to action.",Rotten
Black Gold raises issues in an engaging way without preaching or becoming a lesson in economics. At the end of it all you will certainly be looking for those Fair Trade stickers.,Fresh
The film's effectiveness is bolstered by juxtaposed scenes of fat and happy Americans and Europeans slurping up frozen chai lattes and clucking about how big Starbuck's is getting with scenes of children going into 'therapeutic feeding centers'.,Fresh
"Black Gold moves at an inexorable pace, painstakingly building a case until suddenly it looms very large and casts an even longer shadow.",Fresh
"... there is an additional irony to the title: The raw beans are not themselves black, but the growers are.",Fresh
"Whether due to resources or time or just plain laziness, directors Marc and Nick Francis have fashioned a rather shapeless movie that raises many good points but fails to fully investigate its findings.",Rotten
"If that $2 cup of Starbucks didn't jolt you awake, this documentary by Marc and Nick Francis might do the trick.",Fresh
An important and timely film that may make you think twice before downing your next cup of joe.,Fresh
The Francis brothers maintain a lively pace and a satirical mood.,Fresh
"While the film is quick to posit fair trade as a solution, it fails to answer why, even with Meskela's admirable initiatives, his coffee farmers still struggle to buy shoes.",Fresh
If you don't buy Fair Trade coffee after this you never will.,Fresh
"A worthy look at an exploitation that really shouldn't exist in this day and age, Black Gold will hopefully shock audiences into looking for the Fairtrade symbol next time they're in the supermarket.",Fresh
"True, fair trade coffee is not the newest story around, but Black Gold still makes for arresting viewing.",Fresh
Contrast that with shots of the grower's malnourished children relying on emergency foreign aid and it's enough to make your blood boil - never mind the coffee.,Fresh
"Intimate interviews with starving farmers selling beans for 24p a kilo while we pay 2 a cup will make you appreciate the importance of fair-trade when ordering your next double-shot, skinny latte.",Fresh
"While it may prompt some to think again next time they're in Starbucks, this astute insight into the coffee business is better at lauding the good guys than taking the multinationals to task for the iniquities of the global economy.",Fresh
"It is attractively shot, thoughtfully edited, provocatively argued, and might just have you turning its issues over in your mind late into the night - or is that just the effect of so much coffee?",Fresh
"Rossen's film chronicles this life of raw power with compelling scenes, and Crawford's performance is well-supported by the rest of the cast.",Fresh
"All the King's Men (1949) is the fictionalized account of the rise and fall of a backwoods rebel - a story inspired by the rule (and abuse of power) of Louisiana's colorful state governor and Democratic U.S. Senator, the notorious Huey Pierce Long...",Fresh
"Goodness me, this movie could not have been more prophetic had Nostradamus himself written it.",Fresh
"The acting is way over-the-top, however, Broderick Crawford is great!",Fresh
This political allegory adapted from Robert Penn Warren's Pulitzer Prize-winning novel is an on-target portrait of a backwoods populist (reminiscent of Huey Long) who becomes the electorate's messiah.,Fresh
Mr. Rossen has assembled in this starkly unprettified film a piece of pictorial journalism that is remarkable for its brilliant parts.,Fresh
Splendid portrait of political corruption. More timely than ever.,Fresh
"Broderick Crawford is no Orson Welles, but this meditation on the underbelly of American politics is at least in the same league as Citizen Kane.",Fresh
"Outstanding poltical commentary, rife with tension.",Fresh
It features one of the great performances in movie history.,Fresh
A classic tale of power corrupting absolutely,Fresh
"Based on Pulitzer-prize winning novel, Rossen's film is a grimly realistic study of the corrutive nature of personal and poltical power, focusing on the tumultuous career of Senator Hughey Stark.",Fresh
"Not only has this movie stood the test of time, but its content is as uncomfortable and relevant today as it was the day the film premiered.",Fresh
Stark is a work of art; a walking id whose momentum surges like the adrenaline that busts through his veins as he delivers his fist-pumping speeches.,Fresh
It's inspired by the career of populist Louisiana governor (1928-32) and Democratic U.S. Senator (1932-35) Huey Long.,Fresh
Broderick Crawford gives an outstanding performance as the corrupt politician Willie Stark.,Fresh
"Today, its realism seems bland, its moralizing forced.",Rotten
"While [Crawford's] full-bodied performance still holds up nearly six decades later, the rest of Robert Rossen's Best Picture winner has lost a good deal of its fierce luster.",Fresh
A savage indictment of the system.,Fresh
"Smart, fascinating and horrifying, All the King's Men is an example of late 1940s filmmaking at its best.",Fresh
A fine adaptation of Robert Penn Warren's Pulitzer novel.,Fresh
"It is a film that vividly impresses, with dramatic sureness the chicanery of politics as have been practiced in the past and may crop up again.",Fresh
"The rather heavy-handed movie, which also gained the Best Picture Oscar, benefited from bull-necked Crawford's hard-hitting performance and the effective blend of location photography and studio work.",Fresh
Details the rise and fall of a Southern politician,Fresh
A poisonous political process from our not-so-distant past dominates Robert Rossen's classic film about the rise of a Southern demagogue.,Fresh
"A blistering and still powerful political drama that deservedly won the best picture Oscar, with the best actor award going to gruff Broderick Crawford in the performance of a lifetime as Willie Stark.",Fresh
"A one-note actor, Crawford landed the role of a lifetime and makes the most of it, even if there isn't much variation in his eventual change from the earnest Stark to the evil Stark. Far better are John Ireland and especially Mercedes McCambridge.",Fresh
It is one of the most vital and honest films to come out of Hollywood in a long time.,Fresh
"Its political commentary is certainly blunt, but it's also a dynamic character drama full of excellent acting.",Fresh
"Strong stuff, aided by great photography.",Fresh
"His film never loses the speed and impact of its subject; and Rossen's use of his camera and of crowds -- apparently so spontaneous, and yet so dramatic -- keeps the watcher absorbed in happenings that might come from life.",Fresh
"In short, this story of blackmail, graft and intimidation makes a powerful and interesting film, and much of the honour due to it must go to Mr. Robert Rossen, its director.",Fresh
Rossen hasn't even tried to create something different yet true in another medium. He has attempted a literal illustration of the novel by violent pictorial means and he has put in too much and too little.,Rotten
Warren's demagogue turned loose on a democracy too innocent to recognize a political demon is a man to deep-freeze the heart. As movie hero-villains go. he is the best character the screen has found in a long time.,Fresh
"The cast Is tremendous, though only three or four carry the heavy end of the log. Broderick Crawford makes a very good job as Stark, whom he portrays as a likable U.S. reprobate, in whom there are still sparks of decency.",Fresh
"As American as a doughnut in sentiment, the film is full of realistic scenes of vicious, corrupt, and wild jockeying in the area of cheap politics.",Fresh
"The protagonists devolve into antagonists, until there's no one left to be the hero.",Fresh
"It is as penetrating as a searchlight and as strong as a jolt of straight alcohol. There is no compromise with reality, no sentimentality, it is hard and honest and immensely satisfying.",Fresh
[An] unpretentious and absorbing video doc.,Fresh
"It's a hard, fast film that needs airing now, or at least before the Newark elections of 2006.",Fresh
Street Fight sputters with anger and despair at the durability of dumb-cluck demagoguery in American politics.,Fresh
A tough and brave little documentary about the brutal 2002 Newark mayoral election.,Fresh
"This is classical activist filmmaking of the first order, a movie with the power to turn hearts, change minds and, just maybe, right the wayward course of an entire city.",Fresh
"It's a fascinating film, simultaneously enthralling, infuriating and guaranteed to make viewers ask how such a perversion of the political process could be taking place in America.",Fresh
"James is his own worst enemy in the documentary, behaving in public as a near caricature of Boss Tweed. But he won and is now serving out his fifth term.",Fresh
"The story that first-time feature filmmaker Curry tells is extremely compelling, but where he really scores is in addressing politics and race in a way that allows events to speak for themselves.",Fresh
It's kind of reassuring to see good old-fashioned dirty politics practiced with as much gusto as they are in the Oscar-nominated documentary Street Fight.,Fresh
"In brief, Marshall Curry, the young director of Street Fight, has hit the documentary jackpot.",Fresh
"If you didn't already realize that politics can be a dirty business, then Marshall Curry's Oscar-nominated documentary will set you straight.",Fresh
[Marshall] Curry's picture is must-see fare for any and every observer of the curious world of American politics.,Fresh
The documentary is simple and strong and small. Its grit lifts it above its mechanical shortcomings.,Fresh
"There's no question which side Curry favors, but he turns Street Fight into an old fashioned political yarn, featuring hand-pumping and baby-kissing, but also a dash of blood fury.",Fresh
"an amazing work, thrilling and informative in equal amounts, reminding us that democracy isn't just fought over on message boards and foreign battlegrounds, but also on our very streets",Fresh
It's essential viewing to prove to yourself that you're not so cynical after all.,Fresh
"It's utterly fascinating, and if you don't follow New Jersey politics, you will be kept in the dark about the outcome of this 2002 race almost to the end.",Fresh
"Booker and James square-off for a heavyweight political fight reminiscent of Holyfield vs. Tyson, except for the eating of ears.",Fresh
a primer for any aspiring politician to see the worst of what he can expect,Fresh
"""...completely gripping and enraging.""",Fresh
"Street Fight isn't going to restore your faith in our desperately broken electoral system, but Cory Booker -- and the last moments of the movie -- may help you harbor that little flame of hope.",Fresh
"Funny, infuriating, and suspenseful, Street Fight is both a critique of the process and a vindication.",Fresh
"Just dull and forgettable, not the so-bad-it's-good camp classic some people insist.",Rotten
"The material is so slight it can hardly bear the weight of music, and it sinks altogether during a series of the most incompetent and clumsy dance numbers I've ever seen.",Rotten
"The conjunction of truth and lies hardly seems accidental in a film that sets out to recall a kind of filmmaking now lost, but succeeds only in denting pleasant memories.",Rotten
"At the moment the characters descend into the valley of Shangri-La, the film, in unconscious critical mimicry, goes downhill",Fresh
The musical aspects are the most disastrous because the cast is a first-rate one in straight performance.,Rotten
Funny and real.,Fresh
Indie coming-of-age dramedy about a precocious Chinese-American youth whose family operates a sleazy roadside motel signals arrival of a singularly promising filmmaker.,Fresh
"While there's no denying that filmmaker Michael Kang possesses a fair amount of talent, this certainly isn't an appropriate vehicle with which to judge his abilities.",Rotten
The backdrop of this seedy motel is just the perfect place to illustrate the awkward times of early teen life.,Fresh
"Like Jared Hess before him, director Michael Kang is the new kid on the block who wants to play inside Wes Anderson's clubhouse.",Fresh
"There's little originality in the joy rides, first kisses, and clashes with bullies, yet this 2005 debut feature by writer-director Michael Kang captures the small triumphs of a boy becoming a man.",Fresh
"Michael Kang's small, perfectly observed portrait of a Chinese-American boy captures the glum desperation of inhabiting the biological limbo of early adolescence.",Fresh
"The Motel, Michael Kang's modest Sundance applause reaper, doesn't deserve to be shotgunned for the sins of 30 other movies. But the underwhelming syncopation of make-nice clichs is too familiar.",Rotten
"Kang's film avoids broad generalizations about the Asian-American experience to focus on the horrors of adolescence, when differences in race and ethnicity can only add to the general torment.",Fresh
"Michael Kang Kang makes an impressive feature directorial debut with The Motel. But the person to keep an eye on is Jeffrey Chyau, a student at the Bronx High School of Science, who is a delight in the lead role.",Fresh
"Like the best independent films, The Motel realizes that life is made up of minor pleasures and tiny epiphanies, not sweeping character arcs or big dramatic moments",Fresh
"Unlike so many indie films, Michael Kang's gently empathetic debut embraces eccentricity without drowning in its own hip irony.",Fresh
The film about of a teenage Chinese-American boy struggling with adolescent issues while working in his family's fleabag motel has the precise brevity of a well-crafted short story.,Fresh
"It's actually really touching in parts, as well as infuriating.",Fresh
"The third effort of Korean-American writer-director Michael Kang of New York brings attention to his unique demographic, but should have been a better made movie.",Rotten
A well-worn coming-of-age tale enlivened by pungent detail and a sharp visual sense.,Fresh
"Even if writer-director Michael Kang doesn't exactly break new ground, he imbues his debut with a quiet, compelling inertia that mimics puberty's rudderless drift, its burgeoning desire for something, anything, to change.",Fresh
"It's Kang's understanding of human nature -- not particularly profound, but true and sharp as a perfectly drawn arrow -- that makes this unpretentious production sing.",Fresh
...specific and detailed enough to separate itself from the pack.,Fresh
"... suffers from rocky moments and an unsure eye, but [Kang's] sense of detail is rich with prickly contradictions and he resists tidying up the story.",Fresh
"There is honesty and integrity in the filmmaking and the performances, which make The Motel among the best character studies of the year.",Fresh
"It's a modest triumph of unflattering realism, proving yet again that a camera, a few good actors, the right material and a sensitive director are all you need to illuminate any particular aspect of humanity.",Fresh
"It's pretty much a customary coming-of-age tale, though it is told with refreshing honesty and realism.",Fresh
"Kang and Chyau make for a great team, with Chyau able to give an honest performance that requires humiliation, but never disrespect.",Fresh
"As rundown as it is and as downbeat as its denizens are, only 76 minutes seems like too short a stay at ""The Motel.""",Fresh
"Each of Ernest's interactions and epiphanies is pure, calculated movieland.",Rotten
Perhaps The Motel meanders a bit too much -- hard to do in a 76-minute film -- but it is an engaging little movie.,Fresh
"The Motel gives the lie to all those mainstream teen sex comedies starring happy, horny gwailos .",Fresh
"A most impressive feature film debut by writer/director Michael Kang who has crafted a compelling tale by examining rites of passage from a fresh perspective, namely, that of a Chinese-American adolescent.",Fresh
"A welcome addition to the ""awkward adolescence"" genre,",Fresh
A wonderful reminder that adult life is never as difficult as puberty was.,Fresh
Michael Kang resolutely sticks to telling the story from Ernest's limited point of view...,Fresh
"Such a heady combination of greed, girls and goals, all set to a pulsating funk background, should provide even a hardened football refusenik with 90 minutes (+ stoppage time) of entertainment.",Fresh
A lively 1970s tone that neatly captures soccer's brief North American heyday.,Fresh
Full of drama and fascinating anecdotes.,Fresh
An engrossing account of American soccer's strangest episode -- and you don't even have to like footie to enjoy it.,Fresh
"A good yarn well spun, a story so fascinating that you'll be hooked until the very end.",Fresh
The film is an uncanny reflection of soccer itself: intermittently engaging but generally a dramatically inert bore.,Rotten
"An entertaining documentary that won't change the world, but should leave you spellbound for 90 minutes.",Fresh
"A fun and rowdy take on the New York Cosmos, who almost succeeded in bringing soccer into the American mainstream during the late 1970s.",Fresh
This intermittently fascinating documentary chronicles the rise and fall of the Cosmos--which is also the rise and fall of U.S. soccer.,Fresh
"...a stylish scramble of evocative footage, groovy music, and crazy-candid reminiscences from key players still proud to score.",Fresh
"The perfect mix of style and substance, visuals, music and words ... one of the best sports documentaries ever made.",Fresh
"An enlightening look back at how ""the world's sport"" briefly took off in the US.",Fresh
"Told in a breezy, fast-cut style, and backed by a boisterous soundtrack that ranges from Puccini to James Brown, Lifetime focuses on the players -- on the field and off -- that made the Cosmos such a super, if short-lived, team.",Fresh
"Giddy, gossipy and endearingly unslick, Once in a Lifetime chronicles the rise and fall of the most famous soccer team in the United States with slapdash glee.",Fresh
"If nothing else, the energetic documentary Once In A Lifetime proves that an audience once existed for soccer in this country, and could be cultivated again.",Fresh
"Crowder and Dower's film is a refreshing reminder that... without the Cosmos' brief and shining moment in the sun, suburban soccer leagues would be as rare as collegiate boccie tournaments.",Fresh
"A colorful time capsule of 1970s New York... the doc's jauntiness is enhanced by its many charismatic characters and a funky, wall-to-wall soundtrack...",Fresh
The documentary offers enough color and depth to hold your interest and leave you keen to see the World Cup finals.,Fresh
"No Hollywood scriptwriter would dare make up a tale as outrageously unlikely -- but, as it happens, true -- as the one so entertainingly told in the documentary Once in a Lifetime: The Extraordinary Story of the New York Cosmos.",Fresh
Once in a Lifetime performs a belated autopsy on the Cosmos and the North American Soccer League and basically concludes that they died of impatience.,Fresh
"Whether or not the ""dream"" of a thriving U.S. soccer league might ever be realized, this moment retains a thrilling illogic and undeniable energy.",Fresh
"Needless to say, until the unhappy ending, we've got an entertaining and edifying romp.",Fresh
"Crowder and Dower wonderfully coax the participants to tell us everything and present it in a very entertaining, engaging and informative way that will have fans and non-fans laughing all the way",Fresh
Far more entertaining than it has a right to be.,Fresh
Anyone who wants to relive this flamboyant but fleeting chapter in America's uneven soccer history should not miss this.,Fresh
"About a brief gathering of high-paid superstars slumming it in America at the ego-driven whimsy of one of the world's most powerful moguls (who himself had nothing to lose, since the whole venture was on Warner's tab).",Rotten
"You don't need to be a soccer fan to, like Cosmos fans, fall for this captivating tale, told in Rashomon-like style.",Fresh
"Aptly portrays the country's brief love affair with soccer and acknowledges that it will continue to thrive, whether we're paying attention or not.",Fresh
"Lively, free-wheeling amusement.",Fresh
"A slick, gossipy documentary that pulses to the strains of James Brown, Parliament and the Love Unlimited Orchestra as it glosses over facts to make its questionable case for the Cosmos.",Rotten
"This is not an exercise in fabricated nostalgia, but a raucous chronicle of defeat snatched from the jaws of victory.",Fresh
A spot-on goal.,Fresh
"Another soccer film? Buy, hey, it's about a NEW YORK soccer team, glorifying the late Steve Ross, the number one corporate viper! For those who believe the world ends at the Hudson River only.",Rotten
"Through interviews with former players, coaches, and company officials, as well as archival footage, the film traces the club's amazing rise and ultimate disintegration.",Fresh
"An energetic and often enjoyable documentary, particularly for soccer fans.",Fresh
Once in a Lifetime does a wonderful job of showing that this collection of foreigners playing a foreign sport forged one of the great American sports stories.,Fresh
"The movie is only so-so, borrowing a little from the VH-1 school of popumentary but lacking the snazzy production values.",Rotten
Essentially an extended cable special.,Rotten
How that dream was realized and what factors brought it and its league to a horrific crash scarcely a decade later is the intriguing drama that directors Paul Crowder and John Dower are able to reconstruct.,Fresh
The movie is ultimately too long and too this-no-name-player- was-traded-for-that- no-name-player detailed for casual viewers.,Rotten
"Once in a Lifetime would have benefited greatly from historical and outside perspective, but the story on screen is such a kick that even monotone narrator Matt Dillon gets caught up in the excitement.",Fresh
"It has some funny scenes and wild characters who reflect back on the glory years, where the clashes of ego were as legendary as Pel√©'s amazing bicycle-kick goals.",Fresh
"New York went bust, so did the team, yet scattered seeds for smarter soccer growth later.",Fresh
"Once in a Lifetime is riveting cinema for at least an hour, after which it starts to feel a bit like thumbing through a scrapbook. But American soccer fans -- and those interested in the business of sports -- will eat it up.",Fresh
"It's a rags-to-riches story that shows how American money and imagination revolutionized not just a team, but the entire sport of soccer, back then and still to this day.",Fresh
"Once in a Lifetime is a marvelous primer on this remarkable event in soccer history, most likely never to be seen again.",Fresh
"Once in a Lifetime, which relies on interviews and archival footage, may not be a great documentary, but it certainly gets its points across.",Fresh
"... the film is bursting with astonishing old footage, hip tunes, vivid interviews and you-couldn't- make-it-up anecdotes.",Fresh
... treats its audience like a bunch of attention deficit disorder cases.,Rotten
... accomplishes the minor miracle of making you mourn a sports team you likely never knew existed in the first place.,Fresh
"Packed with observations and recrimations, many of the latter aimed at or by Chinaglia, which makes for some gossipy entertainment.",Fresh
"An energetically told tale, with eccentric characters to spare and a nostalgically bittersweet tone.",Fresh
With just a little tweaking ... could be reworked in a Christopher Guest-style mockumentary of swollen egos and corporate whimsy.,Rotten
mostly I'm stricken with nostalgia for '70s fashion and Marv Albert's hairdo,Fresh
"Not being a soccer fan, the Cosmos phenomenon had no impact on me at the time nor does this energetic film change that opinion.",Fresh
"Well-researched and exuberantly compiled, this is a thoroughly entertaining tribute to America's first tackle at surgically implanting the beautiful game.",Fresh
Once in a Lifetime is like a soccer team that plays good defense but lacks offense.,Rotten
Requiem shows us with a sense of palpable reality (and without any special effects) what being -- or feeling -- possessed must be like for Michaela herself and her family.,Fresh
[A] stunningly played story of faith vs. family.,Fresh
Closely observed story of the mental and family pressures that can lead someone to accept an exorcism.,Fresh
...never quite as compelling as Hller's performance...,Fresh
Sandra Hueller deservedly won an acting prize in Berlin (she could have taken home 'most conflicted character' as well).,Fresh
"The film is incisive about the all-too-mundane social, physical and emotional pressures exacted upon its heroine.",Fresh
"Hller's master class in acting is not only a portrait of a holy creature frenzied by otherworldly spirits but a voluptuous reflection of the pressures that accosted so many women of her character's age, time, and devotions.",Fresh
This quietly unnerving psychological study from German director Hans-Christian Schmid wields its ambiguity about religion and science like a double-edged blade.,Fresh
"Progresses in a natural, unforced style that's increasingly creepy and ultimately emotionally shattering.",Fresh
Like The Exorcism of Emily Rose ... Requiem is loosely based on the real-life story of a West German woman who died in 1976 after a series of failed exorcisms.,Fresh
"Takes the flashback sequences from Exorcism of Emily Rose, removes all the supernatural scares, and tries to keep you interested.",Rotten
Just as haunting as a horror film and far more heartrending.,Fresh
"Requiem isn't a horror movie so much as a thwarted coming-of-age story, like Carrie without the bloody reckoning.",Fresh
A demonic posession movie WITHOUT special effects? Horrors!!!,Rotten
"Bogumil Godfrejow's raw cinematography and (Sandra) Huller's poignant, close-to-the-bone performance transform what might have been a morbid curiosity into an entirely enthralling, quietly terrifying experience.",Fresh
"You won't find rotating heads and vomit in the exorcism movie Requiem. Instead, German director Hans-Christian Schmid relies on a frighteningly realistic performance by Sandra Huller as blue-eyed blonde Michaela.",Fresh
[Sandra Hller's] intensity is so compelling you truly have no idea if those demons are real.,Fresh
"Quietly devastating and unbearably moving, this is a soul-searching classic.",Fresh
"In lesser hands, Requiem would seem merely bleak, but Schmid makes a rigorously urgent and compelling film out of Michaela's odyssey.",Fresh
"Based on the same story as The Exorcism of Emily Rose, this is a far more accurate and ultimately much more frightening version of events, with an award-winning performance from Huller.",Fresh
"What cannot be debated is the strength of Huller's naturalistic lead performance, a frighteninglyn intense turn that brings to mind Emily Watson's work in Breaking the Waves.",Fresh
"The nonsensationalistic results are also somewhat ho-hum -- and oddly less convincing than Friedkin's lurid mess, let alone the elegant satanism sagas of Tourneur and Polanski.",Rotten
"The confusion and panic and everyday interactions in Requiem feel honest and true-to-life, which has nothing to do with how factual it is, or isn't.",Fresh
"Stage actress Sandra Huller delivers a stunning, understated performance...",Fresh
"The movie ends a little too abruptly, but it features a heartrending performance from Sandra Huller that brought her the best actress award at this year's Berlin Film Festival.",Fresh
"A naturalistic and thrillingly powerful film, with a stand-out performance from Hller at its centre.",Fresh
"Working from an economical and intelligent script by Bernd Lange , Schmid directs his first feature with the easy conviction that eluded the makers of the preposterous Emily Rose.",Fresh
"Sandra Hueller leads a fine cast and gives a textured performance as wallflower Michaela who is suddenly freed when she goes out into the world, only to be done in by her inner, psychosis-driven demons.",Fresh
[Huller] combines the raw physicality of Michaela's seizures with an emotional confusion as she ponders the cause of her attacks and how to react to them.,Fresh
"A tragic tale of teen rebellion and misplaced faith, this is a sober and sobering account of a young girl's untimely end, made enthralling by great performances and restrained direction.",Fresh
"What matters in Requiem amounts to the fine performances, Schmid's assured hand, and the magnificent rustic scenery.",Fresh
"A convincing portrayal of a helpless soul wavering between fear and faith, and the madness of murder being perpetrated in the name of Christ.",Fresh
"an intense, disturbing and bleak drama of ecstasy and insanity, all set in a world where, if there is a God at all, it truly requires a leap of faith into the dark to grasp Him.",Fresh
"In the end, Requiem is something of a disappointment.",Rotten
"Over-complicated script, which tries to mix science, ghost cliches and protags' personal problems in a single pot, starts OK but gradually runs out of steam after the first 40 minutes.",Rotten
"The film relies heavily on dramatic music for its thrills and some of the effects are a bit cheesy, but it appears to be so well meant that these flaws are easily forgiven.",Fresh
"Depois de prender a ateno do pblico durante sua metade inicial graas a idias e momentos interessantes, o roteiro se perde sem maiores avisos, transformando-se em uma baguna capaz de levar at mesmo o mais paciente dos espectadores  loucura.",Rotten
Su Chao-Bin does some remarkable things by keeping his little ghost in plain sight; he creates the kind of dead-on spectral chills that all the silly jump-scares in the world can't quite equal.,Fresh
"isn't quite the terrorfest that it's billed as, but it will hold your interest. Just don't expect to scream.",Rotten
"It's a hilarious, crowd-pleasing film about everything from honesty to sex to freedom that's definitely smart without being too overbearing.",Fresh
Enjoyably rude but uneven.,Rotten
[Makes] the most of thrifty means to highly entertaining effect.,Fresh
"A flotilla of L.A. residents gathers in an unlandscaped recreation area in Baldwin Hills to canoodle, attempt suicide, plot revenge and dig into one another's psyches in writer-director Kurt Voelker's high-spirited if slight comedy, Park.",Fresh
"If Park aspired to any real insights or to any ambition beyond the routine, its hysterics would be worth sitting through.",Rotten
"It's all harmlessly naughty at the outset, but when it comes to juggling all those characters and their intersecting scenarios, Voelker lacks the dexterity of, say, Robert Altman.",Rotten
There are plenty of laughs in the outrageous predicaments and the actors are obviously having a ball.,Fresh
"There's very little cohesion among the separate storylines and aside from some nice performances, it all seems rather pointless.",Rotten
"None of the characters seems particularly believable, except Lake's; she brings some feeling to a thin role. And the campy, ""outrageous"" comedy is pretty thin, too.",Rotten
"Suicide, infidelity, spousal abuse and arrested development are the building blocks of Park a wearisome comedy.",Rotten
"Man, have we gone downhill since Short Cuts.",Rotten
"Annoying, pretentious and impossible to follow.",Rotten
"Sustains a disturbing, somnambulistic mood...",Fresh
"It is a film whose concept is too often done, and usually only about as well as it's done here.",Rotten
"Drifting through this world with Jack, you've just got to let go and enjoy the slow burn.",Fresh
A densely etched portrait of a young man's descent into insanity.,Fresh
An 'art' movie (and we say that with the best of possible intentions) that is well worth checking out.,Fresh
"The 4th Dimension prevails for both its overall lack of pretension, as well as a more implicit approach to such psychological mindgames.",Fresh
"Accessible and entertaining, with enough local flavor to seem exotic to English viewers. Not only that, but it's FUN.",Fresh
Worth seeing for the delightful banter between Feore and Bouchard.,Fresh
It's all a bit hackneyed and cliched.,Rotten
"As with all buddy movies, Bon Cop Bad Cop succeeds on the strength of the leads' rapport.",Fresh
"Bon Cop, Bad Cop, a rare Canadian venture into straightforward commercialism, manages to work well as both light entertainment and running commentary on the culture clash between the English and French Canadas.",Fresh
"Billed as Canada's first bilingual feature, director Erik Canuel imitates US buddy film formula.",Rotten
Its good-hearted probing of Canada's social and cultural balancing act likely will do more to promote harmony in Canada than a whole raft of political speeches.,Fresh
"Bon Cop Bad Cop is what it is, and no more: un bon summer entertainment.",Fresh
Largely fun... But there is one caveat: it is almost certainly impossible to completely love this film if you're not a bilingual Canadian.,Fresh
"The political maneuverings are of some historical interest, but modern relevancy is hard to find.",Rotten
A workmanlike costumer that distills Blighty's long battle for the abolition of slavery and the personalities behind landmark antislavery legislation into a tidy story of conscience and perseverance.,Fresh
A terrific subject becomes a tepid morality play.,Rotten
Fernando Meirelles and Edward Zwick take note: Amazing Grace is proof that liberal filmmakers can make movies that aren't desperate manifestations of their political guilt.,Fresh
"Based on the true story of one man's crusade to end slavery in 18th-century Great Britain, Michael Apted's film is a conventional social injustice drama, immenseley helped by Iown Gruffudd's captivating lead performance.",Fresh
"This compelling bio-pic is an overdue tribute to William Wilberforce (1759-1833), the British abolitionist who, for 20 years, tirelessly lobbied Parliament to end England's participation in the slave trade.",Fresh
"Michael Apted's Amazing Grace, from a screenplay by Steven Knight, turns out to be blessed with inspirational nobility and comic eccentricity to bring it to emotional fruition.",Fresh
"TV in vision, structure and execution. To think feature film as a delivery vehicle for it is more ambitious than this telling of a worthy, under-appreciated story justifies.",Rotten
An inspiring drama directed by Michael Apted about a zealous abolitionist in eighteenth century England who models for us a moral heroism.,Fresh
"Sanitized version of the career and life of William Wilberforce, who thought that the uncouth behavior of slaves was a greater sin than slavery itself. Pure hagiography and an assault on the historical record.",Rotten
"Michael Apted's Amazing Grace is a beautifully chiseled blunt instrument. No, it's not subtle, but how subtle was slavery?",Fresh
Inspiring drama of how one man can make a huge difference in the fight against the importation of slaves in Britain.,Fresh
"Though it's not as inspiring as its makers might have wished, it's a solid, respectful treatment of a significant episode in the anti-slavery movement.",Fresh
"an intelligent film about serious thinkers and their ideas, and it's director Michael Apted's spare, incisive vison that prevents the film from becoming either cloying or maudlin, though the screen is painted with emotion",Fresh
It leaves the blood unstirred.,Rotten
Apted is without a doubt one of the foremost documentarians working today. His Up Series represents a cinematic hallmark. His feature credits are less certain.,Rotten
"A creditable historical drama about those who choose to be in the world, not merely of it.",Fresh
Amazing Grace is a case of good works done well...[an] admirable historical drama.,Fresh
"A movie for people who like uncomplicated, uplifting stories where good triumphs over evil.",Fresh
"[Apted's] picture, openhearted and enthusiastic, is partly an ode to Wilberforce and partly a love letter to the simple act of taking action.",Fresh
"Amazing Grace is an important historical drama that comes out at a good time for movie-goers who want high quality, thought provoking entertainment.",Fresh
Those who take the plunge will be rewarded with an unusually satisfying and inspiring historical epic from one of contemporary cinema's best filmmakers.,Fresh
"Like Steven Spielberg's glossy Amistad before it, Amazing Grace shies away from the texture and complexity of color, scurrying instead for the safer platitudes of black and white -- good and evil.",Rotten
Director Michael Apted and his team understand the challenges of this kind of story and have met them with intelligence and energy. [He] has managed to be true to the outsized emotions of the story without giving way to sentimentality.,Fresh
"[Director Michael Apted] has an unfortunate penchant for bland stateliness, and never more so than in Amazing Grace.",Rotten
"Amazing Grace arrives Hollywood-slick, a polished British period piece. It manipulates, but then again, so does the song that gives it its title. Movies, like hymns and history, should give us a good cry.",Fresh
"It's clear that the filmmakers believe a movie about political debate has to have a lot of speechifying. Consequently, it's so talky that it gradually loses our interest, which is a real shame.",Rotten
"Earnest, respectful and thoroughly dull, Michael Apted's Amazing Grace follows all of the worst traditions of British historical dramas.",Rotten
What makes William Wilberforce a great man is also what makes him a bore: He's possessed of such intractable single-mindedness and confidence in the rightness of his ideals that we can't help but wish he would lay aside saving the world for a while.,Rotten
"It's a good story, but director Michael Apted can't help but fall into the usual cinematic habits of the hagiographic species.",Rotten
Steven Knight's ponderous script is front-loaded with expository deep background and stuffed into an awkward structure that lumbers back and forth between Wilberforce the early idealist and Wilberforce the broken man.,Rotten
"As written by Steven Knight, it seems so taken with Wilberforce's moral magnificence, it forgets to involve the audience, too.",Rotten
"How could Michael Apted, who directed those towering pillars of truth the 7 Up documentaries, make a movie as bogus as Amazing Grace?",Rotten
"Well-made by Michael Apted, and well-acted all around.",Fresh
That rare bird: a tear-jerker about the House of Commons and the antislavery movement in England. Michael Apted's idolatrous portrait of abolitionist William Wilberforce is wall-to-wall with intriguing characters and deeply felt performances.,Fresh
"The rhythms [director Michael Apted and editor Rick Shaine] establish are jumpy and unsteady, afraid of allowing a scene to breathe and flow naturally. If the script were more alive, these matters of visual technique would matter less. But not much less.",Rotten
"If you seek a movie that is uplifting, enlightening and ennobling, then Grace is for you.",Fresh
"History purists will find the details enchanting, period drama fanatics will adore the arm's-length posture of the piece, and the true-life tale is one worth being told. Just make sure to ingest loads of caffeine before watching.",Fresh
Gruffudd and the amazing cast give performances that would make this film more useful in teaching drama school than in teaching social studies.,Rotten
How do you make the slavery debates of 18th-century British parliament feel cinematic? By casting some of the best brogues around.,Fresh
Coming soon to a social studies class near you.,Fresh
"Steven Knight has enlivened what might have been workmanlike, spiced the romance with wit, spiked the period-piece punch with pizzazz.",Fresh
"Amazing Grace, a prettified take on the life and times of the 18th-century reformer William Wilberforce, carries a strong whiff of piety. It isn't a bad smell; there are notes of roses and treacle in the mix, but also elements of sweat and pain.",Fresh
Gruffudd and Apted are pleasantly earnest in their efforts to spread Wilberforce's message of peace and justice.,Fresh
"[The screenwriter] does an admirable job of streamlining a story that unfolds over the course of 20 years. Meanwhile, Apted allows his fine cast the breathing room to make historical figures feel like living, breathing people rather than waxworks.",Fresh
"A detailed, affecting biography of one of the great souls who moved humanity forward.",Fresh
"Often vulnerable, more often inspiring, Gruffudd's Wilberforce not only stirs curiosity but also quickens your conscience. As Fox notes eloquently, he was a great man. One does not have to be religious to believe he had amazing grace.",Fresh
Don't shy away for fear of a dry bit of educational cinema; Amazing Grace is a well-told and very human story.,Fresh
"Characters are so imprisoned by the movie's need to drive home its antislavery message that they become utterly lifeless. Pretty pictures abound in Amazing Grace, but they don't serve to illustrate any ideas or emotions worth wrestling with.",Rotten
"[Director] Apted gives the movie a reasonably good period feel. Working with an obviously limited budget, it feels like something you might see on the History Channel, but that's not necessarily a knock.",Fresh
"Amazing Grace isn't quite an accurate title for this entertaining history lesson, but no one will ever write a song titled 'Amazing 20-Year Period of Parliamentary Maneuvering to End Britain's Role in the Slave Trade.'",Fresh
"Michael Apted's compelling and highly informative Amazing Grace is an apt celebration of America's Black History Month, even though its story takes place in England.",Fresh
The film ultimately tells a powerful and little-known historical tale.,Fresh
"Director Michael Apted and screenwriter Steven Knight can't help letting a little sanctification take hold -- while also, sadly, making a charged historical subject seem tedious.",Rotten
Director Michael Apted tells the story with dry devotion to parliamentary procedurals and a worshipful approach to Wilberforce. But [actor] Gruffudd lacks the intensity and charisma to pull it off.,Rotten
"Amazing Grace is the stuff of great lessons and inspiration and hope, and if it's all delivered with a bit too much moral push, well, moral push apparently was what William Wilberforce was all about. There's another word for such dweebs: Heroes.",Fresh
"Director Michael Apted has turned out a movie that might be best described as faithful, both in its attention to accuracy and in its acknowledgement of the role faith played in righting one of the great social wrongs.",Fresh
"In building his movie around a single issue, Apted succeeds in capturing a rough-and-tumble side to politics that never feels too far removed from our own day.",Fresh
"I'm sure [director] Apted meant well, but Amazing Grace comes across as a surprisingly graceless biopic narrowed down to one white man's uncomfortable burden.",Rotten
"The film is inspiring. When Wilberforce finally achieves victory, Lord Fox makes a speech, in which the opening words, sadly, still ring true today: 'When people think of great men, rarely do they think of peaceful men.'",Fresh
Screenwriter Steven Knight gracefully articulates the many domestic and international forces at work.,Fresh
"The movie is the usual kind of film biography of a respected figure from the distant past -- honorable, oversimplified, handsome.",Fresh
"It's a doughty movie, stuck halfway between Masterpiece Theatre and Classics Illustrated.",Rotten
"An inspirational, moving and wonderfully well-told story that comes to the screen at just the right time.",Fresh
"Amazing Grace may not accomplish the depth of poignancy inherent in its subject, but it's a steady effort.",Fresh
"Although the film does skirt the edge of preachiness at times, you certainly can't argue with the basic human decency that it's preaching.",Fresh
"The rhetoric in the film is clearly intended to be relevant to the situation in the United States today... 'Our fear of an unknown enemy must not be allowed to erode our long-cherished liberties,' says a Wilberforce ally.",Fresh
A well-told cinematic example of a man who used his faith and God-given opportunities to change the world for good.,Fresh
"There is a cheering sense of moral force behind this film, which could have become preachy, trite and clotted with self-righteousness.",Fresh
"The focus on Wilberforce's ailing body seems a peculiar, not to say ""amazing,"" displacement of affliction.",Rotten
"A good film editor could have made this 111-minute effort into an entertaining, tight 90 minute film, without losing any of the story or suspense.",Fresh
"[Screenwriter] Knight should be remembered at year's end for not only telling a compelling story, but for delightfully smart and witty dialogue that never feels unnatural in the actors' mouths.",Fresh
Handsome bio-pic wavers between a sur+ of piety and a well done history lesson.,Fresh
"Blending period drama with message-driven political wrangling, Amazing Grace is as earnest and well-intentioned as it is unsurprising.",Fresh
"Chimes in for freedom, but rarely hits the high notes.",Rotten
...ponderous and relentlessly padded in its moral morass... Grace manages to work effectively as a crusading costume drama drenched in consciousness and conviction.,Fresh
"As square as this movie is, it has been made with eloquence and jaunty high spirits, and it tells a good story that is virtually unknown here.",Fresh
"Climax is a groundswell of tear-inducing virtue that ultimately leaves Grace on a high, if not amazing, note.",Fresh
"Think of this as ""Pride and Prejudice"" meets ""Reds"".",Fresh
"One of the nobler 'based on true events' efforts I've seen in some time, one of the most entertaining and a fine example of the work of a master-craftsman filmmaker.",Fresh
AMAZING GRACE is a second-class film on a first-class theme. The film smolders for almost two hours without ever catching emotional fire. Some enormous liberties were taken with history.,Fresh
"Perhaps more Masterpiece Theatre than motion picture, Amazing Grace nevertheless tells a story that's compelling enough to compensate for the occasional stuffiness.",Fresh
Don't miss this film.,Fresh
Amazing Grace marks an unforgettable and regrettable time in world history while highlighting a few who valiantly set out to right the wrongs.,Fresh
History as one might wish it to be taught to an earnest child.,Rotten
"All the elements work harmoniously together: beautiful settings, an extremely talented cast who bring the characters to life, gorgeous costuming and a rich script that informs and delights.",Fresh
"""Amazing"" indeed.",Fresh
Illuminates how key transformative historical moments play out in the business of everyday life.,Fresh
"There's so much story here that the characters don't have quite enough room to breathe, but it's still a fascinating look at a time, and a man, worth remembering.",Fresh
Amazing Grace's examination of men in power moved to change risks ridicule and righteousness for a smart take on history.,Fresh
"It is one of the world's great songs, and now it has a worthy movie to go with it.",Fresh
"It is to be hoped that Amazing Grace is not the only, or the last, cinematic celebration of 200th anniversary of abolition, for there are more stories to tell, more imaginatively.",Rotten
"The movie emerges in the end as a stirring and -- cover your ears, kids -- educational ode to the political power an individual with a cause can inflict on the morally bankrupt status quo.",Fresh
So much to admire and so little to amaze.,Rotten
"Accessibility is one of the movie's virtues: without dumbing down, it makes the workings of Parliament seem as gripping as a good suspense thriller.",Fresh
"Grufudd is fine, passionate and single-minded, though overly Romantic, and quietly upstaged by the extraordinary Benedict Cumberbatch.",Fresh
"Michael Apted channels history, but Grace is amazing for the modern sensibilities of its 18th-century saints.",Fresh
Gruffudd's Wilberforce lacks charisma and the House of Commons scenes are interminable. Worthy shouldn't mean dull. What a waste.,Rotten
"the film, like its central character, is resolute in its objective. Perhaps too resolute.",Fresh
"Apted directs with a firm hand and the film has been gorgeously shot by Remi Adefarasin. The large cast is generally good, with Gruffudd serving as the strong anchor.",Fresh
"The whole thing feels a bit smug and complacent, as if having a worthwhile subject were the only requirement for making a worthwhile film, and Apted directs in a respectable ""Masterpiece Theatre"" style that effectively drains away any inherent drama.",Rotten
"While the subject matter is ripe for investigation, the film isn't quite up to the challenge.",Rotten
Amazing Grace thoughtfully explores the issue of slavery without sermonizing or losing sight of the fact that modern audiences still need to connect with relatable characters no matter how important the subject matter.,Fresh
"While there is plenty to hold our interest in William Wilberforce's noble battle to abolish slavery in 18th Century Britain, as a film, Amazing Grace is overzealous and gets bogged down by details",Rotten
"Impressively directed, politically relevant and occasionally inspirational, this is an enjoyable, engaging drama with strong performances from its talented cast.",Fresh
A very decent contribution to the present bicentennial celebrations of the parliamentary bill that outlawed the slave trade in the British empire.,Fresh
"Apted's unexpected crowd-pleaser is inspirational, but also surprisingly entertaining.",Fresh
It's neither amazing nor graceful.,Rotten
"A fascinating story, a great cast, but average in its presentation.",Fresh
"Skilfully written and directed, the film is an involving drama, even if it's overly worthy and sentimental.",Fresh
"A decent cast under Michael Apted's direction does its best, but it's dull, naive and dramatically inert.",Rotten
"A good -- and important -- story, not always well told.",Fresh
"As a period piece, it's remarkably detailed, smartly written, and likably acted.",Fresh
Who'd have thought that the most compelling and thoughtful film to be presented during Black History Month would be a formal British import set in 18th century England with men running around in wigs?,Fresh
"There's a lot of good intentions behind Amazing Grace, but the movie's a bore, swirling into the minutia of antiquated British law.",Rotten
"I'm not sure what was a bigger problem for me, though--that the story jumped around so much, or that the tone did, too.",Rotten
"Amazing Grace proves to be an invaluable history lesson, but a rather boring film.",Rotten
Earnest drama about fervent English abolitionist.,Fresh
"In a year that offers the occasion for a deeper and richer look at British slavery and abolition, it is a pity that artists of the caliber of Michael Apted and Steven Knight lent their talents to a tamely traditional and misleading film.",Rotten
"Alas, the subject matter is far more interesting than the execution... It's a film bogged down with staid dialogue that reeks of horse manure.",Rotten
"Amazing Grace fails to explain the different social interests lined up against slavery, for many of whom, manufacturers and others, the question was hardly a moral one.",Rotten
Eloquent direction lifts this beyond a genre whodunit.,Fresh
"Nice, but nothing remarkable.",Rotten
"Stylish, sexy and deeply emotionally resonant.",Fresh
"Given that underwhelming police thriller The Silence is technically a made-for-TV movie, it might not be counted against helmer Cate Shortland as yet another example of the dreaded disappointing sophomore follow-up.",Rotten
...an egregiously slow-paced piece of work that works neither as a character study nor as a police procedural...,Rotten
"If it's scruff we're after, then production designer Melinda Doring obliges with compellingly old-fashioned interiors, occupied by gnarled narks and retirees.",Fresh
Informative documentary filmmaking that belongs as much on library shelves and agency case files as in your local theatre.,Fresh
"Cocaine Cowboys' in-the-moment kicks are, after the lights come up, apt to leave one with something of an ashamed and remorseful hangover.",Fresh
"Sure, the bombast is extreme, and, yes, it spends more time on tall tales than impact reports, but this vigorous, energetic doc captures the allure of a business that has never thrived on subtlety.",Fresh
"The story is fascinating, if a little overlong, and makes you want to see a high-profile, big-name Griselda Blanco movie happen, like, tomorrow.",Fresh
"A rogues gallery of flamboyant gangsters paint an anecdote-rich portrait of the drug trade, while a steady stream of cops, coroners and crime reporters furnish social commentary.",Fresh
"An exhaustive, exciting and ultimately exhausting history.",Fresh
"Set during the cocaine wars of the late '70s and early '80s, this documentary is out to reveal how Miami vice really worked.",Fresh
"What was needed was the Frontline approach; what is provided, sadly, is Brian de Palma Lite.",Rotten
"A slick look at the cocaine trade of the 70s/80s that made Miami the home of more homicides per capita, and more banks per square mile, than any other city in America.",Fresh
"An exhilarating documentary that details the chaos, glamour and greed of the drug industry in Miami during the 1970s and '80s.",Fresh
"Cocaine cash financed Miami's renaissance, but the film never downplays the human cost at which that urban renewal was purchased.",Fresh
"While it's a bit haphazardly organized and offers only a cursory analysis of the drug war's impact on the city, Billy Corben's second documentary is ultimately as compelling as any pulp yarn.",Fresh
"Parts of Cocaine Cowboys manage the impossible -- making cocaine boring. But the film doesn't shy away from presenting horrific images: We see blood-streaked walls, bullet-perforated bodies and Katie Couric's haircut circa 1981.",Rotten
"If The Godfather movies were based on real gangsters and some of them were still around to talk about the good old days, they might be as fascinating as the characters in Billy Corben's documentary about the cocaine import business in 1970s Miami.",Fresh
"An exercise in blood-soaked nostalgia, a look back at an era (the late 1970s and early 1980s) when Miami was a bad and dangerous place to live.",Fresh
Bullets fly and dead bodies drop like whacked weeds in this startling documentary about the bad old days of the Miami drug trade.,Fresh
One worrisome aspect here is the absence of any condemnation of self or substance on the part of the three principal participant-interviewees.,Rotten
"Cocaine Cowboys is kinetic and absorbing, the documentary equivalent of GoodFellas.",Fresh
Fans of Scarface and even Goodfellas will definitely get their thrills.,Fresh
As sensational as Scarface and a lot livelier than that Miami Vice movie.,Fresh
A hyperventilating account of the blood-drenched Miami drug culture in the 1970s and 80s.,Rotten
The only thing more boring than listening to someone on drugs may be listening to someone brag about how many drugs he used to sell.,Rotten
"Cocaine Cowboys is gleefully manipulative -- which is meant as a compliment. Edited for maximum impact, it packs the furious momentum and dramatic punch of a riveting feature film.",Fresh
"While the filmmakers clearly got a contact high from hearing all these war stories, most civilians will find a little of this goes a long way.",Rotten
"Through its use of archival news footage and contemporary interviews, Cocaine Cowboys proves to be an intoxicating exploration of Miami, the '80s cocaine trade and those who saw it all happen.",Fresh
"Cocaine Cowboys' pulpy entertainment value merely lures us into a grim, kaleidoscopic look at how one city was both destroyed and, ironically, eventually saved by some of the worst human beings to walk the Earth.",Fresh
It's a remarkable immersion in a world turned morally inside out.,Fresh
"Aiming for encyclopedic coverage of the drug epidemic and its effect on the city, Corben packs much too much into one movie.",Rotten
"At half the length it would have been twice as good, but nevertheless it stokes a nostalgia some may have for a magic period in Miami history when it was ever so briefly the American Casablanca.",Fresh
"After beginning at a healthy clip, the film becomes mired in endless remembrances of debaucheries past and Miami's descent into lawlessness.",Rotten
"This is an ugly film, but with an undeniable allure.",Fresh
"It's watchable, but like gorging on every rotten issue of the old Confidential magazine.",Rotten
Forget Scarface and Miami Vice. Cocaine Cowboys is the real deal -- a down-and-dirty look at the high living and illegal drugs that dominated south Florida in the 1980s.,Fresh
This documentary on Miami's lethal '80s cocaine scene is cut fast.,Rotten
"The Jan Hammer music on the soundtrack works overtime to assure us that Cocaine Cowboys is the real, nastier version of Miami Vice",Rotten
Cocaine Cowboys is a fascinating look at a time when Miami was so flush with cash from cocaine deals that it was completely buffered from a nationwide recession.,Fresh
"There's so much compelling material here, all of it salacious and dangerous and so enjoyable that you might just feel a little guilty afterward.",Fresh
Rich in detail and fascinating characters.,Fresh
"Fast-paced and fascinating, but a little too frenetic for its own good.",Fresh
"It's the sort of glamour-meets-violence drugs-crime story on which lads' mags thrive: unqualified, over-reverent and hysterical.",Rotten
"Grisly crime scene snaps accompany the story, which makes Miami Vice look like a tea party and Florida like hell on earth.",Rotten
The haystacks of cash and coke are laughably insane - as is the head-count: thousands of people were gunned to death. This is the only state in the world where Scarface might raise a smile.,Fresh
"At nearly two hours, Cocaine Cowboys (appropriately) doesn't know when to stop talking, but as a chronicle of a demented epoch, it's both entertaining and just about definitive.",Fresh
"Without narration, the doc has scant moral compass, its very title celebrating the machine gun-wielding mercenaries involved.",Fresh
Too often the film crosses the line between recording his subjects' illegal activities and aggrandising them.,Fresh
"With a nearly two-hour running time that includes its share of blowhards, repetition, and cheesy attempts to heighten drama, Cocaine Cowboys brings to mind an unfortunate comparison: Miami Vice. The movie.",Rotten
Documentarian Billy Corben's revealing film exposes the methods and players in South Florida's drug trade that literally built the city of Miami that we know today with billions of dollars in blood cash.,Fresh
Ropey graphics and sub-Scarface synth music simply add to the feeling that you're getting a low budget experience.,Rotten
A documentary examining the Miami drug wars of the early 1980s in exhaustive - and occasionally nauseating - detail.,Fresh
"In the end, the script lets the film down with its obvious twists, its naggingly illogical narrative and a general pointlessness.",Rotten
"A final reel of arterial spray splatter empties itself in record time and when Gone finally gets going, it's gone too soon.",Rotten
"You may be able to work out where it's going, but it's an enjoyable ride nonetheless.",Fresh
"You will be kept waiting for the twist that never comes in Ringan Ledwidge's derivative psycho-thriller, whose by-the-numbers plotting is as inevitable as roadkill.",Rotten
If only it had taken the characters' lead and strayed further from the beaten track...,Fresh
Gone but not forgotten.,Fresh
A potentially menacing first half is let down by a few cliches in the home stretch.,Fresh
First-time director Ringan Ledwidge conjures up an effectively creepy mood to accompany three young backpackers on an ill-fated road trip across the Aussie desert.,Fresh
"Solid direction and well shot visuals cannot overcome the inherent problems from the mixed performances, thin script, off-putting characterizations, and languished pacing",Rotten

[The] film is undeniably topical but the lack of emotional investment in its characters renders it more intelligent than engaging.,Rotten
"Had traces of human feeling, but [it's] mostly didactic.",Rotten
"Having served my duty by pointing out the main failures of the film, it's equally obligatory to say that by film's end you have a better understanding of the opposing interests that are deconstructing Iraq than media coverage conveys.",Rotten
"Part war drama, part political thriller, part romance -- and wholly uninvolving.",Rotten
"Though timely and relevant, Haas' war film, centering on American journalist (Connie Nielsen) investigating the death of a community figure, is a series of misfires (particularly the script) and blown opportunities",Rotten
Tackles its topical subject with lurching focus and plenty of from-the-mouths-of-mouthpieces didacticism.,Rotten
... an inevitably dated contemplation of the complexities of the American occupation of Iraq ...,Rotten
"Using handheld cameras throughout, 'The Situation' draws the eye down into the human pieces that will one day make up history-book summaries.",Fresh
"The Situation is, to put it kindly, a spotty piece of work.",Rotten
Awkward and half-digested.,Rotten
"Philip Haas's deftly paced, well-written, and brilliantly infuriating Iraq War thriller is not only the strongest of recent geopolitical hotspot flicks but one that has been designed for maximal agitation.",Fresh
"An overstuffed, unengaging drama.",Rotten
"Haas here imagines Iraq as the sun-bleached setting for an especially bleak film noir, in which love is treacherous, good intentions lead you-know-where and the line between good and evil is always shifting.",Fresh
Audiences expecting this film to wring any kind of order from the ongoing chaos may find that The Situation merely reflects this 'situation's' rat's-nest confusion and seeming hopelessness.,Fresh
"The situation in The Situation is grimly photogenic, yet persistently opaque.",Rotten
"While not easy to watch, and at times even harder to follow, Haas' film is an important attempt to accurately capture the confusing reality of contemporary Iraq.",Fresh
"The narrative has no direction. There is no central problem to be resolved, no goal to be reached.",Rotten
The gravitas that director Philip Haas and writer Wendell Steavenson would like to bring to bear in this smallish war thriller is simply not an achievable goal.,Rotten
A powerful story about a frustrated American journalist risking her life to develop sources among Iraqi citizens who themselves are risking their lives to talk to her.,Fresh
"[The Situation] plays like one long monologue, spread between a dozen characters.",Rotten
"Set in wartime Iraq, The Situation is exploitation cinema of the most narcoleptic kind.",Rotten
"The Situation is by no means a perfect movie, but it does tackle difficult issues and makes clear that there are no easy answers.",Fresh
A beautifully written and realized behind-the-scenes story aiming to make some sense of all the violence and chaos in Iraq today.,Fresh
"The Situation never fails to be illustrative, like in straight reporting, but at the expense of catharsis.",Rotten
The message is quite clear: We should withdraw our troops and let the Iraqis kill each other off.,Fresh
The super-accurate reportage may be lost when combined with the war-flick plot. Fact and fiction have different audiences.,Rotten
"It fails to strike an emotional chord, however, with a meandering narrative and heroes who spout rhetoric like pundits.",Rotten
"The Situation is promoting itself as the first American dramatic feature film to deal with the occupation of Iraq. While that may be true, it turns out not to matter that much.",Rotten
"The film would have made a serviceable drama, perhaps, if [writer] Steavenson and [director] Haas weren't so inured to trite utterances.",Rotten
"As ambitious in scope as it is interpretively timid, The Situation delivers the requisite incendiary climax, but collapses in on itself with daft speeches about the elusiveness of truth in something called 'the fourth dimension of time.'",Rotten
"It's [Wendell Steavenson] first screenplay, and it shows; while not the movie's only problem, the script is a big one, made up as it is primarily of dialogue that isn't just expository, but clunkily explanatory.",Rotten
"His heart is in the right place, and our current situation cries out for a film like this %u2026 like this, but much better made.",Rotten
The Situation does an admirable job of guiding us through an almost hopeless quagmire.,Fresh
"You want better for this film, but the discomfort it causes is not a matter of it being too soon for the audience, but rather, it seems, for the filmmakers.",Rotten
"Even as it makes a mucky melodrama out of the war in Iraq, this effect does not seem entirely inappropriate, as it accommodates a U.S. perspective of its own actions.",Fresh
"A gripping briefing on the post-Saddam morass of Iraq. The tactical calculus used by sheiks, insurgents, CIA operatives, soldiers, and civilians is ugly, but it's not inscrutable.",Fresh
"There are a half dozen people in colorful supporting roles all of whom have their own truths. And all of whom are far more interesting, as characters and actors, than [Connie Nielsen].",Rotten
"The Situation' is bound to stir up controversy because of the way Americans are portrayed, and anything that gets people talking and thinking is for the good. It brings the war home, where our soldiers should be.",Fresh
"It's a credit to the material and the basic plot that even as you're groaning over a clunky speech explaining it all, you're completely focused on what the situation in Iraq actually is.",Fresh
"[Haas'] attempt to convey the tangled relations between sheikhs and insurgents, occupiers and civilians is undercut by Wendell Steavenson's mightily overwritten screenplay.",Rotten
"Bringing the chaos down to very human terms redefines the paradigm for thinking about the occupation, and makes this a film that is more than a mere exercise in action/adventure",Fresh
The concept is strong and expertly fleshed out; it's just a pity that Hollywood tropes are allowed to invade.,Rotten
Beneath the melodrama is an insider's account of the seemingly inconsequential details often edited out of dispatches from the front.,Fresh
"The essential message in this strongly felt film comes clear: 'It's Iraq.' It used to be bad, but now it's worse. And anyone in his right mind, including Iraqis, wants to get out.",Fresh
"A pretty lousy movie in general, though it's the film's somewhat accusatory Iraq War subject matter that's getting it some attention -- deserved or not -- that makes the whole thing a little distasteful.",Rotten
"I don't think this movie sheds any new light on 'the situation', but it could have, and it's a shame that it didn't.",Rotten
"The film takes place in current day Iraq (although it was primarily filmed in Morocco) and it makes everybody out to be pathetic. And while this is a major problem, it is not even the film's greatest flaw.",Rotten
"Snow Blind calls itself a documentary, but it never stops feeling like the in-house channel on a ski-lodge television.",Rotten
"Though some of the action cinematography is stunning, and practicing snowboarders will love the sense of camaraderie established, it's not riveting entertainment for the rest of us.",Rotten
"It's understandable that Scott wants to highlight snowboarding's diversity, but perhaps a winter-sports documentary shouldn't try to cover the waterfront.",Rotten
"Where Snow Blind dazzles is in its generous serving of performance footage: Watching the devoted soar through the air, flipping and spinning with near-balletic skill, takes your breath away.",Fresh
"Christopher J. Scott's film chronicling the rise of one of the world's fastest-growing sport is best geared to fans, presenting those of us with merely a casual interest with far too much information and repetitive footage of snowboarders in action.",Rotten
A film with some wonderfuly oddball comedy while also being a very heart-felt statement about expanding on the person you are and finding your true voice.,Fresh

"John Boorman's self-indulgent ""moral fable"" has promise ..., but like the dueling entrepreneurs who populate one strand of the narrative, delivers more sizzle than steak.",Rotten
"Any potential in Boorman's sinister parable is frittered away with awkward dialogue, shallow characters and failed attempts at comedy. A curiosity at best.",Rotten
"Despite Boorman's subtle, suggestive direction and a nice central performance from Gleeson, this low-key thriller never quite works.",Rotten
"John Boorman's tale of doppelgngers in Dublin would like very much to spook us, but keeps tripping over its loose script and bizarre plot lines.",Rotten
"Not quite a car crash of a movie, Boorman's uneven black comedy is more like a fender-bender. It falls into the twilight zone between so bad it's good and so bad it's bad.",Rotten
"As tigers go, it's all growl and no teeth.",Rotten
"You get two Brendan Gleesons for the price of one in John Boorman's Dublin-set comedy, though neither is shown to his advantage in this uncomfortable mix of social satire and over-ripe melodrama.",Rotten
"Far from being a roaring, sinewy beast with a lot of bite that the title might suggest, John Boorman's latest has more in common with a lumbering white elephant.",Rotten
"An almost madcap comic pace battles with thundercloud-building drama . . . The social commentary can be earnest and bald, with the mythic overtones seemingly contrived to tumble O'Leary into the class gap on his arse.",Rotten
"If there's anything about the movie that really rises above the mediocre, it's Gleeson's fantastic performance.",Rotten
"The Tiger's Tail, like Cassandra's Dream, prominently features a boat that is both symbol of financial attainment and emotional ruin; it also finds a master filmmaker defying the ""show, don't tell"" principle with almost crippling cynicism.",Rotten
A real waste of a potentially interesting premise.,Rotten
"The world recession has made this suspenseful film bitingly relevant beyond the local problems of the maiming of ""The Celtic Tiger.""",Fresh
"Amateurish technical contrivance isn't this awkward, retro failure's only deficiency.",Rotten
A messy but absorbing mystery.,Fresh
The fanciful tale is too absurd to take seriously.,Rotten

There's actually some serious subtext if we bother to look for it.,Fresh

"Strangely enough, it isn't the lack of originality in this body switch comedy that irritated me most, it is that I didn't believe any of it.",Rotten
There's little doubt that Boy Girl Thing was assembled by someone who was obviously blindfolded and possibly drugged.,Rotten
All this movie needs is a choreographed dance number to complete the circle.,Rotten
As predictable as it is blatantly enjoyable.,Fresh
Raunchy teen comedy looks at gender roles; lots of cursing.,Fresh
[It] can either be viewed as one huge home movie or a plaything from an actor who has been observing other filmmakers for decades.,Rotten
"Hopkins' ambition is laudable, but what he has produced is a handsome, admirable failure, a labor of love and an extremely personal film with extremely limited appeal.",Rotten
"The veneer of stylistic hyperactivity can't conceal the starkly banal dialogue and a roster of performances that seem, under the circumstances, hardly directed at all.",Rotten
A visual masterpiece and an amazing achievement in cinematography and editing.,Fresh
"The resolution ties up enough loose ends to be satisfying, yet makes you think long after you've left the theater.",Fresh
"Annoying, pretentious twaddle of the highest order.",Rotten
"Hopkins' surreal take on the absurdist nature of movies--and reality--bears the traits of many works by actors-helmers: It's self-reflexive, whimsical in movieish way, and self-indulgent but it's never boring due to talent in front and behind the camera",Rotten
"An avante-garde, admittedly experimental, absurdist, through-the-looking-glass glimpse of behind-the-scenes movie-making, it's the Mad Hatter's Tea Party.",Fresh
"The editing-on-speed renders Hopkin's ""experiment"" inacessible to the degree that the movie will be lucky if it makes two cents.",Rotten
"Blaring its pretense to Lynch-ness, Slipstream crumbles under the weight of Hopkins's self-indulgence, yet there is some measure of sincerity to this senseless upchuck.",Rotten
"Hopkins claims it's a comedy, and perhaps John Turturro's live-action cartoon of a mogul producer suggests so, but what does it all mean? That art can be just as shallow as Hollywood?",Rotten
"I'm a sucker for this sort of narrative playfulness, so I fully enjoyed Slipstream. Perhaps it's best thought of as Inland Empire Lite: At half the length, it's easier going down but less filling.",Fresh
Even second-rate David Lynch and third-rate Federico Fellini is worth our attention.,Fresh
"If consummate thespian Anthony Hopkins downplays, even dismisses, discussions about the ""craft"" of acting, then Slipstream, only the second film he's directed, betrays evidence that it's a subject to which he's nevertheless given a lot of thought.",Rotten
"Either one of the most self-indulgent vanity projects in the history of the Hollywood star system, or a rare revealing look at a distinguished actor who usually keeps his real self out of the spotlight.",Rotten
"Slipstream is bold, experimental, off-the-wall kicky and utterly exasperating.",Rotten
"Stylish attempt at Hopkins visualizing post-traumatic Hollywood syndrome, but there should be a rule that movies helmed by movie stars turned directors need to come with some sort of equivalent of the Surgeon General warning label.",Rotten
"Say this much for Anthony Hopkins' project: If he's going to indulge himself as a writer-director-star, it's probably better that he goes completely off the wall.",Rotten
"I'm glad that Hopkins has apparently been using the bland, middlebrow stage of his acting career to experiment with massive doses of psychotropic chemicals and open the doors of perception and all that. Next time, maybe he'll just write a manifesto.",Rotten
A fever dream as much about life and death as the experience of making a movie and watching one.,Fresh
Straight-up bonkers.,Rotten
[S]o fascinating a failure that it's worth seeing...,Fresh
"If not exactly dull, Hopkins' stream-of-consciousness rant is nonetheless self-indulgent and crammed with bits of business that never add up to anything much.",Rotten
Slipstream ultimately winds up an avant-garde film that just ain't all that avant.,Rotten
"At 96 minutes, this vanity/insanity project runs a bit long; five minutes would have been plenty.",Rotten
"Slipstream is an experiment in visual stream-of-consciousness, but stream-of-consciousness fares better as a literary form than a cinematic one.",Rotten
"Anthony Hopkins wrote and directed Slipstream. It's a free-form, surreal meditation on stuff that, evidently, popped into Hopkins' head while he was writing.",Rotten
"Has one trick up its sleeve, and once that trick is revealed, the film collapses in on itself in a manner that will irritate more viewers than it intrigues.",Rotten
"...makes you long for a pretentious, arty student short. Because those are only about eight minutes long.",Rotten
Leave it to a 69-year-old actor to make the year's most experimental film.,Fresh
Slipstream is Anthony Hopkins's third film as a director and his first as a quasi-avant-garde filmmaker working well outside the mainstream.,Rotten
A miserable mess of a stream-of-consciousness movie.,Rotten
"What would have perhaps made an excellent short subject becomes a cumbersome, confusing and deeply unsatisfying mess of a vanity project.",Rotten
A Hopkins personal vanity project,Rotten
Slipstream is utterly unwatchable. I hated every minute of it.,Rotten
Alternately interesting and unwatchable.,Rotten
"Slipstream meanders into some lucidity by film's end, but it remains difficult to determine if it's a work born of genius or madness. The decision lies with the viewer.",Fresh
"Just when you're sure you know how Delirious is going to close, DiCillo comes up with a capper that's as satisfying as it is understated.",Fresh
"A joyously raucous, sexy, deliciously biting fable...Delirious is superbly entertaining and completely satisfying",Fresh
No one is spared in this whip-smart comedy about the entertainment industry.,Fresh
"The story's surprises range from clever to annoying, but [director] DiCillo manages to hold it all together with his consistently amusing cast members, who make you laugh at their characters' self-absorbed folly.",Fresh
"A high-energy rags-to-riches satire about a deranged New York paparazzo and a wannabe thesp, Delirious is hilarious.",Fresh
"Buscemi again proves himself one of our great character actors in the role of a paparazzo who feels regularly betrayed--by his parents, by the celebrities, and by a homeless kid he helps.",Fresh
"One of those savvy, low-budget crowd-pleasers that arrive in local theaters only via film festivals like San Sebastian and Sundance.",Fresh
"While Delirious doesn't have the sophistication of DiCillo's Living in Oblivion, nor the biting wit of The Real Blonde, it's still worth a look for those who enjoy the entertainment industry's POV.",Fresh
"A poignant satire of the national craze of celeb culture, with a touching buddy tale at its center, well played by Michael Pitt and particularly Steve Buscemi, who dominates every scene he's in.",Fresh
"With Delirious, Tom DiCillo puts our national obsession with fame under the magnifying glass, and what he spies is a bunch of people in desperate need of attention, approval, and friendship.",Fresh
The movie is exhilarating in a way that only hard-won knowledge of the world can be.,Fresh
"Off beat in the best sense of the term; surprisingly successful with a theme that could easily have gone down the gully hole of corn; ""Delirious"" delivers.",Fresh
"Tom DiCillo's Delirious is a mild Midnight Cowboy, a minor King of Comedy, and mainly a vehicle for Steve Buscemi as a lower Manhattan-based paparazzo.",Fresh
"In the end, I don't know that Delirious has all that much to say about the fame game, but you'll laugh nonetheless.",Fresh
"The prickly camaraderie between Buscemi and Pitt puts Delirious back on track, abetted by a hilarious turn by Gina Gershon.",Fresh
"Despite some plot holes, Delirious hits the bull's-eye with razor-sharp performances and dialogue.",Fresh
Tom DiCillo‚Äôs angry comedy Delirious subjects modern celebrity culture to a microscopic examination that shows the toxic virus of fame squirming under its lens.,Rotten
"The overall, overstressed tone is one of cynical whimsy meant to be incisively hard-hitting, but more often coming off as merely tiresome and abrasive.",Rotten
It's an achingly funny film that is also a little sad around the edges.,Fresh
"The film's got some good, amusing moments and, perhaps, an insight or two into hanger-on psychology.",Fresh
"Too many different stories are vying for attention here, and none of them are very good.",Rotten
"There's enough retro modern social satire here to support the comical efforts of a talented cast adding layers of emotional nuance. Alison Lohman (""White Oleander"") remains a rising star with yet another inspired performance that surprises and charms.",Fresh
"Delirious, is among DiCillo's best, and returns to the central theme of his career: the elusive and destructive nature of fame.",Fresh
"Short, sharp snapshot about celebrity and life on the fringe has nothing new to say, but it says it with considerable charm and affection.",Fresh
"At once chaotic, moody, outrageous, ridiculous and deeply tragic, Delirious reaches way beyond Buscemi's wacko rabbit hole excursion into the fetid, goofy shallow heart of celebrity glitz.",Fresh
"Delirious is a funny, insightful, entertaining poke at celebrity culture that lands quite a few notches above the typical, New York-set ensemble indie.",Fresh
Buscemi makes this pathetic and potentially lethal shutterbug a figure of surprising humor and compassion.,Fresh
"There are some hilarious scenes here, and some moments so sad they'll make you wince.",Fresh
"A lark, a fairy tale, a tantalizing mix between John Scheslinger's much darker Midnight Cowboy and John Water's ultra sweet Pecker.",Fresh
"It would be nice to see a sharp, funny, penetrating satire of the new, kicked-up culture of empty media fame, but Tom DiCillo's scattershot buddy movie Delirious isn't it.",Rotten
"DiCillo gets at how celebrity culture can erode a person's dignity and self-worth, and Buscemi's performance strikes just the right note between unctuous bottom-feeder and loveable loser. It's unfortunate that the rest of the movie tends to get too glib.",Rotten
"In spite of the off-tone moments and thematic distractions, Delirious is engaging, intelligent and enjoyable.",Fresh
A prickly look at the poisonous nature of celebrity and the unsavory subculture it breeds around the edges.,Fresh
"Delirious, by writer-director Tom DiCillo, has a special quality because it does not make paparazzi a target but a subject.",Fresh
"...it depends so consistently on plot contrivances and other movies (The King of Comedy,Midnight Cowboy, even All About Eve) that it often comes across as wannabe muckraking.",Rotten
"Someday, far in the future, a team of archeologists will dig up the black, wizened, still beating heart of New York City, and it will look exactly like Steve Buscemi.",Fresh
"Tom DiCillo's Delirious, from his own screenplay, presents a paparazzo's worm's-eye view of the ridiculous world of celebrity culture.",Fresh
A great romp with both Steve Buscemi and Michael Pitt having the time of their lives. Especially fun to see Pitt do something completely different.,Fresh
"DiCillo finds comedy in the tragic, depth in the shallowness, and surprises in the clich",Fresh
DiCillo's spot-on writing -- and the exceptional performances by Buscemi and Pitt -- creates a touching and vivid friendship that stabilizes the film.,Fresh
"With Delirious, writer-director Tom DiCillo has crafted a wonderfully giddy meditation on the nature of fame, the people who sell it and those doing the buying, and their mutually parasitic dependence on each other.",Fresh
"The jokes are sparse and predictable, and the storytelling is, too. But Buscemi and Gershon have great fun with their roles, and Pitt is strangely agreeable about the whole thing.",Fresh
"The movie is a provocative little pleasure, and the gleefully vile Buscemi and dreamy-eyed Pitt make a fine 21st-century odd couple.",Fresh
"I just wish you'd get the chance to see it in a theater like I did, because if more people took the time to do so then maybe we might actually get more intelligently crafted relationship comedies like it.",Fresh
"DiCillo is ultimately grounded in the eccentric, awkward relationship",Fresh
"As always, Buscemi masters his portrayal of needy desperation, but he still makes Les admirable for his capacity to go with the flow.",Fresh
Mature paparazzi drama isn't quite in focus.,Rotten
"This satirical comedy is a connoisseur's delight, with Steve Buscemi in top form as the runt of a paparazzo who tries to exploit a homeless young man.",Fresh
"For all its time-worn situations and observations, Delirious has a truth or two to impart about our lust for celebrities.",Fresh
A victim of its own vitriol.,Rotten
"DiCillo hasn't lost his gift for artfully skewering both those basking in fame's spotlight and those lurking in the shadows, while still finding a measure of affection for all of them.",Fresh
DiCillo's themes are loyalty and friendship and betrayal and redemption.,Fresh
"Underwritten and overplayed, it is one that not even Buscemi fans will treasure.",Rotten
"The film isn't as broadly funny as the previous DiCillo-Buscemi collaboration Living in Oblivion, but its outsiders peering in have an uncomfortable resonance.",Fresh
"It's not as sharp as his indie gems from the mid-1990s, but the thing's packed with bright performances and unique characters, which is what DiCillo does best.",Fresh
Leaves us with the same old familiar and empty Hollywood storyline on the world of celebrity culture.,Fresh
Steve Buscemi and Michael Pitt are easily the best odd couple the movies have seen since Walter Matthau and Jack Lemmon.,Fresh
"Delirious is definitive DiCillo: goofy and cartoonish at the edges, at times a little obvious in its caricature of our celebrity-obsessed culture, but humble and funny enough to compel viewers to overlook its flaws.",Fresh
Delirious sizzles as long as it loiters in the R. Crumb universe of geeky losers who keep their homicidal urges at least barely in check.,Fresh
Steve Buscemi's adaptation preserves the original's biting basic scenario while adding a few Americanizing tweaks to this tale.,Fresh
"To their credit, Miller and Buscemi engage the audience's interest in what is essentially an extended conversation.",Fresh
"While it is never dull, and occasionally sparks, material fails to ignite.",Rotten
"It is a smart film in its humor, its subject, and its execution. Van Gogh could not have done better himself, and that is perhaps the best possible homage to this fallen artist.",Fresh
"Buscemi's adaptation of slain director Theo van Gogh's 2003 film aims to be a sexually and emotionally charged drama about power games, but the execution leaves much to be desired.",Rotten
"No surprise that Buscemi can carry off this kind of performance, but Miller holds up her end, and is a magnificent tease.",Fresh
"Interview can be a harrowing experience, but it's a highly skilled, emotionally gripping one.",Fresh
"Interview is chiefly a showcase for actors Steve Buscemi and Sienna Miller, as well as a case study in how to cinematically cope with stagy material.",Fresh
"This toxic hate at first sight sly entrapment is a deliciously wicked concoction of mutual suspicion, contempt and above all fame game obsessive co-dependency that exists between the worlds of entertainment and the corporate media.",Fresh
The least concrete and most artificial of Buscemi's films. But that's as much because of the situation as Buscemi and David Schechter's slippery script.,Rotten
Charms in large part due to the performances of the two stars.,Fresh
Driven by a really smart script and strong performances by one of the most unlikely film pairings in many years.,Fresh
"This veneer of pseudo-adult psychological realism doesn't stop the film from being trashy, awkward and implausible, something like a stage play that might have seemed challenging in 1976.",Rotten
Any doubts as to whether Sienna Miller is a gifted actress should be laid to rest by Interview.,Fresh
"You won't be able to take your eyes off the screen as this terrific psychological game of cat and mouse unfolds. The incredibly sexy Sienna Miller burns up the screen with raw, sensual star power. She's hot",Fresh
"It's mesmerizing on multiple levels, and by the time it was over the fun I was having was so palpable I'm sure it was showing all over my body.",Fresh
"Sprawling its intriguing capital in all directions, Interview falls short even in reaching that commonest of denominators: the cinematic puff piece.",Rotten
hums with life,Fresh
"Premise of the Dutch film's remake seems less believable here, but the acting is compelling and believable.",Fresh
"The back-and-forth between the performers is tensely choreographed, and Buscemi does a good job opening up the action, which mostly takes place in a Manhattan loft.",Fresh
"Buscemi's Interview moves forward in static bursts that are contained by the avid, yet unobtrusive direction and the intensity of the two principals.",Fresh
"Interview doesn't say anything new regarding our obsession with celebrity or, to paraphrase Janet Malcolm, the moral indefensibility of journalism. But the way [Buscemi and Miller] psychologically thrust and parry more than carries the film.",Fresh
"Since this unconvincing, contrived imitation only runs less than 90 minutes, the last half, combined with Sienna Miller's stunning beauty, almost makes it worth seeing.",Rotten
"Interview is mannered, implausible, and stagy, but queasily compelling all the same.",Fresh
"Pierre is such a weasel, Katya is such a narcissist and the outcome seems so pre-determined, it's hard to care whose belt gets the notch. The adroit performances of Buscemi and Miller almost make it matter.",Rotten
"Director Steve Buscemi is not to be faulted for his filmmaking or acting skills, but as co-writer he could have done better than the false-sounding dialogue.",Rotten
There's nothing more to it than meets the eye.,Rotten
"Buscemi creates an intriguing, if contrived, drama about the battle of the sexes.",Rotten
"Miller is so good -- dumb, smart, wounded, wounding, a lollipop of sweet poison that you'd buy every day until it killed you -- that you feel you not only understand her but all actresses.",Fresh
"Buscemi can play a hangdog cynic better than anyone, and Miller seizes her opportunity to express every emotion an actress can be asked to express.",Fresh
"Interview is literate, well-paced and played at perfect pitch by Sienna Miller and director Steve Buscemi. I didn't buy it for more than two minutes.",Rotten
"Vaporous and chilled to freezing, Interview lacks a single honest moment, but it does have plenty of diverting ones.",Fresh
Buscemi's strength is his build up of the characters and he does well as both director and star.,Fresh
"At film's end, we happily say adieu to a pair who deserve each other more than they imagine.",Rotten
"Though the pic is as talky as anything by Erich Rohmer,the dialogue is riveting.",Fresh
"I frankly could not care about either of the people on screen. She comes off as a spoiled, manipulative and nasty woman and he is equally repellent.",Rotten
"Steve Buscemi and Sienna Miller exude a raw sensuality in this steamy, character-driven drama which unfolds like a cross between Sleuth and Swept Away. Who'd ever expect to hear 'Steve Buscemi' and 'raw sensuality' in the same sentence?",Fresh
"I've sat through so many claustrophobic examples of the genre I forgot how exhilarating, how pure a great one could be. Interview is a great one -- electric as theater and cinema.",Fresh
"""Interview"" is an actor's showcase movie that could, and should, have been made by a couple of talented student actors trying to break out of their off-off Broadway gigs.",Rotten
"There's no doubting that the two actors, whose exchanges carry the script to its deceitful ending, generate spectacular chemistry.",Fresh
Van Gogh has now received the most profound posthumous tribute that the American film industry could possibly bestow with this tepid and only fitfully interesting remake of his own 2003 feature of the same name.,Rotten
"An entertaining two-person talkfest ... with nice ending twists are like frosting on a fluffy cake -- not really necessary, but tasty nonetheless.",Fresh
"The results may not seem to be taking place on planet Earth among verifiable humans, but, taken in the spirit of gladiatorial battle, the film is often fascinating.",Fresh
"Tension, humor and pathos are wrung out from smart scripting and surprisingly effective performances.",Fresh
Has the kind of insight you won't find in Us Weekly.,Fresh
"The most impressive thing about Interview is how much shock it manages to muster over the walloping nonrevelation that, now more than ever, hype begets headlines. Next up: the rich are getting richer!",Rotten
"Despite the fact that both protagonists are equally appalling, the screenplay seems to have a soft spot for the woman. However, this doesn't take away from the fun of watching the two characters tear each other to pieces.",Fresh
Sharp dialogue and good performances keep it interesting. The film suggests a level of talent in Sienna Miller that she rarely gets a chance to show.,Fresh
Any questions about Miller's abilities as an actress should be set to rest by this performance.,Fresh
"Despite a few interesting twists and ambiguities, the main revelation -- that the reporter is an insufferable snob -- doesn't seem worth the 84 minutes devoted to spelling it out.",Rotten
"Kind of fascinating, especially in the ways that Buscemi and Miller make their performances into commentaries on the types of characters they play. When actors are really turned loose to play actors, they can achieve merciless accuracy.",Fresh
"Ultimately, pointless. One comes away from Interview exhausted.",Rotten
"Though I'm not familiar with Van Gogh's 2003 version, Buscemi's is implausible and even irritating, despite some nice atmospherics and a decent performance by the director.",Rotten
"The end result of this showcase for Buscemi's writing, acting and directing chops is so uneven and mixed in small details and overall tone that it's anybody's guess if it's one for the Oscars or the Razzies next year.",Rotten
"As the action moves from the restaurant and ultimately to Katja's spacious loft apartment, Interview becomes a house guest who has worn out his welcome.",Rotten
Too bad the touted twist at the end is telegraphed miles in advance.,Rotten
Steve Buscemi is a multi-talented craftsman consistently putting out good work.,Fresh
"A verbal game of one-upmanship that occasionally gets physical, but with an undertone of constantly smoldering sexuality.",Fresh
"A bitter, darkly funny little slice of arsenic, with some of the most stinging dialogue since Closer.",Fresh
"The dialogue cuts like a knife, and the two lead performances, by Steve Buscemi and Sienna Miller, have an electrifying emotional focus -- neither actor has ever been more mesmerizing.",Fresh
Mr. Buscemi and Ms. Miller prove that they are fully up to the task of carrying a whole movie on their shoulders without any help from the other characters.,Fresh
"Like a one-act off-Broadway play that's wandered onto the movie screen...a sporadically amusing talkathon, but a pretty shallow and forgettable one.",Rotten
"Interview is less like a realistic character study than a theatrical game of cat-and-mouse, and a well-played one at that.",Fresh
A few scenes crackle with... intensity. The rest of it wallows in glib acrimony and cynicism.,Rotten
"Interview slyly keeps you watching, wondering who will emerge from this long night's journey.",Fresh
"For starters, Buscemi is woefully miscast. The movie needed Anthony Quinn, not Peter Lorre.",Rotten
An eminently watchable contest between two actors at the top of their games.,Fresh
The subject matter is certainly American enough.,Fresh
"I'll just say that Buscemi, who also directed and co-wrote, knows a lot about making movies but little about journalism.",Rotten
Interview has its moments but they can't prevent it from feeling a little long winded and unsatisfying. The premise makes it sound more interesting than the in-theater experience delivers.,Rotten
"A thoughtful, challenging piece of work.",Fresh
"What they're doing is so uninteresting, and their characters so unlikable, that it becomes an exercise in futility.",Rotten
"Stick with it for Miller's gutsy tour de force and the kick of watching Buscemi, as actor and filmmaker, turn an experiment into a mesmerizing battle of wills.",Fresh
Buscemi's film conveys the spirit of its source material but doesn't make a satisfying transmogrification out of its homage.,Rotten
"Miller delivers her strongest yet performance in this offbeat black comedy, which [is] intriguing, but a little draggy.",Fresh
This movie keeps falling out of rhythm just when it should be picking up pace. It's a fitful piece of wrong beginnings and false ends.,Rotten
"Interview feels more like a lab experiment/tribute than a committed, personal drama, leaving us with the sense that Buscemi wanted to feel more connected to this material than he actually did.",Rotten
"A mixed bag of realism and arch, dramatic exaggeration.",Rotten
"After some impressive banter that hints at interesting character insights, the film loses steam at the halfway mark.",Rotten
"In revealing the reporter and star's many efforts at artifice and incapacity for truth, Interview tells a conventional story, after all.",Fresh
"Interview is smart, provocative and disturbing, a searing indictment of media, hypocrisy and the themes Theo Van Gogh explored in his original.",Fresh
Buscemi and Miller should be roundly praised for the acting chops they display in this thriller.,Fresh
"Interview, a mood swing of a film with a trap-door resolution, is never much more than an elliptical exercise in symbiotic insincerity.",Rotten
"A battle of who couldn't care less in which two parties' disinterest collides into a spark-filled festival of mutual loathing, attempted manipulation and resentment.",Fresh
"Remaking a 2003 original by the slain Dutch director Theo van Gogh, Buscemi has produced a charmingly perplexing portrait that's anything but a knockoff.",Rotten
"There is something perversely appealing about this film. Maybe it's the way Interview astutely comments on celebrities and our perceptions of them, as well as questioning the sincerity and truthfulness of the media.",Fresh
"There's just one hysterical scene after another, ideal for an acting class but off-putting over the course of even a relatively short film like this one.",Rotten
"Emotional honesty in the service of nonsense is still nonsense, no matter how many scabs it manages to pick at.",Rotten
A one-act play in search of a black box theater and an audience unfamiliar with such intense cat-and-mouse character studies as 'Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?',Rotten
"There is precious damn little about watching a reporter and an actress trying to outsmart each other that could possibly be described as ""compelling.""",Rotten
"With her performance in Interview, Sienna Miller does more for today's tabloid-fixture starlets than they'll ever do for themselves.",Fresh
Rainer Werner Fassbinder might have been able to make us care for these characters; Buscemi and Miller are only able to get us to concede their chops.,Rotten
Works better in concept than execution.,Rotten
Stagey but enjoyable drama with superb performances from its two leads.,Fresh
Media foes face off in intense indie adult drama.,Fresh
"Interview isn't essential viewing, but it has a message for the media and its audience worth absorbing.",Fresh
"Pretty far from being a great movie, but it's not without its pleasures -- mostly due to the performers.",Fresh
"Ultimately, this two-hander feels limited in scale, but frisky and diverting while it's on.",Fresh
"As an exercise in preconception-shattering, it works reasonably well. But as the characters veer between petulance and intimacy and back again - often within the same verbal exchange - the situation never really rings true.",Rotten
"Stagey filming aside, this is a sharp and controlled study of celebrity obsession.",Fresh
"Interview is well-made but depends almost entirely on its acting. Neither of the two principals let it down, even when the screenplay isn't quite as sharp as it could have been.",Fresh
Sienna Miller as an airhead celeb more famous for her sex life than her movies? Quite a stretch for the British actress.,Fresh
"It pretends to be about the games of deceit that go on between men and women, but it's really just a squib on the culture of celebrity, and the cynical conclusion that's meant to pull us up short is feeble and silly beyond patience.",Rotten
"The friskiness of this pas de deux is something, and the acting duet enough of a selling point.",Fresh
"A talky, tricksy but never particularly convincing or involving drama.",Rotten
"There can hardly be a bigger waste of time than this conceited and self-indulgent two-hander directed by Steve Buscemi, remade from a Theo Van Gogh film.",Rotten
"Sienna does a good job of portraying Katya as a blonde, self-obsessed actress who is good at turning on the tears. Remarkable that.",Fresh
The constant see-sawing of emotion eventually becomes repetitive and wearisome.,Rotten
"There's some nicely written dialogue in this remake of a foreign movie, but it's all extremely unsatisfying thanks to a so-what? ending and the script's inability to make us warm to its two principal characters.",Fresh
"Snappy exchanges, smart acting and slick directing go to make up a wickedly entertaining work that's hugely enjoyable. A deft story about modern-day celebrity culture, it also proves what a talent Buscemi is as a director.",Fresh
Interview is a decently acted two-hander fringe play that doesn't deserve to be on film.,Rotten
"Essentially it's a game of verbal ping-pong and, even if cynicism wins the day too easily in the end, the interplay is lively and intriguing.",Fresh
"Interview is a decent showcase for the talents of its stars, but may leave you in doubt over the talents of its originator. Hopefully the other Van Gogh remakes in production will sport more smartness and subtlety.",Rotten
"The wonderful thing about Interview is that we have no idea where it is going to lead. It's honest, conflicted and surprising, as journalist and actress battle words and emotions in a potent drama that takes us to unexpected places",Fresh
I can't get on the Sienna Miller bandwagon. I can damn with faint praise: she's perfectly competent as an actor -- but that's it.,Rotten
"From its opening frame to its final revelation, Interview hums with life.",Fresh
Interview comes across more like an acting exercise than a workable story.,Rotten
"Even the smart ending feels predictable once it's happened: ""Move along,"" it seems to say, just like those New York cops. ""There's nothing to see here.""",Rotten
"The movie really started off on a good note, but then it just got repetitive.",Rotten
The resulting film is a boring hour-and-a-half of watching two immature adults sink down to the Lord of the Flies lowest for no reason and hurl bile and vitriol at each other.,Rotten
A surprising plot. [Full review in Spanish],Fresh
"A large portion of the movie is given over to gymnastics competitions, which are not explained or photographed well enough to be very interesting.",Rotten
This is an odd and unbelievably bad movie.,Rotten
"Hey, you got your gymnastics in my after-school special!",Rotten
This whole movie may have been concocted on a synthesizer.,Rotten
"Cast and crew are guided by the director from manipulative cliche to manipulative cliche, as everyone tries his or her best to overlook the fact that Gaylord, despite his athletic prowess, has little or no show-business talent.",Rotten
The characters are laughable; the gymnastics are unattractive. There is nothing to recommend this film.,Rotten
"It's a pretty ridiculous story, and screenwriters Evan Archerd and Jeff Benjamin never figure out a way to generate any real suspense, drama or inspiration.",Rotten
"Unfortunately, as far as acting exercises go, Gaylord couldn't score a 5.",Rotten
"Essentially, American Anthem is an idea in search of a screenplay,",Rotten
It's another example of how our most popular art form has been taken possession by what appear to be extraterrestrial moviemakers from the planet Stallone.,Rotten
"There hasn't been this much raw energy in a film since Rocky. On the other hand all that kinetic force is totally unfocused, leaving a pastiche of undirected elements that never forms a convincing whole.",Rotten
"American Anthem employs some flashy and occasionally effective visuals, but its screenplay and characterization leave much to be desired.",Rotten
"Uneven but often hilarious. Bad-taste quotient is cranked up here, ditto the overall conceptual giddiness.",Fresh
"Hilarious stuff, though many of the segments go on too long, so that the gags tend to wear out their welcome.",Fresh
"I discovered a solid handful of worthwhile chuckles in the flick, most of which came from the smoothly reliable Paul Rudd and the still-adorable Winona Ryder.",Fresh
"90 minutes of random, really bad sketch comedy.",Rotten
"Let's talk about Paul Rudd. I think he may be in every film in 2007 and that's okay by me, because Paul Rudd has become an acting Man-God.",Fresh
"The product of restless comic imaginations that would rather bounce to the next idea than milk the previous one for every drop. Some viewers may be exhausted by the barrage, but few will complain of not getting their money's worth.",Fresh
"The Ten, admittedly, is not Krzysztof Kieslowski's Decalogue. [Director] Wain's pieces are just jumping-off points for screwball improv and inspired throwaways.",Fresh
"Many of the films have little to do with the Commandments, and none has anything provocative or profound to say about them.",Rotten
One problem: The movie's just not funny.,Rotten
Any film that casts Oliver Platt as an Arnold Schwarzenegger impersonator and takes the name of Dianne Wiest in vain gets my vote.,Fresh
"This anthology promises to be wild and blasphemous, but only three episodes are funny or witty (the usual problem with compilations); the all-star cast, particularly Paul Rudd and Winona Ryder, is good.",Rotten
"The Ten is, I guess, sacrilegious in the strictest sense of the term, and its interest in investigating the commandments can be skin deep, as they're often used as mere pretext for ribald nonsense.",Fresh
"The Ten's biggest letdown are the interstitial sequences featuring Paul Rudd, [who is] usually the best thing about some of the worst movies.",Rotten
"Anytime you compile a series of vignettes and call it a feature film, you're going to have hits and misses. It's the nature of the structure.",Rotten
"Lacking a steady hand, this flimsy amalgam of bad jokes is without form and void.",Rotten
"A slightly patchy tapestry that tickles about as much as it annoys, full of unexpected laughs but also some torturous dead spots.",Rotten
"Despite many giddy moments, the conceit becomes gradually more exhausting, until somewhere around the seventh commandment you're ready to choose God's wrath over any more overproduced, A-list-acted throwaway TV sketches.",Rotten
"a foul-mouthed, dirty-as-diapers, Republican-baiting retelling of the Ten Commandments",Fresh
"Where Kieslowski's work always had a goal and a sense for how real people think, nothing about The Ten suggests that the filmmakers ever thought any further than the next meager, uncomfortable titter.",Rotten
It doesn't make for much of a movie.,Rotten
"Like the comic masterpieces of [Woody] Allen's '70s heyday, the first five short films represent a brilliant, laugh-out-loud combination of grad-school braininess and vaudeville goofiness, highbrow absurdity and lowbrow shtick.",Fresh
"In spite of its shortcomings, ""The Ten"" is an inspired and imaginative bellwether for where modern American comic sensibilities lay at the moment. It pushes the envelope in all of the right ways.",Fresh
You really have to be in the mood to get into The Ten's forced goofiness.,Rotten
"Apart from an occasional bright line and amusing throwaway bits of business, the humor here is juvenile and flat...The Ten is at best a five.",Rotten
The Ten never breaks out of jejune noodling and into something truly provocative.,Rotten
"For Bible-related fun, The Ten is at least a higher power than Evan Almighty.",Fresh
The success (of each sketch) varies not just according to quality but how tickled you find yourself -- from moment to moment -- by this kind of high-wire comedy.,Fresh
Everyone involved seems to have been operating from the presumption that gross and blasphemous equals hilarious. Would that it did.,Rotten
A lame and irritating comedy that is an endurance test to sit through.,Rotten
"Not so much blasphemous as it is very silly, and it lives up to the one unbendable commandment of comedy: It's funny.",Fresh
A resoundingly mediocre film that commits the cardinal sin of tedium.,Rotten
It's more a frivolous spoof than a pointed satire.,Rotten
"Multi-segment movies tend to be notoriously uneven, and this definitely proves to be the case with The Ten.",Rotten
"The Ten is so proud of its own wit and irreverence that when you fail to be equally impressed, you are likely to wonder if your own sense of humor is, in some way, deficient. Rest assured it is not.",Rotten
"Too often, The Ten is simply not funny enough, stretched thin by ideas played out too long.",Rotten
Darkly satiric.,Fresh
"In other words, I hated it, and if there are a better three words in the English language to adequately explain my feelings I must admit I have not yet been able to find them.",Rotten
...never fully takes advantage of its biblical premise.,Rotten
"A Decalogue for special-ed students, The Ten leans too often toward the bizarre and the bewildering.",Rotten
"This is one of those films where the humor is of the hit-and-miss variety, and it misses more often than it hits. The jokes are transparent. It's not difficult to divine what's supposed to be funny.",Rotten
"I wish that the batting average in The Ten was a little higher, but I'm happy that Wain and Marino got up to the plate and knocked a few out of the park.",Fresh
It is as if the filmmakers created an 11th commandment of their own: Thou Shalt Not Laugh. And we don't.,Rotten
"The Ten may be the funniest movie of the year. It's so earnest, they follow the most ridiculous threads to the logical extreme. All of the characters are completely committed to the reality of the film.",Fresh
"It's not an ice-water shock that The Ten turns out to be merely the fuse to a satirical firecracker that never quite explodes. What did we expect, Kryzsztof Kieslowski's The Dekalog as a comedy?",Rotten
"The comedy itself is hit or miss -- mostly hit for me, but humor is incredibly subjective, and this style of humor is particularly prone to the 'either you like it or you don't' effect.",Fresh
"The humor in The Ten is hit-or-miss, with some of the comedy and performances feeling kind of forced. Still, if you're in the mood for an unconventional Sunday school lesson, go see The Ten, ""as a goof""!",Fresh
"The actors are so good, and so funny.",Fresh
The Ten is devious and inspired enough to juice you past any weak spots. Thou shalt be amused.,Fresh
It never really quite works up the energy to be as wild and outrageous as it clearly wants to be.,Rotten
"This is a take it or leave it proposition, but worth a place on your NetFlix queue.",Fresh
"The problem here is that I harbor the quaint idea that comedy needs to make you laugh. And, sorry, if this makes you laugh, you're either high or easy or both.",Rotten
"By flaunting its own stupidity, The Ten practically dares you not to laugh at it, like a stand-up comic who sells an unfunny joke through the ferocity of his delivery.",Rotten
Perhaps the Bible needs an 11th Commandment: Thou Shalt Not Bore. That might stem misfires such as The Ten.,Rotten
"If there were Ten Commandments for filmmaking, one would certainly be: Thou shalt not pass off sketch comedy as a feature film, especially when charging $9 a ticket.",Rotten
The Ten is nowhere near a 10. Let's call it a six.,Rotten
"The Ten has a meticulous rhythm and consistency, with aspects of early commandments informing the latter.",Fresh
"The Ten commits the mortal sin of comedy, it's simply not funny. It thinks that just being crude or extreme is enough to merit the label of comedy.",Rotten
Where is Monty Python when you need them?,Rotten
"...The Ten wields its bad taste like a blunt instrument, bludgeoning you with buffoonery that's hard to resist.",Fresh
"Not exactly the stone-etched last word on biblical moviemaking, The Ten at least has a rare flair for the non sequitur, and a sassy, spasmodic charm.",Fresh
"There is a fun film in there somewhere, especially for those who know what they're getting into and are willing to just go with it. If you're not bothered by naked men frolicking and jokes about prison rape, then this is the film for you.",Rotten
"Yeah we liked this movie (with our self-proclaimed warped senses of humor), but we KNOW it's not for everyone, so thou shalt not blame us if you don't enjoy it as much as we did.",Fresh
"Thou shalt be funny. Thou, in this case, isn't.",Rotten
"Wain is a big fan of offbeat, exaggerated humor that either hits so big you think he's a genius or misses so badly you wonder whether he's sane.",Rotten
As ridiculous as it is uproariously funny.,Fresh
"Any of the film's concepts would be pretty funny in a tossed-off 'Saturday Night Live' skit, but presenting these absurdist ideas in the context of an impeccably produced albeit low-budget motion picture somehow sucks the comic air from the room.",Rotten
"If you're looking for ha-ha funny, then The Ten is probably not for you -- you'll be more likely scratching your head in befuddled wonderment.",Rotten
"Those worried about incurring God's wrath by seeing The Ten, don't concern yourselves -- by watching the film, you've suffered enough.",Rotten
we leave the theater feeling like we've just been at a church service that went on a little too long.,Rotten
One guesses the talent that signed up for this negligible movie did so out of good will for Wain and Marino. Or maybe they all did it ... as a goof.,Rotten
"The Ten is, while not ""bad,"" nor ""unfunny,"" surely not as good as it had ought to be.",Fresh
"Three of the comic segments in The Ten are sort of funny. Three others are just so-so. And the remaining four are just dumb, painfully unfunny and/or downright crude.",Rotten
"Some bits... are shockingly funny. Others, like the surgeon who causes a woman's death ""as a goof,"" are just shocking without the funny.",Rotten
Most of the segments are as clueless about their designated commandment as they are about what's supposed to be funny.,Rotten
A blasphemous parody so painful to sit through it seems designed by the Almighty as punishment for heathens and sinners.,Rotten

"Rudd, whose wry deadpan proved indispensable in Judd Apatow comedies like 'The 40 Year-Old Virgin' and 'Knocked Up,' is used here mostly as a straight man, the host in charge of introducing stories that drift along without any real destination.",Rotten
"The beyond-goofy collection of Commandment-inspired vignettes has funny moments, but it's a wildly uneven anthology, with three or four clunkers for every genuine chuckle.",Rotten
"More than simply unentertaining, The Ten comes from an America of silly, laddish self-regard and hollow protest.",Rotten
"Sadly for Mr. Shyamalan, the ideas that have been coming to him since his brilliant first hit The Sixth Sense are progressively worthy of less merit and more deserving of ridicule.",Rotten
"The movie demonstrates a smart movie geek's obsession with the rhythms and gory details of horror storytelling, undermined by a pompous insistence on spiritual lessons of the tritest kind.",Rotten
"One-hit-wonder M. Night Shyamalan further galvanizes the nickname given him by his detractors (""Shyamalama-ding-dong"") with yet another pretentious movie.",Rotten
"The movie seems more like a '50s science fiction film of extreme paranoia or an episode of ""The Twilight Zone"" that even at a swiftly paced 90 minutes feels padded.",Rotten
"Effective nonsense, chilling nonsense, occasionally wrenching nonsense.",Fresh
"Shhht. Don't say it out loud, but we actually kinda liked M. Night Shyamalan's latest movie . . .",Fresh
Nothing happens. Shyamalan has finally taken an ax to his Golden Goose.,Rotten
"Minor Shyamalan, but still well worth seeing.",Fresh
Suicide bland.,Rotten
The Happening quickly deteriorates into the worst movie of M. Night Shyamalan's career... and that's saying something.,Rotten
"The actors try and fail to look terrified at things that simply aren't that terrifying to look at, unless you are one of those people who considers ""Days of Heaven"" to be a relentless excursion in gut-wrenching horror.",Rotten
"But here's the real shocker, the statement that will blow all of your minds... this is one movie that you will be hoping for a twist ending!",Rotten
"In many ways, this ecological horror epic is one of the single nastiest and downright terrifying pieces of popular entertainment I've seen in ages.",Fresh
M. Night Shyamalan is one of the most talented film-makers working today. But he seems to be running out of ideas.,Fresh
one of the worst attempts at end-of-the-world ominousness since the Robot Holocaust battled the Ninja Apocalypse,Rotten

"The Happening is a divertingly goofy thriller with an animistic bent, moments of shivery and twitchy suspense and a solid lead performance from Mark Wahlberg.",Fresh
"The movie is so inept in terms of coherent, cohesive storytelling and in some other filmmaking aspects that it deserves to be laughed off the screen.",Rotten
Basically a junior version of sci-fi disaster films ranging from The War of the Worlds (1953) to last year's The Mist,Rotten
"The suicides are mostly very originally staged and creepy as hell...Mark Wahlberg is OK, but a scene where he 'forgives' his wife's indiscretion is just plain weird, as is Zooey Deschanel throughout.",Fresh
"Shyamalan is far better at setup than payoff, and the Sixth Sense director's latest once and for all cements that reputation.",Rotten
"a cold pastiche, neither bloody enough to attract the crowd that hankers for that sort of thing, nor smart enough to attract the crowd that hankers for that",Rotten
"Happening promises a change of pace, but the magic only lasts for a few moments, then it's all open acre isolation, media blackouts, and mysterious threats with extended, mouth-agape pauses.",Rotten
"There are scattered moments of craft throughout, but the gulf between his lofty aspirations and feeble accomplishments has seldom been wider or more chuckle-inducing.",Rotten
"Shyamalan's still trying to take the story seriously-this is, horror of horrors, a message film-but his atypically unmeasured direction is all shock and no awe.",Rotten
"Were the first 45 minutes of The Happening not as rattlingly effective as they are, one could chalk the film up as mediocre. There is such untapped potential, though, that the dishonest places Shyamalan chooses to take his audience are maddening.",Rotten
"You know those meringue cookies that look so tempting on bakery shelves, the ones that evaporate moments after you pop them in your mouth and leave only the vaguest, unmemorable taste behind? That's The Happening.",Rotten
The Happening stutter-steps its way in this direction and that to a disappointing ending.,Rotten
"Portraying moments of drama and danger with a Hitchcockian lack of ceremony, Shyamalan's mundane depictions of tragedy create a quiet but weighty resonance.",Fresh
"For all his complaints recently about being misunderstood, it seems it's Shyamalan who simply doesn't get us.",Rotten
"This would all seem like a deliberate, self-parodying joke if it weren't coming from a filmmaker with no sense of humor whatsoever.",Rotten
"As for The Happening, his throwback horror flick that plays like The Birds meets The Blob, it's beyond good and evil. It's dumbfounding.",Rotten
"There seem to be a lot of people gunning for Philadelphia's own M. Night Shyamalan, and The Happening will give them more ammo.",Rotten
The Happening wants to scare us without providing a cause -- a trick only Hitchcock has managed.,Rotten
"Instead of shocks, we get moments of tension, suspense and violence between stretches of running scared. Nothing wrong with that, except that the stretches are awfully long in places. And in the end, it all comes to not much.",Rotten
"Excluding moments of chilling effectiveness, this could fairly be called his worst film. Even his saving grace of keen directorial acumen visibly loses cohesion on screen.",Rotten
"Writer-director M. Night Shyamalan's eco-thriller starts with a clever premise and degenerates into spooky atmospherics, portentous pacing and stiff dialogue.",Rotten
Somewhere in The Happening there's a great movie struggling to break free. The concept is fantastic... but poor dialogue combined with even worse performances make for a disappointing and frustrating 90 minutes of film.,Rotten
"mia ap' tis pio akompses, proheires kai hontrokommenes doyleies poy mporeis na petyheis se aithoysa",Rotten
"It's a shame that the movie is such a tonal failure, because it does many other things right.",Rotten
"I'm always amused by the sort of backlashes that Shyamalan is in right now. Well, M. Night Shyamalan makes vague, subtle fantasy thrillers. If you've outgrown it, don't blame him.",Fresh
"If you're in the mood for an absurd film that alternates between boring and comedy, this is the movie for you.",Rotten
M. Night Shyamalan's worst film.,Rotten
"It's an interesting premise for a doomsday thriller, but Shyamalan botches it from the get-go.",Rotten
Trying to understand the thought process of writer and director M. Night Shyamalan is akin to analyzing Jell-O. What keeps it wiggling and what binds it together? This particular circumstance also had an Alfred Hitchcock vibe.,Fresh
just damned creepy,Fresh
Feeble gust of an environmental horror story.,Rotten
Woeful clunker of a paranoid thriller.,Rotten
"A patchy, uninspired eco-thriller whose R rating (a first for Shyamalan) looks more like a B.O. hindrance than an artistic boon.",Rotten
"Shyamalan tries to give the events a scientific underpinning. But his logic is spotty, so what are meant to be eerie moments are not convincing.",Rotten
Both silly and preachy.,Rotten
Shyamalan seems to have lost his sense of the fine line between the disturbingly grotesque and the outright ridiculous. The film even seems to be a parody of the scientific method.,Rotten
"Shyamalan movies demand that you surrender to his way of telling stories. If you're up for that, you should go.",Fresh
"The whole solemn concoction is preposterous and not always in a fun way -- even at 99 minutes' running time, the movie provides plenty of opportunities for watch-consultation in the dark.",Rotten
"The screenplay is a mess, filled with unfunny moments of intended humor and funny moments of unintended humor.",Rotten
"In a Hollywood summer otherwise dominated by comic-book superheroes, blazing action spectacles, snickering teen sex comedies and computer-generated fantasy, M. Night Shyamalan's The Happening is something different -- and a pleasant surprise.",Fresh
"It's an entertaining movie, which is half the game, but it's not scary, which it should be. Neither is it something to be taken seriously, though it's intended to be.",Rotten
"Shyamalan's such an eager recycler, grinding out the same ideas and images again and again. The man who showed such promise less than a decade ago has been leaving a diminishing creative footprint ever since.",Rotten
"The story essentially stops moving midway through. All that's going to occur, in terms of building any true dramatic tension, already has happened by this point.",Rotten
"We don't care. It doesn't matter if they live or die, if there's a happy ending, or some kind of twist. The Happening is a movie to walk out of, sleep through, or -- best of all -- not to bother with.",Rotten
"The plot is absurdly preachy and illogical, and the dialogue uneven, with stinging lines followed by stinkers.",Rotten
"Executed in bland and remote fashion, with little in the way of compelling suspense, mystery or directorial craft. Think of the worst Spielberg thriller or one of Hitchcock's dull late career works.",Rotten
"If Shyamalan's ever going to do something different then he should have made something manic, dark and twisted. But that's not Happening.",Rotten
"There's a long tradition of receiving messages from burning bushes, but jiggling bushes are not to be trusted, and neither are filmmakers who ask us to shiver in their leafy midst.",Rotten
"Not a complete return to form (by far), but also not a failure. Let's be fair--this is the best film Shyamalan has put out in years.",Fresh
No one will watch any of Shyamalan's recent films twice. A movie that features Wahlberg suggesting everyone try to outrun the wind can barely be watched once.,Rotten
"The final explanation, which comes as no surprise, is more preposterous than profound. If you want to see a scary movie about humans wreaking havoc on their planet, watch An Inconvenient Truth instead.",Rotten
"Wahlberg turns in one of his worst performances ever, but then he's saddled with preposterous scenes (like one where he tries to placate a ficus) and such lame lines as ""Could this really be happening?"" Funny, I was wondering the same thing myself.",Rotten
"A subtle, measured work, which means there will be many who find it dull and pointless.",Fresh
"It's creepy, silly fun. And if it came from anyone else, it would be recognized as such. One thing is certain: The man hasn't lost his ability to entertain.",Fresh
Basically it's a half-hour Twilight Zone episode blown up to feature length.,Rotten
"Nobody gets the time or the treatment to become a character you'd actually care about, which makes the general planet-in-peril theme of the movie kind of moot.",Rotten
No mere actor could possibly escape the toxic dialogue oozing from M. Night's pen -- that's merciless.,Rotten
It's downright stupid.,Rotten
The shock value wears off quickly and writer-director Shyamalan strands us in a boring cautionary tale with an infantile eco-message about humanity needing to live in harmony with nature -- or else.,Rotten
"Mr. Shyamalan is plagued by a bad case of Robin Williams Syndrome, characterized by a desire to inspire and change the world through mediocre entertainment √¢"" in this case, accompanied by ample and frequently creative bloodshed.",Rotten
"If this was the movie to rescue the reputation of self-styled genius Shyamalan after the disaster of Lady in the Water, then it's back to the old drawing board.",Rotten
Shyamalan's approach is more effective than smash-and-grab plot-mongering. His use of the landscape is disturbingly effective. The performances by Wahlberg and Deschanel bring a quiet dignity to their characters.,Fresh
"A comeback for the director, but not quite enough of one...an almost equal combination of genuine creepiness and absolute foolishness.",Rotten
"...bad in more than just an everyday, sure-does-suck kind of way.",Rotten
"The film becomes less comprehensible as it goes along, and the audience -- expecting a patented M. Night ending -- is left with no answers, explanation, or narrative closure.",Rotten
It's also a bit sneaky of Shyamalan to set us up for a paranoid 9/11 thriller and then go all Greenpeace on us. He's trying to be socially conscious but he doesn't have the reformist's temperament. He has the temperament of a self-infatuated messiah.,Rotten
You feel like you're not watching the end of the world but the end of a career.,Rotten
Shyamalan wants the rustling of wind through greenery to evoke the same shudders in The Happening that the gathering of birds did in Hitchcock's The Birds,Rotten
The greatest excuse yet to get that anti-M. Night petition started. The last thing we want is a future of Shyamalan films with the knowledge that we all could have done something sooner.,Rotten
Shyamalan crafts a somewhat chilling cautionary tale; it just might have been more chilling if he had been a little less cautious.,Fresh
"M. Night Shyamalan has morphed from ""the next Spielberg"" to a punching bag for critics and audiences alike. The Happening reminds us why.",Rotten
Shyamalan's latest film is the first in a long time that I can't defend.,Rotten
"If what audiences are looking for is a thrill ride, or even a pervasive eeriness, The Happening's just not happening.",Rotten
The Happening features an effectively stylized physical environment: rarely have clouds drifting overhead and wind blowing through trees and a sunny day been filmed so ominously.,Fresh
"The Happening is a film of such shockingly appalling writing, dreadful acting and ham-fisted, ungainly execution that it plays better as a comedy than the thriller it was meant to be.",Rotten
An impressive thriller which acknowledges the mystery that lies behind the marvels and the terrors of the natural world.,Fresh
Bad and weird.,Rotten
"Another disappointment from M, despite some disturbing violence and chilly moments.",Rotten
"The movie is a bummer, from beginning to end.",Rotten
"A tantalising, sometimes frustrating parable about the menaces that human beings might face from unexpected quarters.",Fresh
"Maybe Shyamalan has been plugged into those other worlds for too long. Judging from what is on offer here, he needs to become more acquainted with the emotional language of this one.",Rotten
"While hardly his worst work, this film is so far off his high water mark that it begs the question of whether M. Night Shyamalan will ever truly return.",Rotten
"If you have seen the trailers online or on T.V., you can just save your money and wait for the rental on this one. All of the best moments are in the promos.",Rotten
Another case of elegant filmmaking kneecapped by a thunderingly stupid concept.,Rotten
Shyamalan's essentially made a sociopathic movie.,Rotten
"'The Happening' may not be M. Night Shyamalan's best movie, but it's his most provocative one.",Fresh
"Lacks scares, wit, humor and acting, and Zooey Deschanel, alas, has lost her cuteness.",Rotten
"It's clear that a once creative director is now running out of fumes, trying extremely hard to find something that hasn't been done before. The result is laughable.",Rotten
Where the hell is Act III?,Rotten
"While there are certainly ideas behind it, the film lacks the bloated self-importance that plagued the director's last two efforts. This time, Shyamalan seems content merely to entertain us, and that's enough.",Fresh
The Happening suggests [Shyamalan's] (con) artist's touch is waning a bit.,Rotten
"On a brighter note, the Wayans brothers have new material to make Scary Movie 5.",Rotten
"A creepy cautionary eco-thriller than neither cautions nor thrills. Instead of being full of dread, it's just dreadful.",Rotten
"Shyamalan's direction always seems so serious that it's easy to imagine he may be screwing up when he draws laughs, but I'd lay down money that many of these were deliberate.",Fresh
If Shyamalan wanted to commit career suicide he couldn't have chosen a more likely vehicle than this laugh inducing 'thriller.',Rotten
"What's more annoying than when a mediocre movie constantly males allusions to much better pictures? I know, it's when you wait an hour and a half for a solution this pathetic.",Rotten
"Ouch. 'Lady in the Water' was a dud. And for its ghastliness, filmmaker M. Night Shyamalan took one to the chin. He got back up again, though, to make 'The Happening.'This one's gonna hurt.",Rotten
Someday someone will stop bankrolling Shyamalan's dumb dreams and keep this kind of tripe from happening.,Rotten
"... M. Night desperately needs to find that special someone whose opinion he'll listen to when they say,'No! BAD writer-producer-director! NOT a good idea!'",Rotten
"The film does manage to build some tension, since the survival of the group remains in question right up to the end.",Fresh
"'The Happening' works in early spurts, but apparently Shyamalan ran out of ideas once he came up with his uniquely insidious killer.",Rotten
Works as an effective and brutally horrifying antithesis to the usual explosive summer fare...,Fresh
"There's never an ounce of suspense, mystery, or surprise.",Rotten
I did find myself caught up in Shyamalan's apocalyptic world for a time -- before some really bad dialogue or acting would shake me out of it.,Fresh
"A monster movie desperately seeking a monster, M. Night Shyamalan's The Happening doesn't make sense, much less The Sixth Sense.",Rotten
"It's engrossing one minute and stupefying the next, off and on, off and on, for ninety minutes.",Rotten
"For Night, The Happening is a little blip on his career flatline. The guy just may pull through.",Fresh
The true disaster on display in The Happening is Shyamalan's career hitting rock bottom.,Rotten
"It almost dares you to roll your eyes or laugh at certain scenes that are supposed to be deadly serious. But, you know what, I appreciated this creatively offbeat, daring sci-fi mind-trip.",Fresh
ÔªøAll that's missing is the head alien of Plan 9 From Outer Space dropping by to lecture the populace for disrespecting nature: 'Your stupid minds! Stupid! Stupid!',Rotten
"'There are forces at work beyond our understanding,' says Wahlberg. 'Especially beyond my understanding, if you include virtually every force at work.'",Rotten
Maybe Shyamalan didn't mean for The Happening to be exciting and dramatic: perhaps the writer-director intended the film to be an exercise in sucking all the life and emotion out of fictional characters.,Rotten
"A numbing polemical morality tale in dreary doomsday thriller clothing, this dull downer for all its mass panic attack high alert mode, may be more effective in unintentionally boring people to death.",Rotten
"...a minor, not quite successful film, but for M. Night Shyamalan - whose career has been circling the drain for some time now - it's a step back from the abyss.",Rotten
S√≥ podemos deduzir que o pr√≥ximo projeto de Shyamalan ser√° melhor do que este Fim dos Tempos porque sabemos que ele (ou qualquer outro cineasta) dificilmente seria capaz de fazer algo pior.,Rotten
"Rather than [the R-rating]being an opportunity-opening device for writer/director Shyamalan to pull out of his toolbox, the graphic violence that got him that rating is more like a monkey wrench.",Rotten
Nothing 'happening' here,Rotten
"Other than its ripe possibility for mockery, I cannot think of anything that makes the film really worthwhile.",Rotten
"When a movie's best bit arrives during the closing credits, we're all in trouble.",Rotten
"Only half good cinema, seemingly the result of its maker's stunted belief/determination in both himself and his audience.",Rotten
A better title for M. Night Shyamalan's The Happening would be Nonsense. It's like an amusement park ride that has no reason for being -- and no meaning -- besides visceral excitation. Only difference is that The Happening isn't fun.,Rotten
"The slight premise, coupled with some very bad performances by the cast as well as a screenplay filled with ham-fisted dialogue makes for a film that's not scary and borders on being ridiculous at times.",Rotten
"For a movie with the potential for so much global-warming electricity, it's disappointingly low on voltage.",Rotten
What you end up with is a cross between Roland Emmerich's The Day After Tomorrow and Shyamalan's Signs.,Rotten
Might be perceived by some as all peaches and cream for entertainment value even if everything else about it is not happening.,Rotten
"...some nice creepy moments -- but other moments, and more, of (presumably) unintended humor.",Rotten
"[N]owhere near the level of The Sixth Sense, and not quite as good as the subsequent Unbreakable, Signs, and The Village, but at least it suggests that the awfulness of Lady in the Water may have been an aberration.",Rotten
"Shyamalan's ideas might have more impact in a half-hour 'Twilight Zone' episode, where they would be shorn of some of the pretensions that seem to be mandatory in the feature-length work of a one-time Best Director Oscar nominee.",Rotten
"It's hard to believe that at one time Shyamalan was being touted as the next Steven Spielberg by Newsweek magazine, but if things keep going the way they are now, Uwe Boll might end up being a better comparison. And boy is that depressing.",Rotten
Mark Wahlberg's sturdy performance saves The Happening from becoming a protracted Saturday Night Live spoof of M. Night Shyamalan movies.,Fresh
I'm shaking my head now like a caring teacher grading a poor assignment written by a bright student.,Rotten
There are some creepy moments but overall The Happening is a bit of a non-event.,Rotten
"Whether or not you'll like The Happening might very well depend on how much you like apocalyptic scenarios in your movies. I love 'em, myself. Show me an ad for a lurid doomsday flick and I want to be there opening day, right down front.",Fresh
"This major studio release asks the question, how long can you survive on past glories? Shame on Shyamalan.",Rotten
Holy Mother of God...this is awful.,Rotten
"The Happening is an awful letdown, yet it leaves you with something new, as a gently waving tree -- that classical image of pastoral tranquillity -- mutates into a harbinger of doom.",Rotten
"Un nuevo fiasco de M. Night Shyamalan, que sigue siendo un director con ideas interesantes (tanto argumentales como visuales) pero que necesita urgentemente la ayuda de un buen guionista.",Rotten
"Usually Shyamalan can hide his limitations as a screenwriter behind his skill as a director. Here, that skill fails him as well, and the whole movie falls apart.",Rotten
"Shyamalan creates another urban myth with this slow burning thriller. But it never quite comes to life, due to stiff directing and acting",Rotten
It is the first film of his career that feels incompetent and utterly gratuitous at times.,Rotten
"M. Night Shyamalan offers up low-intensity thrills that fail to match the shivery shudders of his best work (THE SIXTH SENSE, SIGNS). His patented approach - mixing domestic drama with horror - plays out on a much larger canvas.",Rotten
Shyamalan's religious ideas are a lot like Bush's: Nearly theology free.,Rotten
"The M. Knight brilliance is there in quick jolts of suspense and terror, but those moments are the exception in this otherwise flat little thriller.",Rotten
"Shyamalan is a master at a visual iconic moment - but the ""filler"" (you might have learned about it in English class by this name: ""story"") gets weaker and weaker every film.",Rotten
"Shyamalan's latest is an improvement, but a full-fledged comeback ain't happening.",Rotten
"It's a great idea. A silent, unknown killing machine knocking people off while a science teacher tries to figure out why. But it just didn't work.",Rotten
"[A]n astonishment, so idiotic in conception and inept in execution that, after seeing it, one almost wonders whether it was real or imagined.",Rotten
"While not as laughable as the narcissistic Lady in the Water ,it fails just as miserably as narrative and even more miserably with its flat characters and tone deaf dialogue.",Rotten
Undoubtedly M. Night Shyamalan's weakest thriller to date...,Fresh
"More than anything, what bothers me about it is a sense of cheapness that ... centrally comes from a concept mainly built for shock value.",Rotten
"Seeing The Happening is like going on an outing with an earnest person, who happens to be a drunk. Every time it starts to make sense, it slurs its speech and starts dropping things -- such as coherence and credibility.",Rotten
Shyamalan sve lo%u0161ije reagira na gubitak statusa holivudskog bo%u017Eanstva,Rotten
Shot in the inimitable Shyamalan lugubriousness,Rotten
"Horror film is long on peril, but thin on plot.",Rotten
"At first, a great deal happens, then nothing much happens for quite some time, then something so underwhelming happens that one is left wondering, 'Did that really just happen?'",Rotten
"Wahlberg is atrocious, as wooden as the trees terrorising him.",Rotten
The Happening is his first hilariously awful film.,Rotten
"For reasons still unknown, Shyamalan wrote the dialogue this stiffly, and instructed his performers to act like they'd never said words or interacted with each other before.",Rotten
"You just feel you've been conned by a cheap trick, and an old one at that.",Rotten
"One of the most interesting movies of the year, despite being one of the worst. It offers a study in what happens to the mind of a talented moviemaker when he is caught between commercial hysteria and his own engulfing ego.",Rotten
Ultimately it doesn't work -- scenes intended to be played straight become unintentionally funny due to Wahlberg's star turn being so gormless.,Rotten
"You know pretty early on what's likely causing ""the happening,"" and yes, there's a message here.",Rotten
"It's distant, aloof and painfully self-aggrandizing, clearly overconfident in its ability to scare the audience.",Rotten
Shyamalan had no idea how to stitch the frayed fabric of a story that escapes from him from the very first minute. [Full Review in Spanish],Rotten
Even the most fervent M. Night fan will be forced to consider the film one of his weakest efforts.,Rotten
"Speculative pic on how Gaul's answer to Shakespeare found inspiration in an involuntary gig giving a nobleman acting lessons is sumptuous, touching and often laugh-out-loud funny.",Fresh
"Tirard's risk-free approach of of the life of French comedy's reformer, is as light-hearted and cooky, as Lassel Hallstrom's Casanova, just starring Moliere instead of the infamous womanizer, albeit with a much more European cast.",Fresh
Two scripters let their imaginations soar to show us how Moliere would act if he became a character of one of his plays and met people from his other productions--and it works!,Fresh
"The film begins on a serious note, requiring an adjustment on the part of the audience toward its more prevalent comic tone. Once that transition is made, the experience of Moliere is an enjoyable one.",Fresh
Tirard adds just a touch of tragedy for the humor to fully resonate and summons the spirit of his inspiration perhaps more effectively than director John Madden rendered the Bard in heat.,Fresh
A very silly film.,Fresh
"All in all, it's a breezy, jestful and enjoyable divertissement, in which Duris is given free rein to showcase his considerable versatility.",Fresh
"Enjoyable, frequently amusing and surprisingly romantic French romp with a witty script, superb performances and a subtle message about the value of comedy.",Fresh
"It is all jolly, harmless and amusing - at least until we get back to the ""real"" France and the ornate wallpaper starts shimmering again.",Fresh
"While this film is rather talky and a long, it's also a wonderfully complex blend of wit and cheekiness, underscored by a surprisingly serious romance and a steely view of the battle of the sexes.",Fresh
"A bit curate's eggy, sometimes funny and always goodlooking, but neither a particularly good tribute to a great playwright nor a comedy with much weight behind it.",Fresh
"It's impossible to avoid comparison with Shakespeare in Love, which similarly made out that many of the great man's plays were really disguised autobiography; but the earlier film had a lightness of touch and variety of tone missing from this one.",Rotten
"Moliere is an exceptionally likeable period comedy, powered by impeccable performances from Luchini and the wonderful Laura Morante.",Fresh
"Just as you should never judge a book by its cover, never judge a film by its press release. Moliere was the most touching, funny film on show this week.",Fresh
"It's a wonderfully witty film - tr√®s bien, in fact.",Fresh
"Both a glittering showcase for a literary giant's comic genius and a first-class farce in its own right. By turns funny, mysterious, suffering and sexy, Romain Duris again proves he's the most charismatic French actor working today.",Fresh
"When the French do period drama well, they tend to do it very, very well.",Fresh
"This is no biopic, but pure fantasy, a sort of ""Moli√®re in Love"" infused with the bittersweet romantic spirit of the playwright's work.",Fresh
"Using a gap in the French playright's bio as a starting point, Tirad's film is a mediocre stab at a Shakespeare in Love-style serio comedy that concocts an imaginary scenario about the ambitious-but-starving young artist--Tim Grierson",Fresh
"Romain Duris may be a superb actor, but a light comedian he ain't. You need a very sweet tooth for this kind of thing.",Rotten
"The film feels distinctly skinny, as if half the cast haven't arrived. The symmetry of the story is almost too perfect. Several leaps of faith are wildly silly.",Fresh
"A witty, lively period drama that expertly blends comedy and tragedy to create a worthy French counterpart to Shakespeare In Love.",Fresh
"Light of touch but overlong, this is saved by a sparkling performance from Romain Duris.",Fresh
"Filmgoers, especially those familiar with Moli√®re's work, will have a great time.",Fresh
"The Shakespeare in Love song remains the same, only the lyrics have changed.",Rotten
A very satisfying film.,Fresh
"This is the sort of period movie -- that would leave a modern audience with faces of stone. Yet the film, directed by Laurent Tirard, has something. To be exact, it has Fabrice Luchini and Laura Morante...",Fresh
An especially endearing attempt at the budding subgenre.,Fresh
"A funny, witty, bright, and well-acted costume drama about a fictional turning point in the life of the famous French playwright Moliere.",Fresh
"Duris, so good in The Beat that My Heart Skipped, is simply marvelous here. His Moli√®re is a complex creature of intelligence, insecurity, sincerity, obstinacy and burgeoning brilliance.",Fresh
Laura Morante proves once again that she is one of the most intelligent and attractive actresses in the world.,Fresh
"Festooned with oodles of museum-worthy 17th century sets and costumes, Moliere is the sort of slightly naughty but literate frolic that congratulates the audience for its good taste; in other words, it's a bit of a snooze.",Rotten
"Moli√®re is as much about the making of a patroness as it is about the gestation of artistic form, for it's she who eggs on the callow playwright to reinvent comedy as serious business with a powerful moral core.",Fresh
"What's missing, alas, is a greater sense of surprise that might keep the film from feeling somewhat rote.",Rotten
"A well-played but ultimately superfluous assortment of your favorite Moliere scenes strung together by a thread-thin plot that emulates, but in no way replaces, the still-sparkling originals.",Rotten
One of the year's best films to date.,Fresh
A period piece enlivened with slapstick and mischievous wit.,Fresh
This movie about the crucible of imagination has none of its own.,Rotten
"Jean-Baptiste Poquelin, better known as Moli√®re, wrote more than 30 plays, every one of them a hundred times more witty and insightful than the movie Moli√®re.",Rotten
"The actors elevate what might have been fluff into a genuinely moving tale, and the action is so much fun that it doesn't even matter if you've seen Moli√®re's plays before.",Fresh
"It may not be a brilliant act of speculative history, but it's a clever and respectable one.",Fresh
"A sweet and silly comedy reminiscent of Shakespeare in Love, it's lushly filmed and gorgeously set and costumed.",Fresh
"A conventional biopic would probably elide most of this period, which was before the pioneering satirist scandalized the establishment with plays like Tartuffe, but the disarming farce Molire, to its great credit, isn't really a biopic.",Fresh
"Moli√®re is a restful diversion, perhaps too restful, but still acceptable. And the actors go a long way toward bringing it off.",Fresh
A delightful romp with an intriguing story that could have been cut by 30 minutes and not missed a beat.,Fresh
Laurent Tirard gives us a delightful and witty costume piece about what might have happened in those never-accounted-for months.,Fresh
Tirard presents Moli√®re like a 17th century Woody Allen - a playwright who yearns to write drama when his forte is farce.,Fresh
A blithe but satisfying French confection.,Fresh
"The two lead actors are a sight to behold: Romain Duris (Moliere), with his long chin, crooked mouth, asymmetrical moustache, and bewildered eyes, plays off the thin lips and boneless cheeks of Fabrice Luchini's Jourdain.",Fresh
Director and co-writer Laurent Tirard's pleasant but tame approach to his birth-of-a-major-world-dramatist portrait has its virtues.,Fresh
"Underplays its biggest opportunities for laughs, like the film is standing at the plate but unwilling to swing the bat.",Rotten
"Woefully miscast as the seminal 17th-century French farceur Moli√®re, the intense, black-maned young French movie star Romain Duris never seems more comfortable than the brief moments when he's rotting in a dank jail.",Rotten
Moliere is an amusing mix of fact and fiction about the life of the brilliant 17th-century French playwright.,Fresh
"In making a comedy about a writer famed for his perfectly tuned wit, the filmmakers have inspired other expectations. The result is as off-putting as biting into a confection in which the sugar has been replaced by salt.",Rotten
Moliere hardly matches the clever mockery of its 17th century inspiration.,Rotten
"Through homage to Moliere's works and by the film's own example, [director] Tirard reminds us that comedy can provoke both laughter and thought.",Fresh
"As a piece of speculative biography, the movie is unpersuasive.",Rotten
"It nevertheless contains enough wit and charm to keep things humming along even when the plot threatens to bog down into a Gallic version of a typical episode of ""Love American Style.""",Fresh
"If you've enjoyed Moliere's work, you'll enjoy the film.",Fresh
"Like the playwright's comedies, at its best Moliere shows the depths beneath the archetypes.",Fresh
"The movie leaves initially cynical Moli√®re believing in true love after all, the rock star undone by Hallmark.",Rotten
"Lost in the exercise is any insight into Moli√®re's writing or any relevance to today, making his achievements seem more frivolous -- and considerably less amusing -- than they actually were.",Rotten
"An extravagant and thoroughly irresistible story of intrigue, romance, comedy and artistic inspiration.",Fresh
"Director and cowriter Laurent Tirard are clearly under the sway of Shakespeare in Love, but the talented Duris is miscast as the wily Moliere, and Moliere has none of Shakespeare's giddy charm.",Rotten
"I can only wonder what theatre gods Moli√®re angered during his lifetime to deserve such ragtag biographical treatment, but let's hope Moli√®re settles the debt.",Rotten
It turns out that a deep appreciation of the human condition can be accomplished through comedy as much as through drama. At least that's what Moliere learns,Fresh
"The unraveling of this same world, 100 years later, was portrayed in Sofia Coppola's Marie Antoinette, next to whose gilded atmosphere the merely glossy Moli√®re looks like a work of naturalism.",Rotten
"Certainly attractive to look at, but what goes on in front of the manicured lawns and sumptuous seventeenth-century interiors is considerably less amusing than it might be.",Rotten
"The cast is very good. The chemistry between Duris and Morante smolders, while Luchini makes a convincing, bungling aristocrat.",Fresh
It's like a breeze so slight it doesn't leave a tickle.,Rotten
Connoisseurs of Sun King-era costumes and decor are the most likely fans of this impeccably produced but unimaginative pseudo-biopic...,Rotten
"There's not a single moment that you haven't already seen in a different, better period film.",Rotten
"The film illuminates little about Moli√®re himself, but what do you expect from a movie that has the depth of a kiddie pool?",Rotten
"""Moliere"" actually tells a funny, involving story that really does seem inspired by its subject, rather than just lazily cribbing from his work.",Fresh
"An amusing and clever film, often laugh-out-loud funny and filled with sparkling characters.",Fresh
"As the film picks up momentum, however, it becomes the story of an aimless young man who discovers his own brilliant wit and learns how to use it. As he gets closer to the scathing, fearless Moliere we know and love, so does the movie.",Rotten
For theater people and French literature buffs...a delightful game of spot-the-reference...,Fresh
"Un cuadro social de √©poca vivaz y divertido, con estupendo elenco y una cuota de romance y emotividad.",Fresh
"A sumptuous pleasure to behold, with its elegantly designed motifs, infectious energy conveying the emotional sensibility of the time, and splendid comic mischief satirizing the hypocrisy of both the bourgeoisie and aristocracy.",Fresh
A breezy historical romance with a strong knack for comedy.,Fresh
"Deluxe tribute to the playwright gets by, surprisingly, as much by romantic poignancy as farce...it's hard to dislike a picture so in Love with its subject.",Fresh
A sophisticated and literate biographical speculation is the basis of this witty and entertaining portrait of the titular artist.,Fresh
"Witty lines, sumptuous settings, manicured lawns and horses with carriages provide the setting for this frivolous romp that caresses history as it plays with the misadventures of French playwright Moli√®re %u2026 With just the right balance of playfulness",Fresh
Moli√®re has no redeeming qualities.,Rotten
"Moli√®re is as insubstantial as dandelion fluff, and just as apt to blow away in a strong wind.",Rotten
"The film is a shallow study of the ~intoxicating allure of violence', with a few gratuitous tit shots thrown in for good measure.",Rotten
Exploitative and depressing.,Rotten
The violence may be too strong for some but this is worth seeing for a terrific performance by Gillian Anderson.,Fresh
"Masculinity in Crisis, part 364.",Rotten
"Payback involving a shotgun, a kitchen table and a heap of pain.",Fresh
"Even if Straightheads looks as if it was made for about 4, it(TM)s been a long time since someone was brave enough to make a such a movie.",Fresh
Make no mistake: this lo-fi rape-revenge Brit flick wants to shock you.,Rotten
Country rapists have their way with Gillian Anderson and poke Danny Dyer's eye out. The duo want payback.,Rotten
This nasty and nonsensical rape-revenge thriller is a feature-length exercise in wrongness.,Rotten
Straightheads has the pornographic ingredients of a first-rate cult thriller.,Fresh
Where's Mulder when you need him.,Rotten
"Anderson bares (almost) all in this flawed but fitfully fascinating thriller with a comical, if less compelling, turn from Danny Dyer.",Rotten
It's clear from the start this isn't a revenge drama that's going to wimp out at the end.,Fresh
"A repellent, ill-thought-through feature.",Rotten
Feels like an experiment in suspense and violence that doesn't actually tell us anything,Rotten
"The film looks professional and has a relatively big-name star in Gillian Anderson, but the screenplay - written by director Dan Reed - doesn't make a single bit of sense.",Rotten
About how some of us would be willing to sell our souls to protect our loved ones if we had to...,Fresh
...a low-key drama disguised as a revenge thriller...,Fresh
Straightheads is as shallow as a puddle and forgoes anything approaching realism in favour of OTT violence and needless gore.,Rotten
"Berman balances the weight of the actual events with the desire to mount a simply effective horror story, and I think he pulls it off quite well.",Fresh
"Every once in awhile, a film can defy expectations, and Lionsgate's Borderland is one such case.",Fresh
"An unnerving, ruthless, borderline-mesmerizing thriller.",Fresh
"...ultimately descends into a brutal orgy of torture and mutilation that's harrowing to watch, because it's played completely real.",Fresh
"Borderland takes this libertarian view of paradise (no law, no government, just rich people doing what they want) and turns it on its head in a particularly brutal and ugly way, without expressing a political point of view in a heavy-handed way.",Fresh
"...one can't help but admire any film that features a villain with a penchant for saying things like ""I'll decorate my bedroom wall with your skin""...",Fresh
"Borderland teeters between a torture film and a spiritual thriller, but it also plays around with both genres in very intriguing ways.",Fresh
Bluesy background music + a rainy Portland setting enhance the gloomy feel of 'Spiral' and help draw us into the world of its disturbed lead character.,Fresh
"""The camera moves are jarring at times and soothing at others ... a skillful, well crafted piece.""",Fresh
"Spiral is an interesting experiment in the evocation of things that do not actually exist, and it succeeds with sizzle.",Fresh
"It's a wit-free homage to Hitchcock and M. Night Shyamalan that, for all its slick presentation, never comes close to hitting the mark of its forebears.",Rotten
Note to the writers: Just because a movie is a mystery doesn't mean everything in it has to be.,Rotten
Spiral is a joy to behold on every level.,Fresh
"Is a much different film than ""Hatchet."" It's focused, it's low key, it's original, and it really takes its plot seriously...",Fresh
"It's an obvious, overlong, determined misfire of a motion picture...ambitious, but it's also fatally flawed.",Rotten
A surprisingly engrossing two-person character study that (gradually) reveals something quite a bit darker beneath the surface.,Fresh
"one long, slow buildup to a surprise ending that conceals two or three twisting secrets while still remaining elusive and open to interpretation.",Rotten
...a misguided and thoroughly pointless piece of work.,Rotten
"Less accessible to general auds than The Sun, pic deserves major accolades from fests as well as discerning arthouses.",Fresh
Stark but moving snapshot of men on the front line of a nation's nightmare.,Fresh
"Though not a top-notch Sokurov, his new film is a conceptually fascinating meditation on war seen from the perspective of an older woman who visits the battle front.",Fresh
The performance of 80-year-old Vishnevskay is priceless.,Fresh
"Disappointingly uncharacteristic of Sokurov, the humanist moments that pass between them lean toward token sentiment, and the moments that pass between Alexandra and the grandson she traveled so far to see feel inconsequential.",Rotten
"Koyrasmenos dimioyrgika kai thematika, o Sokurov prosferei mia faflatadiki dokimi ton orion tis katatonias",Rotten
This is as faultless a film as I've seen in a long time - certainly my best film of 2007.,Fresh
"Sokurov applies a thoughtful, humanist spin to the Chechen war - or any war - in this quiet mediation.",Fresh
"I found it incredibly hard to care about either the grandmother or the young men and, since there is no plot to hold your interest, torpor ensues.",Rotten
hits on something painful and intrinsically human: the feeling of inevitable disillusionment,Fresh
"Spare yet tactile, a mysterious mixture of lightness and gravity.",Fresh
Russian director Alexander Sokurov brings a political edge to the intra-family dynamics with this relatively straightforward tale of a grandmother's trip to an embattled region of Russia for a visit with her grandson.,Fresh
"Alexandra is a much more modest undertaking, but is just as compelling. And Galina Vishnevskaya, an 81-year-old opera singer, is wonderful as Alexandra.",Fresh
"An arty, cerebral film, Alexandra nevertheless speaks to the heart like a symphony.",Fresh
"Alexander Sokurov's Alexandra feels like a communiqu√© from another time, another place, anywhere but here.",Fresh
Aleksandr Sokurov's anti-war drama Alexandra opens with a curious image and spends 90 minutes squeezing it for all it's worth.,Fresh
The mixture of the surreal and concrete feels remarkably accurate: a verit√© depiction of war with a profound ghostly quality.,Fresh
Sokurov's sentimental poetry embroiders a nation's personal connections to the military; he shows the ineffable grace that contemporary American filmmakers are too pent up to grant us -- truths about fealty that our movies neglect.,Fresh
"[Sokurov is one of the] very few filmmakers with the technique, style, and sheer will to create strange, instantly accessible worlds that not only draw the viewer in, but also remain in the mind as places worthy of revisiting.",Fresh
"There's not a shot fired in the film, but it pierces the heart nonetheless.",Fresh
It's a well-acted piece that finds a unique way to discuss the fortunes of soldiers and their families during times of war.,Fresh
"The images are indelible, if somewhat inscrutable (knowing Russian history would probably help, I suppose), but the message behind them rings out like a warning alarm.",Fresh
Sokurov's excellent new Alexandra begins with an almost laughable scenario.,Fresh
"In the hands of visionary filmmaker Alexander Sokurov, this simple material makes for a haunting drama about war, generational relationships and the human condition.",Fresh
"... at times humorous, at times touching, and unfortunately, at times tedious and distancing.",Fresh
"...a film for the thoughtful, discerning filmgoer who is looking for something not made in the Hollywood, USA.",Fresh
"Alexandra is a pleasure to watch, but it's also one of those lovely, unclassifiable movies that flourishes better with repeated or prolonged exposures.",Fresh
"Alexandra washes over you like a gentle slice-of-life movie rather than polemic, with Vishnevskaya demanding your attention every moment she's onscreen.",Fresh
"The sepia tones and the claustrophobic camerawork are instantly recognizable as Sokurov's work, and so is the emphasis on family intimacy.",Fresh
Every woman with a child in the military dreams about the mysterious environs of war into which her child has disappeared. Such a dream is the subject of Alexander Sokurov's astonishing Alexandra.,Fresh
"Clever scenario looks at the balance of power betwween age, sex, and nationality",Fresh
"Interesting look at life in the Russian military, but to what purpose?",Rotten
One of those pure films that's devoid of excess and overstatement...simple but searing.,Fresh
"The film is built on a massive incongruity: Watching this octogenarian drag her little bent-up wheeled luggage cart, amid rolling tanks and military transport trucks, you're looking at two eternal verities%u2014war, and civilians caught up in its wake%u20",Fresh
"Remarkable, how little Sokurov tells us, while telling us so much.",Fresh
Here is what filmmaking looks like at its absolute best: a movie of bold and aggressive originality that expresses itself with the utmost delicacy.,Fresh
"Perhaps Sokurov's film will leave some viewers as weary as its protagonist, but this intimate and evocative journey through war is well worth taking.",Fresh
Sokurov is able to say things about the terrible conflict without obvious polemic but to the maximum possible effect. That's largely why he is one of the most audacious and original directors in the world today.,Fresh
"His sepia images of war's futility are beautiful, and Vishnevskaya's face is a compelling one, but they cannot compensate for the soporific anti-narrative.",Rotten
"The eerie haze of the visuals, the half-babble of music and the toneless, teasing dialogue dance attendance on the strangest ghost of all: Galina Vishnevskaya.",Fresh
"Shot in shades of bleached-out khaki brown and augmented by a heart-rending orchestral score, it's a unique and intensely moving elegy for wasted lives.",Fresh
It's a film of small details rather than big gestures...and all the more powerful for it.,Fresh
"But Aleksandr Sokurov, with the mesmerising and subtly disorientating directorial style that he has mastered, makes it feel emotionally real and imaginatively true. A wonderful film.",Fresh
A bone-weariness pervades every inch of the film; even the light is bleached dry of vitality.,Fresh
"Apart from a thoroughly irritating background track of schmaltzy classical music, this is Sokurov at his shortest and most digestible.",Fresh
"It's also quietly challenging, in its own way, not least in its portrait of old age, its trials, new freedoms and the privilege of changing one's mind before it becomes too late.",Fresh
"This is war as stalemate, with Aleksandr Burov's bleached images creating an alien landscape in which colour is as rare as compassion. Rarely has combat seemed so savage or futile.",Fresh
"At least one critic has called this Sokurov's most political film, but on its deepest level it considers not a particular war but the complex feelings between mothers and the young men they send out into the world to kill or be killed.",Fresh
"Eccentric and tender, it is a picture out for grace rather than polemics, and it finds enough to make one see emotional intimacy anew",Fresh
An unusual masterpiece atmospheric anti-war film that is an example of cinema as pure feeling.,Fresh
"The film had so beautifully evoked this tenor of decamped emotional ties, of a people cared for forever traveling away from home, by conflating the grandmother's searching familial love with the isolated, forlorn faces of the soldiers...",Fresh
"Alexandra is a film made by someone who wants to talk, which is an admirable gesture. It's just not the correct one.",Rotten
"A rich and rewarding film, a deeply humanist work of art that is as tender as it is bracing.",Fresh
"A well-balanced primer on the Arab-Israeli conflict, Blood and Tears takes just over an hour to go from the roots of Zionism to the recent electoral victory of Hamas.",Fresh
"'A small house can accommodate hundreds of friends, but can't accommodate two enemies,' the doctor says ruefully, quoting an Arab proverb. Sadly, Blood and Tears is the proof.",Fresh
"Unless you've thrown up your hands and butted out of all news of the Middle East debacle, nothing in this methodical, unimaginative documentary about the Arab-Israeli conflict will surprise, edify or, God forbid, outrage you.",Rotten
"Nothing more than a collection of sound bytes, most of them biased, many of them inflammatory, by a variety of speakers. It is hard to know what good this does.",Rotten
"As the film progresses, it becomes increasingly bold in taking sides, while all the time pretending to be unbiased.",Rotten
"Though refreshingly reluctant to take sides regarding geography of the matter, the film has a subtle slant toward peace.",Fresh
"...a fun, jazzy look at L.A.'s first real wave of modern artists",Fresh
Morgan Neville's quick-paced documentary The Cool School recounts the rise and fall of Ferus Gallery and the mark it made on American art.,Fresh
A lively film that doesn't linger too long on any one thought or with any one interviewee.,Fresh
"It is a fascinating journey through a piece of art history, the full impact of which may be yet to come.",Fresh
"What The Cool School does so well, through its color accents and black-and-white photography...is impart a sense of discovery.",Fresh
"No one emerges very well defined from this historical shuffle, but those who know the artists' works, or names such as Hopps and Blum, but have never heard them speak, will find The Cool School absorbing and informative.",Fresh
"All told, and well told, this is essential history.",Fresh
"Largely avoids sharply delineated portraits, with its focus on the scene at the expense of individuals, ultimately resulting in a documentary that doesn't rise above the functional.",Rotten
"Though designed more for the devotee of the arts than your average moviegoer, the film is still apt to enthrall even the uninitiated who wouldn't know a Jackson Pollock from a Willem de Kooning.",Fresh
"Documentarian Morgan Neville takes an appropriately lively, left-field approach to The Cool School's eye-opening history of the Beat-era Left Coast art scene -- a lesser-known chapter in the story of American modern art.",Fresh
Surf's up in Southern California as the modern art world invades Nixonville and Reagan City in the 1950s. A fascinating look at the start of something big: modern art in Los Angeles.,Fresh
Thoughtful and thought-provoking.,Fresh
Diverting.,Fresh
"The Cool School, a breezy, lively documentary about a thin slice of the Los Angeles fine art scene in the 1950s, is easy on the eyes, and the ears too.",Fresh
Cool School is a must for anyone interested in 20th century American art.,Fresh
"Definitely proves that, contrary to certain opinions, Los Angeles is not a cultural wasteland where fine art is concerned.",Fresh
Sweeps you off your feet with quick-witted visuals and cleverly used archival footage.,Fresh
Makes the case that there's more than basket weaving and freeway driving going on in the seedbed of originality we know as the Great Basin of L.A.,Fresh
Breezy doc lives up to its title.,Fresh
Veteran documentarist Morgan Neville's illustrated history of the painters and sculptors associated with Venice's Ferus Gallery (1957-1967) is at once lively and analytical.,Fresh
"The Cool School is neither as lively nor as complete as it could be, but as an introduction to modern art, it's a fine freshman course.",Fresh
The Cool School is a history of the LA art scene which will be most interesting for those who are involved in it.,Rotten
"Occasionally too reverent, this remains an effective evocation of a vibrant and interesting art scene, not to mention a touching paean to lost youth.",Fresh
Morgan Neville's 'The Cool School' is a slickly packaged document of the burgeoning modern art scene in LA during the late '50s and early '60s which sadly submerges its fascinating subject matter in technical clutter and contrived set-ups.,Fresh
"Neville's film shows, in effect, how deliberate the founding of an art movement can be. But also how thrilling it is for those at the eye of the storm.",Fresh
"An intense, sexy medical thriller that gives us a glimpse of what CSI would look like if it were a horror.",Fresh
"Medical thriller mixes extreme violence, sex.",Fresh
"If you are a hardcore fan of films like FLATLINERS, I guarantee that you'll dig this flick... PATHOLOGY is really a gem that doesn't deserve to be overlooked.",Fresh
One of the more effective and chilling thrillers released this year.,Fresh
"Not exactly a great movie, but it's sick, slick, and strange enough to warrant a 90-minute look.",Fresh
"When a movie opens with the diner scene from When Harry Met Sally as performed by cadavers, and later proceeds to sex scenes involving scalpels and needles, the actual plot becomes inconsequential.",Fresh
An inordinately sleazy medical thriller operating on the erroneous belief that the combination of hot sex and cold corpses constitutes a real turn-on.,Rotten
"This is the film that should have been called ""Coma""",Rotten
"Slickly made but utterly gratuitous, this wannabe-edgy thriller was an odd choice for Ventimiglia to make during his first Heroes hiatus.",Rotten
It's as if [director] Schoelermann and screenwriters Mark Neveldine and Brian Taylor had more of a concept than a concrete idea.,Rotten
"A particularly nasty slice of medical-themed horror, Marc Scholermann's film is the sort of thriller in which the tenderest scene depicts an autopsy.",Rotten
"Much like Crank, it's the guiltiest of guilty pleasures.",Fresh
"Even squeamish viewers are apt to be captivated by the tight, credible scripting; these 20-somethings talk and behave like today's irony-clad young sophisticates. And whatever your opinion of the subject matter, you can't fault the filmmaking.",Fresh
"Like its characters, the pic is too clever for its own good, allowing the meticulously researched scenario to be undone by implausible behavior and gaping plot holes.",Rotten
As dull as a conversation with a corpse.,Rotten
"Gleefully brimming with body parts and bad behavior, Pathology is a fun piece of flamboyant tastelessness.",Fresh
"Existing somewhere in a world between Flatliners, Saw and Last Tango in Paris, this oversexed, over the top, underwritten medical horror flick won't come anywhere near the success of those films.",Rotten
Comes off as a semi-absurd variant of the horror mystique cheating the potentials of impeccable production values.,Rotten
"To put things into perspective, the campier ""Saw"" films are all better -- and more clever ...",Fresh
...a sporadically compelling yet hopelessly inconsequential piece of work.,Rotten
This new Christmas Carol starring Jim Carrey will scare the bejesus out of small children!,Rotten
"Conceptually brilliant with mind-blowing special effects, but who is the intended audience of this visual extravaganza? Certainly not children: the content is far too dark with haunting imagery that could provoke nightmares for impressionable youngsters",Fresh
"If Disney invested in this because they were hoping for an annual re-release and an easy cash cow every time the season rolls around, I think they'll be disappointed.",Fresh
"A clear step in the right direction for Zemeckis and his pet techno-project, the film nonetheless ultimately sabotages itself by prizing the hectic over the heartfelt.",Rotten
"This Carol has a worse identity crisis than Scrooge. Clinging to the novel, the film tries to break out of its insular theatrics to propel Scrooge and his supernatural helpmates into outer space, as if in takeoff into a different sci-fi comic book movie.",Rotten
The director has brought this Charles Dickens classic to such vivid life that in some ways you feel like you are experiencing it for the first time,Fresh
A Christmas Carol is a whiz-bang 3-D thrill-ride with all the emotional satisfaction squeezed out of it.,Rotten
"Zemeckis' motion-capture animated features continue to be odd presents, offering undeniable technical skill with a host of other obstacles hindering total enjoyment.",Fresh
"There are nightmarish images, ghostly themes and a feeling that it might be a bit much for kids, but it's a touching film with visuals that will blow your mind. It's a trip.",Fresh
"Bob Hoskins looks just right as kind old Mr. Fezziwig, but that may be more of a testament to the actor's physiognomy than to the motion-capture process, which makes most of the film's cast look like they just sauntered out of Madame Tussauds.",Rotten
"A Christmas Carol is, in its essence, a product reel, a showy, exuberant demonstration of the glories of motion capture, computer animation and 3D technology. On that level, it's a wow. On any emotional level, it's as cold as Marley's Ghost.",Rotten
"Shortchanging traditional animation by literalizing it while robbing actors of their full range of facial expressiveness, the performance-capture technique favored by director Robert Zemeckis looks more than ever like the emperor's new clothes.",Rotten
A Christmas Carol is an engaging and relatively dark take on a seasonal classic that finds director Robert Zemeckis refining the performance capture animation technique he used to mixed effect on The Polar Express and Beowulf.,Fresh
"By the time it's over, you'll have to be a real Scrooge yourself to not have at least a little bit of the Christmas spirit instilled into you.",Fresh
"This is a faithful retelling of the story, proving that strong tales such as these are better off without embellishment. The enhancements here come, not to the source material but to the look of the film, which is beautifully rendered in immersive 3D.",Fresh
"A moody picture of extraordinary technical achievement, not a glazed retelling of holiday reform. The distance is unavoidable, but my hope is that audiences take the opportunity to drink in the astonishing craftsmanship of the film.",Fresh
"Disney's A Christmas Carol is a marvelous and touching yuletide toy of a movie, and the miracle is that it goes right back to the gilded Victorian spirit of those black-and-white films of yore.",Fresh
Zemeckis' latest motion-capture CGI project capsizes Dickens' narrative power simply because the faces of the human simulacra are so utterly inexpressive and ugly.,Rotten
"Against the odds, this Disney version, written and directed by Robert Zemeckis, could be the best adaptation to date of the story.",Fresh
Charles Dickens' classic story hasn't been revitalized but it has been faithfully and capably recreated.,Fresh
"Even as [Zemeckis] uses the 3D process to turn A Christmas Carol into a rollercoaster ride through a solidly built fantasy world, he never forgets that at bottom the tale is an awful warning about how egoism and greed can destroy your humanity.",Fresh
"All style and no substance, Disney's A Christmas Carol is a yawn inducing retread of a tired fable.",Rotten
"Utilizing performance-capture technology, it's intricate and ingenious, offering a 3-D fantasy/adventure thrill ride, soaring into the holiday season.",Fresh
"Thankfully, this Christmas Carol is Scrooge-centric...and, thanks to an unusually layered performance by Jim Carrey, that mostly saves the day for this film.",Fresh
Charles Dickens' lifelong wish to have his story retold as a three-dimensional cartoon has finally been realized. At last his soul may be at peace.,Rotten
3-D adaptation of classic holiday tale may scare young kids.,Fresh
If you've ever wanted to see what 3D could actually do for a film if it wasn't just used as a gimmick then check out A Christmas Carol.,Fresh
Parental Content Review,Fresh
"Children not already familiar with the past iterations of A Christmas Carol will be in heaven if they can get past the spookier elements, while the rest of viewers will be happy with, if not quite euphoric for, what Robert Zemeckis has cooked up.",Fresh
"Happily, despite all the ornamentation in this 3-D adaptation, the pic remains mostly faithful to the novel, while only occasionally devolving into spectacle.",Fresh
"Just when you give up on it, usually in the middle of its latest, extraneous, gyroscoping thrill-ride sequence, Zemeckis reminds you that he's capable of true visual dynamism, enhanced but not wholly dictated by the digital landscape he so clearly adores.",Fresh
"Carrey's Scrooge is deliciously pinched and credible. As, indeed, is this film -- that is, when it feels like Dickens and not a theme park ride.",Fresh
Have we learned nothing from The Klumps?,Rotten
"To put it bluntly, if Scroogely, Disney's 3-D animated version of A Christmas Carol is a calamity.",Rotten
"By the time A Christmas Carol finishes piling its many shiny presents with their many bells and whistles under the tree, there's no room left for tears for Tiny Tim. Bah humbug indeed.",Rotten
This motion-capture animated adaptation is a real Christmas cracker.,Fresh
"Zemeckis' movie may lack the emotional impact of the 1951 British version of A Christmas Carol, starring Alastair Sim as a truly transformed and happy Scrooge. Nevertheless, it's a visual treat that respects and artfully enhances its source.",Fresh
"Enough elements of Dickens's story remain for a viewer to be refreshed by Scrooge's change of heart, and to be moved by his rediscovery of the Christmas spirit that climaxes the story.",Fresh
A re-telling should either present a resonant or fresh thematic take. This Christmas Carol seems like a pale ghost of Dickens' magical Christmas classic.,Rotten
"Carrey's performance as the miserly misanthrope is lost amid effects more typically encountered in theme-park and video-game adventures. (P.S.: Is it just me, or does it also peeve you that the Mouse House claims proprietary rights on Dickens' title?)",Rotten
"There's some dazzling stuff here. But you get creepy, dead-eyed and inexpressive performances - even sympathetic characters end up looking like the ventriloquist's doll in that Anthony Hopkins movie.",Rotten
"It's nice of Hollywood to go to all the trouble but, honestly, Dickens doesn't need the help.",Fresh
"Charles Dickens wrote the book 50 years before movies even existed. He wrote for the imagination. And until now, movies haven't been able to measure up.",Fresh
"It's an unengaging, dull adaptation that has nothing really new to say in regards to the already-much-told tale.",Rotten
"Shockingly, the new film turns out to be very good, at times close to brilliant: a darkly detailed marvel of creative visualization that does well by Dickens and right by audiences -- when it's not trying to sell them a theme park ride.",Fresh
"The holiday spirit feels real, but the film does not.",Rotten
Clear evidence of the limitations of the performance-capture method of animation and of the excesses it invites...there's more of artifice than art in it.,Rotten
The utter freedom of camera movement evokes a visceral sense of buoyant jubilation that immediately connects us to the movie's setting.,Fresh
"It's visually stunning and all, but this is one version of A Christmas Carol that the world can probably live without. Humbug!",Rotten
All I want for Christmas is for Robert Zemeckis to stop making mo-cap movies.,Rotten
"If you want realism, use actors. If you want animation, use your imagination. Sadly, imagination is missing from this technically impressive but emotionally inert film.",Rotten
It's eerie rather than wondrous.,Rotten
"It's not that Carrey fails in this serious guise, but, rather, it strips the comic actor of everything that makes him so special.",Rotten
"Too much of the film is geared around 3-D wizardry. Unneeded sequences pop up for purely ""wow"" baiting.",Rotten
A leaden and ugly mess that offers all the emotional and dramatic heft of an exceptionally garish Christmas window display.,Rotten
"Robert Zemeckis finds eye-popping, high-tech new life in Dickens' hoary chestnut.",Fresh
"The best part of this Christmas Carol is the end, when the ugly animation metamorphoses back into the pages of a book.",Rotten
"The story that Dickens wrote in 1838 remains timeless, and if it's supercharged here with Scrooge swooping the London streets as freely as Superman, well, once you let ghosts into a movie, there's room for anything.",Fresh
"By Fezziwig, that story still works and tugs at the heart. It would even if each ghost's visit weren't scored with overly-suitable Christmas carols.",Fresh
"In spite of its holiday trappings, A Christmas Carol is an incredibly bleak look into the deepest and darkest human fears, but it is also a vibrant celebration of our better natures.",Fresh
"In this morality tale, which winds up playing like the advertisement for an amusement park ride, Scrooge is supposed to be afraid of the truth, not the ghosts.",Rotten
A refreshing update of Dickens' timeless tale.,Fresh
"The whole enterprise is just so empty and pointless, a bunch of bland technical wizardry that will be dated in five years.",Rotten
"Writer-director Robert Zemeckis follows Charles Dickens' 1843 novella, A Christmas Carol, so closely that he even makes the same error the author made with the first edition of the book.",Rotten
"You don't need glasses -- 3-D or otherwise -- to see that this holiday release is too diluted for adults, too frightening for children, and too tiresome for just about everybody.",Rotten
"Most of us know the beginning, middle, and uplifting end. However, the hook this time is a trifecta: 3-D, digital imagery, and Jim Carrey. That hook makes this 'Christmas Carol' worth seeing.",Fresh
A garish and tedious animated interpretation of the Charles Dickens classic that has neither heart nor soul.,Rotten
"Boasts dazzling CGI effects and important moral lessons, but it suffers from excessive style over substance while lacking the genuine, unadulturated warmth, emotional resonance and soul of the Dickens classic.",Rotten
Scrooge's ultimate transformation to kindness and charity comes too late and is given little screen time. Carrey never gets a chance to be the funny comedian that has endeared him to his legion of fans.,Rotten
There are already so many great adaptions of the classic Dickens story %u2013 this one adds nothing but CGI and gimmicky 3D effects.,Fresh
Zemeckis seems unable to admit that the motion capture animation he's been using on The Polar Express and Beowulf is an artistic dead end.,Rotten
"exactly what I expected from Zemeckis and company. With the Dickens story as the foundation, it's perfect for the holiday season",Fresh
"Yes, Zemeckis does throw in a few gratuitous moments where things are flying at your face, but he ends up using enough restraint to ensure the 3D doesn't overwhelm your senses or take away from Dickens' stirring story about greed and redemption.",Fresh
The only major change Disney's A Christmas Carol takes with the source material is draining the humanity right out of it.,Rotten
How they made it into this Disney adaptation unprettified is a Christmas miracle in itself.,Fresh
Zemeckis... appears to have given up making fantasies for grownups in favor of making theme-park attractions designed to do nothing more than shut the kiddies up for 90 minutes...,Rotten
In the end you don't have to analyze it... that tear in your eye tells you it's working.,Fresh
"Too bad though, that for all the eye-popping spirits on screen, it lacks a soul.",Rotten
"Although Dickens has been translated time and time again, this animated adventure is no humbug.",Fresh
"Call me a Scrooge, but I'll pass on this synthetic version of that most humanistic of tales.",Rotten

Want the creeps for Christmas? Then check out the latest version of A Christmas Carol.,Rotten
Does this entertainment achieve a timelessness beyond its exquisite source material? Not even. Yet there's pleasure to be had and relief in feeling the filmmakers didn't Scrooge it up either.,Fresh
Disney's excessively hyped A Christmas Carol brings Dickensian details to such sumptuous life that you mostly forgive it for possessing a stop-motion soul.,Fresh
"The movie may be yet another retelling of an iconic story, but visually it is often quite breathtaking.",Fresh
"Zemeckis captures all the story's terror, but its pathos has always been the real challenge, and it mostly eludes him.",Rotten
"You don't identify with Scrooge at any point, nor is blatant fakery scary. Picture The Seventh Seal with sock puppets.",Rotten
A branded piece of shiny seasonal entertainment.,Fresh
"Robert Zemeckis turns the classic Dickens tale into a 3D performance-capture spectacle, abetted by the versatility of Jim Carrey as skinflint Scrooge and his ghostly visitors.",Fresh
Succeeds in delivering a respectful--if not always magical--interpretation of Dickens' famous tale.,Fresh
all science and little sentiment,Fresh
It feels like Zemeckis wanted to make one movie (a socially relevant ghost story) and Disney wanted another (a Polar Express-type movie). It doesn't work.,Rotten
"The good news about A Christmas Carol, then, is that Dickens' story -- the pure power of it, the grace and gentleness, the sensibility and sentiment of it -- cannot be drowned or destroyed no matter how many technicians and dollars are thrown at it.",Rotten
A splendidly mounted and visually imaginative animated 3D version of the classic novel.,Fresh
"For the most part, Zemeckis delivers a faithful interpretation of Dickens' work in this PG-rated holiday tale. What he misses out on capturing is the spirit of Dickens' story.",Rotten
...a remarkable and effective adaptation of Charles Dickens' classic novel that manages to overcome the familiarity of its source material and become something more fulfilling.,Fresh
"this is not the Scrooge McDuck or Mr. Magoo version of the classic Charles Dickens tale, this A Christmas Carol is the dark, challenging and frightening version of the story",Fresh
"Cinematographer Robert Presley and the design team provide many instances of graphical triumph, influenced by silent cinema.",Fresh
"As for this 'performance capture,' rife with characters sporting the annoying wandering eye, it might be time for an intervention, ghostly or not. You're a filmmaker, Mr. Z, not a puppeteer. Enough is enough.",Rotten
This Hollywood adaptation is as glossy as Christmas wrapping paper and just as disposable.,Rotten
"A Christmas Carol should be as cosy and familiar as piping-hot tea and buttered, toasted crumpets, not a brain-battering sensory assault that feels like downing tequila shots on a rollercoaster.",Rotten
"There is a weird lack of passion here, almost condescension, a sense that Scrooge's agonised moral journey into his past is potentially pretty dull, and so Zemeckis is always livening things up by whooshing the old miser excitingly through the night sky.",Rotten
Zemeckis has succeeded is transforming a staid and over-familiar story into a rip-roaring and viscerally powerful special effects chase-movie.,Fresh
The whizzing pyrotechnics aren't quite enough to make this a Christmas classic.,Rotten
"A Christmas Carol is certainly set to win the nation's attention. With all this hype, we'd hoped for something a bit more special.",Fresh
"It is an experience, being stunning to look at -- and you'll only get the full effect from seeing it on the big screen, rather than waiting for the DVD.",Fresh
Zemeckis brightens up the screen with beautiful visual effects but had trouble bringing anything new to this already amazing story that we have heard a million times before.,Fresh
"Charles Dickens's reflective, universal story becomes fodder for a technological thrill ride starring a rough approximation of Jim Carrey.",Rotten
Sometimes the richness of the visual banquet threatens to leave viewers with Christmas afternoon indigestion yet never stops you feeling hungry for more.,Fresh
"In a very real sense, this version of A Christmas Carol is the most faithful to Charles Dickens' original text ever filmed.",Fresh
"A strikingly animated and thoroughly magical 3-D adaptation... that, counter to so many other versions, beautifully captures the darkly intense vibe of Dickens' ghost story.",Fresh
It's a heartwarmer that doesn't have much of a heart itself.,Rotten
"If you want an entertaining period piece, you could do a lot worse than attend Robert Zemeckis' A Christmas Carol.",Fresh
Disney's excessively hyped A Christmas Carol revels so richly in bringing the Dickensian details to sumptuous life that you wind up forgiving it for possessing a stop-motion soul.,Fresh
A near-perfect blend of looks and heart.,Fresh
A technically proficient but disturbing adaptation (that) adopts a surprisingly macabre tone.,Rotten
It's like taking a Christmas wreath and dipping it in wax or laminating a Christmas card in plastic. Zemeckis risks creating another Yule ghoul: the Ghost of Christmas Without Soul.,Rotten
"As the lead character, Carrey's CG-created body is spindly and bent, and he has fun with his vocal performance, turning every word into a strangled hiss.",Fresh
"The use of 3-D leaves the not unpleasant sensation that snow is gently falling throughout the entire cinema. A respectable, high-tech stab at an old favourite but the Alastair Sim version remains the best.",Fresh
"After round two in Jim Carrey vs. Holiday Classics, it's Carrey 2, Classics 0.",Rotten
Full of Christmas cheer this is not.,Rotten
"The story is robust enough to survive the theme-park treatment, and for the most part it's a very good ride, with a welcome note of actual Christmas caroling spirit.",Fresh
"Dickens purists can stay away. Others can feel free to sample the rollicking aerial views of Victorian London, the droll and scary elasticity of Carrey.",Fresh
Scores high on swooping visuals and meticulous draughtsmanship.,Fresh
"There's no warmth from these spooky, human-modelled digitised automatons, who glide about like all-night trance festival-goers the morning after.",Rotten
"Despite the obvious care given the story, at its heart it is a dry lump of coal. This ""Christmas Carol"" is curiously remote and cold.",Rotten
"A Christmas Carol is a worthy stab at mixing old and new, a vintage tale done with some fresh dazzle and a reminder that the movies can still bring the wow.",Fresh
"Leaves a lot to be desired, and it's a virtual grab bag of good ideas mixed with bad.",Rotten
[It's] not something you should say bah humbug to.,Fresh
"At its best, this revamp gets the eerie oppressiveness of London fog and Marley's rattling chains just right -- we all know the moral, but Zemeckis does remind us what a spine-chilling yarn it is.",Fresh
"Unfortunately, as good as the animation is, it never quite manages to bring any of the characters to life and the film fails to connect on an emotional level as a result.",Rotten
"For most of us, all the surprises here are visual, and it's well worth seeing in 3D.",Fresh
"As a movie to get you in the Christmas spirit, A Christmas Carol does its job nicely.",Fresh
A visual extravaganza with dazzling special effects.,Fresh
"Really, who cares? The essence of the story has been lost in the process. Give me The Muppet Christmas Carol any day.",Rotten
"There is an almost constant deadness to the eyes that is deeply distracting, while each person's movements are so ungainly and wild even Gumby would look at them all wandering around and wonder why they look so uncomfortably odd.",Rotten
Animatronic robots would feel more human than this.,Rotten
"Zemeckis tries to juice things up by staging numerous chase scenes up and around London, but do we really need ""A Christmas Carol: The Action Picture""?",Rotten
"Mr. Zemeckis has always been a talented, if less than subtle, director. And his ""Carol"" is never dull. But it also never justifies its own existence.",Rotten
"As a dedicated fan of Charles Dickens' works, I also am a dedicated fan of several versions of his classic ""A Christmas Carol.""",Fresh
"Hold onto your mug of warm apple cider. This newest, action-packed version of A Christmas Carol could get a little bumpy.",Fresh
An exquisitely crafted visual experience.,Fresh
Seeming spawned from some ghoulish dream I felt nothing warm or symbolic of a tradition from this film.,Rotten
"Are the less than perfectly executed bits supposed to set off the truly terrific ones, or are the truly terrific ones supposed to distract the viewing audience from the bits that go clunk in the night?",Rotten
...we never experience that moment when Scrooge's heart melts. He seems already changed the moment Marley leaves him.,Rotten
"Yes %u2014 I am giving A Christmas Carol a high rating. It is technical perfection and brilliantly done. However, it is too much Zemeckis, too much Carrey. Not enough Dickens.",Fresh
"'My next project is to motion capture some hair and comb it over my 3D scalp,' said Zemeckis.",Fresh
Robert Zemeckis seeks to answer the one question still remaining about the Dickens classic: What would the story look like if it were cast with figures from Madame Tussauds?,Rotten
Those who enjoy virtual roller-coaster rides and long falls from high places are encouraged to attend.,Rotten
"The biggest surprise... is that it isn't absolutely dreadful. Perfectly pointless, maybe, but not dreadful.",Rotten
"The 3-D motion-capture version runs through the motions, except for one detail: It's visually beautiful.",Fresh
The real nightmare before Christmas - way too scary for the kiddies and not nearly warm enough for audiences of all ages.,Rotten
"The motion capture animation is top-notch and it's hard not to be impressed with what Robert Zemeckis has wrought, even if there's the occasional sense he's pandering to an audience that can't get through a 90 minute story without a few yuks and a chase.",Fresh
"Leaving aside the technology behind Robert Zemeckis' animated A Christmas Carol, this is the most satisfying version of Charles Dickens' oft-told tale in years.",Fresh
"What's curious about the movie is that you can tart it up all you want, but Dickens' words still resonate, his characters still infuriate, frighten and touch, and there's still satisfaction to be had in his tale.",Fresh
Jamais deixa de impressionar.,Fresh
The greatest tension in this adaptation of A Christmas Carol isn't between Scrooge and those pesky ghosts but within writer-director Robert Zemeckis.,Fresh
"It's a film so determined to make you notice it, that it comes across like an obnoxious child screaming, 'Look at me!'",Rotten
"... the heart of the story is there, and Zemeckis honors and respects it.",Fresh
The 3D isn't enough to justify yet another version of this familiar tale; the film seems more opportunistic than necessary.,Rotten
This film is dark and scary enough that it just might scare some in the audience straight.,Fresh
"It is done with skill and imagination, and overseen by a director, Robert Zemeckis, who knows the value of occasionally quietening things down for a bit of tension or a precisely timed joke.",Fresh
Faithfully rendered and extremely frightening.,Fresh
Watching the humans in this live action/animation combo is like watching 'Zombies On Parade',Rotten
"If you're remaking a classic merely to one-up whoever remade it previously, is it really worth the effort? Fortunately, Jim Carrey decided not to waste a wasted opportunity.",Fresh

...there isn't much to fall in love with in Robert Zemeckis's visually overpowering motion-capture-animation...,Rotten

Robert Zemeckis' infatuation with the motion-capture animation process has officially gone too far...,Rotten
Its' lavish details bridge the gap between the real and the imagined in a way heretofore impossible.. the filmmakers have put most of their magic in the media and not the message.,Fresh
There's a certain irony in having a timeless tale about a man finding his soul being told in the most soulless way possible,Rotten
"What's good is very good and what's bad is sadly bad. I wish I could cut a montage of the sobering and well-thought-out segue from Present to Future, the swooping flights through London and Scrooge's amazing face.",Fresh
The effects work here is far beyond a tech wizard showing off; it's more like watching Zemeckis lose his mind. He seems so obsessed with what he can do with the FX that he doesn't stop to consider whether he should.,Rotten

"Just like a new cover version of a classic song, A Christmas Carol is all crisp technology, same ol' structure, and a lot of spirit as substitute for a lack of soul.",Rotten
"With a price tag of $175 million, Zemeckis might have even been able to pinch some pennies by abandoning the mo-cap and filming A Christmas Carol in live action. Hmm, I sound a little like Scrooge. Bah humbug!",Rotten
"The 1951 Alastair Sim version still ranks as the Number 1 Christmas Carol, but this mo-cap CGI animated version comes in a close second.",Fresh
Creepy animation and a somewhat tired retelling might have you longing for the Muppet adaptation instead. At least the film's 3D-designed visuals are breathtaking.,Rotten
"Zemeckis's retelling of A Christmas Carol is solid, most importantly letting the story itself shine through where it naturally does.",Fresh
Zemeckis and Disney's collaboration brings about a cold and forgettable variation using the advent of animation and technology to destroy the magic...,Rotten
Bah humbug: Zemeckis and Carrey screw with Scrooge.,Rotten
"A supernatural parable of terrifying, chain-rattling spirits and mind-warping time travel, with a theme of social responsibility that extends far beyond seasonal cheer.",Fresh
"What the film suffers from is a want of common comfort, despite its nominally redemptive, happy ending.",Rotten
A remarkable and effective adaptation of Charles Dickens' classic novel that manages to overcome the familiarity of its source material and become something more fulfilling.,Fresh
One cannot help but feel the same effect could have been accomplished by simply making a live action film with state-of-the-art visual effects.,Fresh
"If you are officially done with Halloween, and you're ready to start feeling like Christmas is right around the corner, then this movie is a must.",Fresh
"While for some there is something disconcerting about the lifeless eyes of the otherwise life like characters, it certainly lends itself to large 3D cinemas, with rubber faced characters and grand sweeping movement.",Fresh
"This, I told myself, is going to suck. And in most ways, it does suck as fully as expected. But there are, surprisingly, a few decent points, too.",Rotten
"This computerised version of A Christmas Carol automatically loses something in becoming very homogenised and, dare I say it, Americanised.",Rotten
"A chilly, cold-to-the-touch interpretation.",Rotten
I know it isn't perfect but I really like it.,Fresh
"The elegant simplicity of Dickens' novel is lost somewhere underneath the eye-popping visuals, whittled down to nothing more than a series of pixels and binary code.",Rotten
"In the end, the only emotion generated is anger-that this is how a whole generation of kids will get their first taste of A Christmas Carol.",Rotten
Christmas magic never fails to touch the heart and spirit and neither will A CHRISTMAS CAROL. God Bless Us Everyone.,Fresh

This film will wind up being forgotten. [Full Review in Spanish],Rotten
[An] expertly assembled and engrossing documentary.,Fresh
"Charting the thin line between courage and foolhardiness, it's a poignant portrayal of the excruciating emotional odyssey of all involved.",Fresh
"A sad story, but well told, with respect for its subject and an eye for the Shakespearian tragedy in the tale.",Fresh
"Stories celebrating heroic journeys are commonplace, but this is a sobering, anti-heroic tale of an ordinary man who set out to attempt the extraordinary... and failed through a cruel combination of bad luck and bad judgement.",Fresh
"The pic should suck even landlubbers into a whirlpool of gripping adventure, overblown ambitions and sheer human folly.",Fresh
"Deep Water confirms all the mythical terrors that lurk in our dreams of the sea, and the best person to watch it with would be Melville.",Fresh
"Given that the tedium of months on the open seas could and did drive a man insane, co-directors Louise Osmond and Jerry Rothwell have done a commendable job of making Deep Water... well, not boring.",Fresh
"It is the point -- and the power -- of Deep Water that the vast, unknowable fathoms of the sea are rivaled only by those of the human psyche.",Fresh
"A true-life tale of inadvertent self-destruction, Deep Water's generic title belies its haunting incisiveness.",Fresh
"Not only is this an incredible saga of Jack London proportions, it's also a great detective tale.",Fresh
"Echoes the dark poetry of Coleridge's Ancient Mariner and Poe's Arthur Gordon Pym, men who sailed to sea in search of fortune only to encounter the abyss within themselves.",Fresh
"His story is a footnote in sailing history, to be sure, but a fascinating one.",Fresh
Humane and haunting.,Fresh
Deep Water successfully combines the pressure of the competition with an intriguing character study of the increasingly desperate Crowhurst.,Fresh
"In a sense, the subject of this film contributed a good deal of material to his cinematic biography, material that is gut-wrenchingly intimate and revelatory.",Fresh
"Nearly 40 years after he attempted to transcend his everyday life of limited horizons and money troubles, Osmond and Rothwell offer a fitting tribute to Crowhurst and his impossible dream.",Fresh
"A spooky, moving doc that chronicles the first solo attempt to circle the world by boat.",Fresh
"Deep Water is a documentary, but it's also one part adventure film, one part Greek tragedy, and one part meditation on the role of the 'hero' in modern society.",Fresh
"An enthralling documentary about an Englishman named Donald Crowhurst who, in 1968, set off on a solitary, nonstop circumnavigation of the globe.",Fresh
Deep Water's account of a modern Icarus is frighteningly clear in its perceptions and aftershocks.,Fresh
"A fascinating documentary about the first single-handed around-the-world sailing race, begins like a Boy's Own adventure tale but ends up more akin to tragedy.",Fresh
Remarkable.,Fresh
The documentary effectively blends contemporary and recent interviews with film and tape recordings made by Crowhurst aboard the Electron.,Fresh
One of this year's better studies of the human soul.,Fresh
Osmond and Rothwell do a commendable job of mining a rich archive of material.,Fresh
Osmond and Rothwell's depiction of his unraveling is an exquisitely structured drama.,Fresh
To reveal Crowhurst's decision would be to spoil a stunning tale. Deep Water is not itself comparably stunning.,Rotten
"Despite the flaws in the structure and story of Deep Water, Osmond and Rothwell display great skill at keeping their audience informed.",Fresh
One of the year's best documentaries.,Fresh
"Deep Water is a stunning documentary that not only beautifully elucidates a nearly forgotten incident but touches on crucial themes involving isolation, sanity, self-worth, impossible dreams, the nature of heroism and limits of human endurance.",Fresh
...a compelling portrait of a man who is terminally befuddled and ends up abandoning his wife and children because he can't face the music.,Fresh
A tangle of turbulent seas and emotions.,Fresh
"It is a sad, finely crafted documentary that must not be missed, if you call yourself a real film buff.",Fresh
But more startling are the original tape recordings and 16mm films made by the solitary competitors as they spent more than ten months alone trying to sail around the globe.,Fresh
"For this gripping and amazing documentary, such truth emerges not just from the facts, but also the poetry of men who redefine themselves in a risky race on small sailboats.",Fresh
"This isn't primarily an adventure story, though it's very suspenseful; it's first and foremost a profoundly sad tale of human frailty.",Fresh
"With the discovery of films and audiotape from the first solo, non-stop nautical race around the globe, Deep Water promises to take us where we have never been.",Fresh
"This was a story that made front pages in its day but has been largely lost to history, and now is brought bracingly and compellingly back to life.",Fresh
"Some beautiful shots give unexpected texture to the film, such as an underwater capture of a boat from below, with prisms of light surrounding it. And its final image is a quiet heartbreaker.",Fresh
...the less said about this film the better. It's that good.,Fresh
This well crafted and engaging documentary is a ripping yarn of a man's mansize adventure going horribly wrong.,Fresh
"This is pretty heady stuff, and it's constantly enthralling, particularly for something that has to use so much second-hand information.",Fresh
"Not merely a documentary portrait, but an engrossing drama with more twists and turns than your average thriller.",Fresh
"Deeply researched and compellingly presented, Deep Water is as much about one man's misadventures on the ocean as it is about loneliness, desperation and the danger of dreams.",Fresh
The film evokes a visceral understanding of solitude at sea.,Fresh
This is fascinating stuff... that would be better served by a magazine article or book.,Rotten
"As directed by Louise Osmond and Jerry Rothwell, the movie breezes along at a highly watchable clip, thanks to fluid, affecting intercutting of archival, black-and-white footage and present-day interviews.",Fresh
"As a portrait of obsession, competition and, finally, delusion, Deep Water is haunting and engrossing, and one of the best nonfiction movies of the year.",Fresh
"Knowing in advance how it all turned out cannot rob this remarkable movie of any of its drama, although ignorance of the events probably adds to the kick.",Fresh
The details just get stranger and stranger.,Fresh
"I do think the movie loses focus at times, but nevertheless, this is a pretty interesting story into madness.",Fresh
engaging,Fresh
"... hopefully what I write might encourage someone to seek out a film. Such is the case with Road to Victory, the debut feature of writer-director-actor Mike Reilly.",Fresh
Mike Reilly's film is so well put together and well acted that it was a joy to sit and watch what was an apparent work of love...,Fresh
...this film -- despite its penchant for black-and-white narrative when many shades of grey are needed -- needs to be seen and discussed,Rotten
The reach of this film goes beyond addressing itself to one couple or even something as broad as the whole field of sports medicine.,Rotten
"It was powerful, thought-provoking and held my interest right up to the end.",Fresh
"A film that deserves your attention, if just to note that someone is handling a serious subject like impotence with respect and to mark the debut of a multi-talented young man.",Fresh
"Resourcefully intriguing, sentimental and cunningly relevant, Road to Victory juggles its revolving subject matters with effortless candor and consideration.",Fresh
Road to Victory tackles sexual dysfunction with a delicacy that belies its gridiron backdrop.,Fresh
Reilly's directing revealed a solid eye for visual presentation and dramatic emphasis.,Fresh
"It's cute alright, with wild ideas, funny lines and a central premise that reinforces loyalty and being true to yourself. Beyond the obvious frivolity",Fresh
Actually better than its premise and its trailer might lead you to expect.,Fresh
"While it doesn't work particularly well on any of those levels, it is a colourful addition to the always popular talking dog genre.",Fresh
"The story's a bit dog-eared, but the voice cast adds plenty of energetic bite.",Fresh
Upbeat talking-animal adventure is fun for kids.,Fresh
"You could say Beverly Hills Chihuahua is Lady and the Tramp meets Viva Zapata!, but seriously, I've seen zestier attitude in a Purina commercial.",Rotten
"While CGI works its ventriloquism on the doggy mandibles, it neglects the human contingent, who are left to fend for themselves amid the manipulated menagerie.",Rotten
"The good news is that ""Beverly Hills Chihuahua"" is not the 90-minute-long ethnic joke that the incessant trailers have been promising for the last few months. The bad news is that it isn't much of anything else either.",Rotten
"Like most recent Disney movies, this one has way too much going on in it, as if the producers were assuaging their distrust of the premise with meandering subplots and unnecessary characters.",Rotten
"Portraying Mexico as a breeding ground for criminal activity, imagining the local police as incompetent fools, and encouraging lines such as ""hold your tacos!,"" the movie doesn't exactly make a strong case for racial harmony.",Rotten
"Could Cheech Marin ever have predicted that he would once again appear in a movie that features his signature song, ""Low Rider,"" and that it would be such a dog?",Rotten
"An unfunny, uninventive live-action variation on animated Disney animal adventures Lady and the Tramp, Oliver and Company and The Aristocats.",Rotten
"Once it gets the dumb 'Talk to the paw!' jokes out of its system, it's actually a reasonably charming, mostly benign kids' movie that adults can watch without their heads exploding.",Fresh
"At first glance, it seems like just another 'cute' movie where we see life through the eyes of an animal. Your first glance would actually be pretty accurate but as far as this genre goes, the kids should love it and adults won't need to keep checking the",Fresh
"Sublimely silly and oddly poignant, Beverly Hills Chihuahua -- that's right, the one with the talking canines -- is Lady and the Tramp for lap dogs, Roots for pooches, Legally Blonde told from Bruiser's point of view.",Fresh
"For kids who like dogs and grown-ups who don't mind a movie filled with pro-adopt-a-shelter-dog messages, it could theoretically be worse.",Rotten
"A painfully unfunny, virtually charmless talking-animals pic. What did the lovely Jamie Lee Curtis see in this project that she felt warranted coming out of semi-retirement for?",Rotten
"Compared to the best doggie flicks, it may be the runt of the litter, but like most mutts it grows on you.",Fresh
A surprise charmer that mixes family-friendly slapstick with shrewd adult humor.,Fresh
"Like CNN, the film assumes it needs nothing more than our unlimited interest in the drama of a white female gone missing in a foreign country.",Rotten
"Sure, it's essentially Legally Blonde told from a dog's perspective, down to Chloe's newfound self-awareness, but darned if it isn't awfully cute.",Fresh
Why?,Rotten
"In a year light on family films, this may be a good bet. Exciting adventure, admirable messages, and good, clean fun--but be warned, its bite is worse than its bark!",Rotten
Paris Hilton and lower-level office workers who own calendars featuring Weimaraners wearing hats will love it.,Rotten
"If celebrity purebred Tinkerbell sees this canine consciousness-raiser, there could be a putsch in Paris Hilton's purse.",Fresh
The real stars of this film are the dogs. The humans were lackluster in comparison. But the reality is that you can't beat talking dogs on the cuteness meter.,Fresh
[During the credits]Disney warns people to be careful when picking a dog and that all dogs deserve a good home. If only they were that concerned about their movie.,Rotten
It's hard to go wrong with a movie full of talking dogs. But the makers of Beverly Hills Chihuahua sure try.,Rotten
"For most of Beverly Hills Chihuahua, all I could think about was Drew Barrymore. What might she have been up to while she recited her lines for Chloe, the spoiled yet sad-looking live-action Chihuahua that speaks in her voice.",Rotten
"Disney is now content with the likes of the wholly inoffensive, uninventive Beverly Hills Chihuahua, whose canine antics will divert undemanding youngsters and adults who believe the simple absence of profanity, sex and violence counts as a virtue.",Rotten
"The good news: Beverly Hills Chihuahua is not the apocalypse-signaling, cultural abomination its trailers make it out to be. The bad news: That's pretty much the best thing that can be said about it.",Rotten
What appeared to have all the potential of a so-bad-it's-fun masterpiece turned out to just be an average friendly enough kid's flick that often wanders the deserts of Mexico without much direction.,Fresh
Beverly Hills Chihuahua is hardly Best in Show when it comes to Disney dog movies.,Rotten
"In the words of another famous talking dog, Beverly Hills Chihuahua looks like something for me to poop on.",Rotten
"This being Disney, wholesome character-building messages abound, but for once they're freshly spun as cautions against stereotyping both ethnic and canine.",Fresh
"A Lady and the Tramp for the Taco Bell set, Beverly Hills Chihuahua fits nicely into the long line of Disney dog movies designed to delight children and animal lovers.",Fresh
"Despite its superficial lip-service to self-actualization/realization, there has to be more to life than what Beverly Hills Chihuahua is putting out there, which is fit for neither man nor beast.",Rotten
"A live-action movie with a boatload of cute pooches that, despite bewitching effects and a charming voice cast, buries its sentiment in a too-tangled tale.",Rotten
The film is Beverly Hills Chihuahua. The audience is the fire hydrant.,Rotten
Beverly Hills Chihuahua approaches but never quite achieves a truly spectacular level of absurdity.,Rotten
"If Chihuahua is no Babe or Charlotte's Web, at least it's in the Alvin and the Chipmunks ballpark. Just remember nobody went to the pet store and grabbed a chipmunk on the way home after that one.",Rotten
"It's still only October, but I'll go ahead and say it: Beverly Hills Chihuahua is the best film of 2008 starring a purse dog.",Fresh
"Depending on your tolerance for talking Chihuahuas, this live-action comic offering from Disney could make for a fun family night out.",Fresh
Chihuahua turns out to be a pretty good family comedy that is more than the sum of its effects.,Fresh
"Most movies in the talking-dog genre -- yes, unfortunately, there are enough of them to be a genre -- feature dogs doing stand-up shtick. But the pooches in Beverly Hill Chihuahua have character, and so does the movie.",Fresh
"Aside from some obvious racial stereotypes and voices that occasionally stray into Frito Bandito territory, Chihuahua has charm to spare for the adults, while offering plenty to keep young pups enthralled.",Fresh
Ticket buyers older than 8 should simply close their eyes and ponder a more stimulating concept: Beverly Hills Cujo.,Rotten
"If I were six, maybe even seven, I think I would have adored Walt Disney Picture's talking dog comedy Beverly Hills Chihuahua.",Rotten
"As depressing as it is to find so many gifted artists reduced to making a talking-dog picture, Beverly Hills Chihuahua turns out to be genuinely sweet.",Fresh
"This anthropomorphic tale will likely please the kiddies, and the animal trainers and vocal talent are to be commended, but anyone over the age of twelve will be bored.",Rotten
"some will think this is a cute funny movie, and the rest of us will go running and screaming from the theater begging God to take away our eyesight so we never have to see it again",Rotten
A welcome surprise.,Fresh
"I spent a lot of time in the early scenes wondering how much Jamie Lee Curtis had to be paid to go on cooing in a demented way as Viv, Chloe's besotted owner.",Rotten
"The predictable story may be enough to keep dog-obsessed children entertained, assuming they don't get distressed by the pups-in-peril aspects, but for adults it's only sporadically entertaining.",Rotten
Quite sweet.,Fresh
"Delgado (voiced by Andy Garcia), a reluctantly heroic German Shepherd, definitely deserves a movie of his own! Eat your heart out, Rin Tin Tin.",Fresh
a shallow cinematic shill at best.,Rotten
"For the seven year olds out there, this is a perfectly fun movie and there's nothing that a cranky film critic can say to sour the experience.",Rotten
"Even after a slow start, this silly kiddie flick has a little more pep than you might expect. It's no doggie classic, but neither does it deserve a pooper scooper.",Fresh
"Beverly Hills Chihuahua isn't terrible. OK, it's kind of terrible, but it's a talking-dog movie, and anyone who goes to a talking-dog movie without being prepared to step in poop deserves to ruin his shoes.",Rotten
"The script's one original idea, a lost Aztec city populated solely by militant chihuahuas, comes too late to save this dog of a movie.",Rotten
In less enlightened times those responsible for making animals talk would have been burnt at the stake as sorcerers. That's why those times were known as 'the good old days.',Rotten
"Kids movies over the past few years have proven they can be just as good as grown up films (WALL*E), but this one brings us back to the drawing board.",Rotten
A doggone good movie for kids,Fresh
"Tremendously routine, in a way that an adventure film about talking Chihuahuas should not be.",Rotten
"Watch some rich folks with unbelievably pampered pets in an LA enclave make money for studio executives. What would be 'depressing' is if the 'real' world out there ever made the sight of clothed and bejewelled lapdogs talking unfunny, right?",Rotten
"It's a happy report that the preview's bark is far worse than the movie's bite. There is a Chihuahua brigade (fronted by Placido Domingo, no less), but thankfully no musical numbers. It's a modestly charming old-dog family film with few new tricks.",Fresh

"A single moment of magical realism shows the Babe-that-might-have-been, very charitably speaking, had the makers of this doggie adventure-comedy chosen a more daring and creative route...",Rotten
The terminally cutesy Chihuahua is just another demonstratively derivative kids' narrative that barks up the wrong creative tree...[a] forgettable fleabag farce...,Rotten
"... it's a lapdog of a script, all gussied up. And the Beverly Hills scenes made me want to arf.",Rotten
It kind of reaffirmed a lot of cultural stereotypes.,Rotten
It's cute and sweet and funny.,Fresh
"What doesn't make sense is that while the doggies can follow human speech, the humans don't get pooch talk, it's all Yap-Yapanese.",Fresh
"It's hugely silly, but peppy enough to be tolerable. What grates most are the patronising racial stereotypes: the dirty Mexican dogs are just waiting to be rescued by LA ladies and given a good bath.",Rotten
"Younger audiences will adore this canine caper, though grown-ups might feel its one joke is stretched too far.",Fresh
"In a triumph of animal wrangling and CGI tinkering, the canine cast turn in better performances than some of the humans.",Rotten
This piece of egregious silliness from Disney - featuring live-action canines with CGI moving mouths - isn't quite as awful as it sounds.,Rotten
"Not that anybody would expect perfection from a film called Beverly Hills Chihuahua, but the chewed bone of a story makes it all mutts ado about nothing.",Rotten
"A state-of-the-art kid-pleaser for sure, but recession-weary parents will probably find it a mite obnoxious.",Fresh
"This live-action Disney comedy is the kind of family film which is aimed not so much at parents, as small children and their goldfish, as long as the goldfish do not have too long an attention span.",Rotten
"In truth, this good-natured Disney comedy is an engaging romp.",Fresh
Only watch this if you adore seeing dogs wearing shades.,Rotten
It's put across with enough brio to excuse the inherent stupidity of the premise.,Fresh
"You want to cringe as the picture begins, but you end up quite enjoying it.",Rotten
"Watchable, largely average family movie, enlivened by decent performances and the occasionally surreal, off-the-wall moment.",Fresh
"Silly beyond reason, it somehow manages to win us over despite our doubts, and by the end we're ashamed that we can't stop giggling.",Rotten
An appealing film for dog lovers and those seeking escapist entertainment.,Fresh

...ultimately about as enthralling as a low-rent Saturday morning cartoon.,Rotten
"A kid's film doesn't have to be an all time classic to be watchable - once anyway - for the whole audience. No one in Beverly Hills Chihuahua seems to care enough to bother. And if they don't care, why should I?",Rotten
"Be they 50% warrior, 50% lover or 100% Chihuahua, the one thing you will all agree on is that BEVERLY HILLS CHIHUAHUA is 100% cute, 100% adorable, 100% entertaining and 110% fun.",Fresh
Director Raja Gosnell actually makes this film work far better than one might expect it to work.,Rotten

"Despite the mega-wattage of pic's starry cast, theatrical prospects seem dim for this clumsy melodrama, which looks and sounds no better than an average made-for-cabler.",Rotten
"The movie is one long argument, tiresome and repetitive, that produces more heat than light.",Rotten
"As tales of troubled families go, it may have aspirations to be like Ordinary People, but it falls way short.",Rotten
"A movie tomb in which zombiedom is confused with - what's the phrase? - ""nuanced performances"". Fireflies may be a douche to freshen up the thesp skills of A-listers, but why do we have to suffer for their art?",Rotten
"Doesn't really have a plot, but it cleverly traces the interrelationships in a family over several years, and really gets under the skin",Fresh
It lacks dramatic impact and fails to deliver the required emotional punch.,Rotten
"We're in the twilight land of the sensitive indie ensemble piece, something American stars gravitate to for reasons of range and prestige, but which ends up being more cathartic for them than for us.",Rotten
"It's not a bad film - Lee directs with subtle grace and the cast is predictably strong - but it's saddled with too many characters, not enough drama and a strong sense of overfamiliarity.",Rotten
"This is a slog of a melodrama. And with at least four sob stories competing for space, characters are left dangling like untied shoelaces, as backstories remain unfertilised.",Rotten
"Julia Roberts, Willem Dafoe and Emily Watson are strictly slumming it in this saccharine melodrama.",Rotten
A sickly sweet family drama stuffed with exceptionally high-profile performers - so much so that they threaten to overwhelm it just by their presence.,Rotten
"A heavy, entertaining but slightly forgettable family drama.",Rotten
"The entire experience feels like it is leading up to a dramatic and well-needed climax, but sadly this never materialises and what we're left with is a run-of-the-mill yarn, albeit one with a stellar cast.",Rotten
It may be both both melancholy and intense but it packs an emotional jolt as the prodigal son reaches an understanding - if not a full-blown reunion - with his crotchety old man.,Fresh
"An impressive ensemble lends heft and humour to this sprawling potboiler. Watchable if never truly memorable, it's a mid-range work for most involved that still affords the odd guilty pleasure.",Fresh
"A sheer slog to sit through, Fireflies In The Garden might have worked if it wasn't so damn po-faced and the script actually had something to say about how families work.",Rotten
The elements are all there but never fully click into place - more like a TV movie than a big-screen drama.,Rotten
A thoughtful tale but it is not original enough to provide a long-lasting glow.,Fresh
"Consistently watchable and sometimes rather moving, although it is a rather slighter piece than the film-makers seem to think.",Fresh
"An agonisingly sincere drama of familial dysfunction, this is notable for some very basic miscasting.",Rotten
Dennis Lee's sentimental drama is full of big stars and good intentions but still winds up feeling no better than a tear-jerking television soap opera.,Rotten
Eminently watchable but instantly forgettable.,Fresh
"A resolutely middlebrow dysfunctional family melodrama, it's one of those tediously self-congratulatory movies that projects an unearned air of superiority simply because it's not another slam-bang summer blockbuster.",Rotten
"They stagger down memory lane for a little bloodletting, inspect skeletons in the cupboard and invariably end up bathing together in a hot tub of sentimental forgiveness and understanding.",Rotten
A watchable but ultimately blah family drama.,Fresh
"It's a tragedy, in all of the wrong ways.",Rotten
"Despite an A-list roster, the performances are universally one-note, a fact largely attributable to a script overflowing with blunt dialogue and heavy-handed symbolism.",Rotten
"the only thing more false in ""Fireflies in the Garden"" than its flaccid melodrama is its clichd emotional redemption.",Rotten
There's a sense of emotional paralysis about Dennis Lee's Fireflies in the Garden.,Rotten
"The relationships are lived-in and complex, with the same hopelessness that we find in real life. People don't change.",Fresh
Lee doesn't trust his storytelling or the audience.,Rotten
"""Fireflies"" is probably too convoluted to pave the way for more roles of this sort, but watching Reynolds get inside Michael's pain, you hope it won't be long until something will.",Rotten
"Those who naturally gravitate to this syrupy genre shouldn't be disappointed, as Fireflies in the Garden is consistent with tender moments and agonized recollections.",Fresh
Has all the personality and forward momentum of a cardboard box.,Rotten
[A] middling effort about the fights and reconnections experienced by a family gathered due to an unexpected tragedy...,Rotten
"A fraught family drama that shows us the same family in past and present, 22 years apart. It might have been more effective if it had followed a chronological order.",Rotten
Julia Roberts plays ultra-sensitive artiste Ryan Reynolds' noble mother-and that should basically tell you all you need to know about this misguided soapy bunch of bollocks which somehow made its way off the shelf into theatres.,Rotten
"This locally shot weeper is unhappy in myriad ways, few of which manage to coalesce around its heart-stung core.",Rotten
The emotional effectiveness varies from moment to moment between not pushing too hard or simply not pulling hard enough.,Rotten
This stale drama is finally getting a limited release and will prove just how limited it is to the poor saps who pay to see it.,Rotten
A dreadful exercise in navel-gazing that resides in a particularly trite corner of Pat Conroy-ville.,Rotten
A dispiriting rehash of dysfunctional family clichs that seems to last longer than Thanksgiving Day dinner.,Rotten
"The actors are all good and a few scenes -- an opening family argument, a crucial battle when Michael finally fights back -- are painfully moving.",Fresh
An unrelentingly grim drama about yet another dysfunctional family.,Rotten
It just comes off a little false.,Rotten
The constant shifting between past and present is handled so badly that it adds absolutely nothing to the proceedings.,Rotten
"Just when you're hitting your tolerance breaking point for these people and their nonstop bellyaching and yelling and baffling hatred for one another, the equally baffling reconciliation kicks in. What just happened?",Rotten
"This histrionic family drama must have looked good on paper to attract such a big-name cast, but on the screen it comes off as glib, rushed, and underdeveloped.",Rotten
"Uneven drama about unhappy family, including tragedy.",Rotten
"One of those dysfunctional family melodramas in which a dysfunctional family gets all melodramatic, and here is what I would say to this family if I could: ""Get over it or, failing that, go away and bother someone else.""",Rotten
"The strength of Fireflies in the Garden undoubtedly lies in its casting, although [Dennis] Lee directs his starry cast with confidence and flair and this should lead on to bigger and better things for the young film-maker.",Fresh
"Dull, clich√©d, and silly, this is yet another watered-down slice of horror cinema that will score big with teenage girls under the age of fifteen.",Rotten
"Although star Jessica Alba is undoubtedly easy on the eyes, this remake of a Chinese neo-classic is far too easy on the nerves.",Rotten
"Quite faithful until the dumbed-down Americanized ending, yet time and again the treatment is inferior.",Rotten
You'd think that a horror story concerned with the unreliability of sight might at least try to generate scares via the use of visual trickery.,Rotten
"Good special effects and some scary characters put together with great cinematography make this one notch up from a B horror film. Turn off those cell phones now, boys and girls.",Fresh
It's hard to know who bears the brunt of the blame for The Eye's stunning dullness.,Rotten
"Jessica Alba is floundering here, forced to spit out idiotic dialogue and make goo-goo eyes toward cold fish Nivola; not to mention she's one half of the most implausible pair of siblings committed to the big screen seen since Schwarzenegger and DeVito.",Rotten
"Considering The Eye was held from critics for review, it turned out to be surprisingly decent - much better than the putrid One Missed Call",Fresh
I spy with my little eye another unnecessary remake of an Asian horror movie.,Rotten
"The shocks are all cheap, the ending is ludicrous, and echoes of earlier movies are rampant, from Repulsion to The Sixth Sense.",Rotten
A tediously noisesome English-language remake of an Asian horror picture that wasn't any great shakes to begin with.,Rotten
Alba is so believable as a woman thrown out of her comfort zone... that it's actually a disappointment when the plot kicks in.,Rotten
Seeing isn't believing.,Rotten
"What's worse than a bad American remake of a terrifying Asian horror movie? Why, a bad American remake of a crappy Asian horror movie, of course.",Rotten
stupendously bad,Rotten
Someone else should have seen the obvious hurdle of making a horror movie that relies solely on Jessica Alba's acting abilities.,Rotten
Even an experienced viewer of supernatural pics will get an occasional jolt: I got mine from watching Jessica Alba's character about to push her right eye out of its socket.,Fresh
...turns things upside down for a horror movie - you want to be alone in the dark.,Fresh
"Despite some good, shocking visual images, the execution leaves much to be desired, and overall this remake is not as effective as the 2003 Hong Kong original--or the helmers' first (French) feature, Them.",Rotten
"The Eye never aspires to be anything more than slick sleepover fodder, but at least that qualifies as a step up for Alba.",Rotten
"...it doesn't suck. It's far from brilliant, but as weekend multiplex popcorn fare, it mostly gets the job done.",Fresh
"Not spectacular, not a waste, it's clever enough to keep its momentum going, and smart enough to not overreach its mission of being a diverting 90 minutes or so",Fresh
One of the less awful horror remakes in recent years.,Rotten
You're better off avoiding any eye contact with this movie.,Rotten
The fatal flaw with The Eye is that it is a bland and boring work that is the cinematic equivalent of a dead light bulb.,Rotten
"Neither a good movie nor a bad movie, The Eye is just ... a movie, sitting there unnecessarily.",Fresh
The Eye remake rolls off Hollywood's Asian horror assembly line like expired goods that have been repackaged.,Rotten
A poorly acted and instantly forgettable supernatural thriller.,Rotten
"Alba is very good at looking very good... but she's quite terrible at looking very scared, or very traumatized...",Rotten
"The feel-good Japanese horror remake vehicle of the year! No, that's a bad thing.",Rotten
Just be prepared to suspend your disbelief a little more than usual.,Fresh
"A film of no distinction of any kind, destined only to fill the late hours at some 10-year-olds' sleepover party.",Rotten

An effective if redundant fright flick.,Fresh
"When it comes to showing something to end the second-rate horror drought, The Eye is blind.",Rotten
"The major problem is the death of a horror film: It's startling, but not particularly scary.",Rotten
"The most frightening aspect of this supernatural horror film -- a remake of the 2002 Hong Kong thriller -- is that there was a 114-minute version, before someone took pity and snipped it down to a lugubrious 97.",Rotten
"Ever had a premonition of imminent catastrophe, only to watch helplessly as the worst unfolds? You have if you saw the previews for this snoozer of a paranormal shocker and bought a ticket anyway.",Rotten
Further proof that those fueling the Hollywood remake machine are the ones who could really stand to have their vision restored.,Rotten
Yet another inferior remake of an Asian horror film.,Rotten
"Therapy for this fright-free, superdull remake of a stylish Hong Kong horror flick is probably not covered by your HMO.",Rotten
"The movie is watchable -- never more gratuitously so than when Alba is filmed showering and slipping into a tank top. But we've been here before, no?",Rotten
"The most vivid aspect of The Eye is its poster image, that of a huge female eye with a human hand gripping the lower lid from the inside. The least vivid aspect is the way Jessica Alba delivers a simple line of expository dialogue.",Rotten
The Eye is the latest Western deconstruction of a successful Asian horror movie and it is louder and more literal than its inspiration.,Rotten
"The script is credited to Sebastian Gutierrez, who penned Snakes On a Plane, a movie that knew how to have scares and sex and a bit of fun. What happened?",Rotten
"The film's directors, David Moreau and Xavier Palud, bring nothing new to the table, and they aren't even particularly adept at reheating the leftovers.",Rotten
"does deserve points for an atmospheric first hour, it's undone by bad acting and a pedestrian ending.",Rotten
"I operate under the belief that horror movies should be scary or, at the very least, surprising. The Eye is neither of those, although it is diverting and not without some entertaining moments. I'm on this fence about this one.",Rotten
A thin premise frays the audience's patience.,Rotten
"Directors David Moreau and Xavier Palud ... and screenwriter Sebastian Gutierrez ... cleave very close to the [original Hong Kong] film in many ways, yet the result is far less satisfying.",Rotten
"The real movie is Jessica Alba as a blind girl... Even the story of an eye transplant recipient would be cool, watching her adjust to the world of vision. Luckily, the bulk of the movie is that. That makes it classy and grown-up.",Fresh
The Eye contains little worth seeing.,Rotten
"Moreau and Palud decide to trade in the creepy, atmospheric style of the Pang Brothers for a more amped up Hollywood approach...it fails to distinguish itself either as a remake or on its own terms as a horror film.",Rotten
Alba's performance is rather limp...,Rotten
The cornea-deprived caper The Eye definitely sports a blurry vision in the meager horror B-movie sweepstakes...never sees clearly in its search for doomsday enlightenment.,Rotten
Um exemplo perfeito da diferen√ßa entre um filme que recicla os elementos do g√™nero terror de maneira criativa e outro que apenas se limita a copi√°-los.,Rotten
Seeing is disbelieving.,Rotten

Transforming Asian horror into American horror isn't so bad when the filmmakers respect the source material.,Fresh

"The latest American remake of an Eastern import in which the thrills have been hopelessly squandered in translation, replaced with distracting, rapid-fire camerawork and thunderous bumps in the night that reflect a kind of creative desperation.",Rotten
"Lionsgate has delivered a solid PG-13 horror film that's both entertaining and suspenseful... and for those of you who don't like it, there will be more SAW on October 24.",Fresh
"With every twist of the second-hand plot telegraphed far in advance, you don't need to be clairvoyant to see where this is going.",Rotten
Effectively creepsome until it bogs down somewhat in plot explication.,Fresh
"Alba simply isn't good enough to carry this kind of movie, and lacks the presence to counter the major deficiencies of a weak and feeble ghost story.",Rotten
One can't turn a blind eye to such conspicuous failings.,Rotten
"There are a couple of effective scares, but this feels like a retread too far. Enough with J-horror already - let's do something new.",Rotten
"A terrifying treat for horror junkies, as Alba's nervous wreck visionary wards off being attacked by apartments and restaurants, while dealing with a bad case of occult organ rejection.",Fresh
...it doesn't leave us with much more than a feeling that we've been there and seen it all before.,Rotten
...ultimately establishes itself as the most effective endeavor of its kind since 2005's Dark Water.,Fresh
"Terrible direction, forgettable performances, and writers who are so faithful to the source material that they even pick up the original film's plot holes...",Rotten
"It's all based on the creepy little Chinese film Gin gwai, an atmospheric spine-tingler that, we're sad to say, is considerably more frightening than this tame effort.",Rotten
"It creates a good atmosphere, but no tension. The movie is just not memorable.",Rotten
"Jessica Alba may be easy on the eyes, but a lack of dramatic heft makes her hard on The Eye.",Rotten
Jessica Alba sees dead people in blah horror film.,Rotten
Turns out seeing dead people can still be kind of a thrill.,Fresh
"Brothers Danny and Oxide Pang's unnerving spook show from 2002 has been translated into a clunky, aimless interpretation that leaves you with just one overpowering thought: are Jessica Alba's lips for real?",Rotten
Takes a B-- import and turns it into a D-- retread.,Rotten
"Along with Posey's disappointing turn here, Nivola is uncomfortably weak.",Rotten
"No matter how you slice it, this one is just plain dead on arrival.",Rotten
"Nowhere near the worst zombie movie I've ever seen, but it will follow in the slew of truly atrocious remakes undeserving of their titles...",Rotten
It's a pageant of stupidity that hopes gushing wounds and deliberate fanboy-catnip slices of ultraviolent cheese will mask the reality that it's a worthless offering in an increasingly abused genre.,Rotten
"It's such a fun zombie movie, I'm amazed it didn't get a full theatrical release.",Fresh
The only possible response to the benighted thing is pity.,Rotten
A chaotic mess of violence and gore...,Rotten
Incompetent in every respect.,Rotten
"The plot is all over the place. The special effects are pulsing, nausea-inducing, amateurish, and laughable, and they tried too hard to make the zombies different from those who came before.",Rotten
"It's disturbing to think of the millions of teenage boys who will laugh when he insults a girl to get her in bed, or pees in a cactus plant at a restaurant.",Rotten
"Eventually the conventions of romantic comedy take hold, with the humor declining precipitously.",Rotten
"Cook is most amusing while emphasizing his sardonic edginess, a trait that may eventually serve him well in some anti-heroic (or downright villainous) dramatic role. Better still, he establishes an effectively fluid give-and-take with Hudson.",Fresh
"My Best Friend's Girl isn't just a misfire; it's a misfire compounded by a chain of miscalculations, and it's hard to figure out who this could appeal to (except, perhaps, Dane Cook's fan club).",Rotten
"The actors (especially Alec Baldwin, as Tank's horndog dad) elevate the material slightly, but such piffle will just fill you with longing... for a better movie.",Rotten
"The movie spends a lot of time trying to be cute, vulgar and cutely vulgar. But it forgets about character, plot and believability.",Rotten
Isolated bits don't add up to much here.,Rotten
"Want to spend a seemingly endless 100 minutes watching a dullard trying to decide between a douchebag and a eunuch? Then run, don't walk, to My Best Friend's Girl, a supremely irritating movie about idiots and their dull quest for unconvincing love",Rotten
"In trying to play to both Cook's raunch-loving fanbase and to hopeless romantics, director Howard Deutch has made an awkward half-breed that's likely to alienate both camps.",Rotten
"There could be a supporting turn from Will Smith, gas cards under every theater seat, and certified proof who killed JFK revealed only after the end credits and it still wouldn't salvage Cook's ability to select the worst possible starring vehicles.",Rotten
It attempts to go all warm and fuzzy. It succeeds. But it is the warm and fuzzy stuff that grows on a compost heap after a heavy rain,Rotten
"The movie is mirthlessly vulgar, with only a few scattered laughs escaping from the miasma of desperation.",Rotten
"A trophy hottie who can't get enough of all the crude sexual insults this lowlife male pig - without lipstick - is dispensing as effective foreplay, while succumbing to his extreme dirty talk as the ultimate aphrodisiac.",Rotten
"A light smattering of funny moments can't save this misogynistic, feel-bad romantic comedy.",Rotten
"A nauseating fraud from start to finish ... The film's level of awfulness is nothing new for Cook, but Hudson hits a new low.",Rotten
My Best Friend's Girl ultimately fails to measure up to its own standards.,Rotten
"In order for My Best Friend's Girl to work at all, it needs a leading man with the charisma to suggest the soulful, lovelorn gentleman behind the crude serial womanizer.",Rotten
The inexplicable romantic comedy career of Dane Cook marches on.,Rotten
The movie can't seem to follow its own internal logic.,Rotten
"There are no surprises here, but speedy pacing and a smattering of laughs along the way, as well as a knowing turn by Alec Baldwin as Tank's even more piggish father, make My Best Friend's Girl a date not entirely to be skipped.",Fresh
"Ultimately, its most unforgivable sin is that it's simply not funny.",Rotten
"An ugly, strictly-for-meatheads comedy that can only be recommended to couples who wear matching Tie Domi Toronto Maple Leafs jerseys out on a date.",Rotten
"It lacks the courage of its swinish convictions, and abruptly acquiesces to bland rom-com clichs three-quarters of the way to its appointed end.",Rotten
"It borrows from much funnier movies such as Hitch, Wedding Crashers and My Best Friend's Wedding. Never has a romantic comedy seemed less romantic or less comedic.",Rotten
"Golden Girl Kate Hudson gets tarnished by associating with Dane Cook in this tasteless, terrible movie",Rotten
Raunchy and wretched...profoundly unfunny and sophomoric sludge...meaningless material that wouldn't be suitable for lining your pet parrot's birdcage.,Rotten
Cahan's curious and increasingly sincere slant on modern romance outshines its efforts to please Cook's MySpace fan base with gross-out gags (some of which are damned funny).,Fresh
It's a movie that ultimately fails because it features characters that are so unlikeable that it's difficult to care whether they form a love connection or not,Rotten
"When it comes right down to it, the less said about the movie the better. But in lieu of that, let's just tackle it, vilify it, screw it to the wall, and send it back into the sewer from which it came.",Rotten
Induces that dull pain at the back of the head that I believe to be the result of brain cells crawling away to die of embarrassment.,Rotten
"An insulting, wholly unpleasant excuse for a comedy.",Rotten
Hitch has nothing on My Best Friend's Girl... the best romance since The Notebook.,Fresh
"Mean, crass and tasteless, ""My Best Friend's Girl"" is only pretending to be a romantic comedy.",Rotten
[Director Howard] Deutch passes the buck to his three stars...,Rotten
... this is a verbally poisonous comedy that rattles the sensibility cage.,Rotten
"It's coarse and funny, but there's something really endearing about this twisted romantic comedy in which the protagonist excels at being a self-proclaimed emotional terrorist",Fresh
"A raunchy vehicle for Dane Cook fans? A sprightly romance for Kate Hudson fans? A genial underdog comedy for Jason Biggs fans? The correct answer is: a big, steaming pile of horse manure.",Rotten
"It works much better as a comedy, but by the end, the romantic aspect has taken over and there's not much humor to be found after the first half.",Rotten
"'There's this guy, Tank, and other guys hire him to give their exes ""emotional terrorism."" It's a romantic comedy.''Can you throw in a cheap anti-Catholic and anti-Semitic joke? And have Tank tell some kids how to pull a brutal sexaul trick on a woman?'",Rotten
"A rude, crude romantic comedy with a touch of nastiness that's refreshing and quite funny.",Fresh
You should steer well clear of the nasty ideas that screenwriter Jordan Cahan has about relationships and how they work.,Rotten
A film that truly bites.,Rotten
"Dane Cook proves why he is one of American comedy's favourite big-time naughty boys in this fast, funny, foul-tongued but sweet-natured adult-skewed romantic comedy.",Fresh
"The film veers off into that realm of unbelievability that I react against. But there is a certain fascination in watching Cook strut his stuff (and boy does he strut), and Kate Hudson is pleasant to watch.",Fresh
"If you like watching anarchy in action, this exhibition has its moments, but the anti-woman humour underpinning it -- and Cook's whole performance -- does cast a pall.",Rotten
Any schmuck with a typewriter and a dirty mouth can test the limits of good taste; it's something else entirely to push the boundaries of narrative possibility and emotional empathy.,Rotten
Yet another in a continuing line of dismal Dane Cook so-called romantic comedies.,Rotten
It's a wonder the guys don't just wear Flintstone loincloths. Now let's hear it: Yabba-dabba-don't.,Rotten
This is one of those films that would be enormously improved by the arrival of 100 crazy Somali pirates who would proceed to take the entire cast hostage.,Rotten
"Tedious, largely unfunny and poorly written comedy with the least likeable collection of characters you'll see all year.",Rotten
"There's something genuinely transgressive beneath the movie's rom-com surface, though director Howard Deutch keeps retreating to the safety of frat-boy humor.",Rotten
mostly unwatchable,Rotten

"Inane, raunchy romantic comedy inspires no love.",Rotten
"Devoid of any heart, My Best Friend's Girl relies on schoolboy toilet humour to maintain interest.",Rotten
J.T Petty takes viewers on an unusual and frightening venture into the Old West with The Burrowers.,Fresh
"Beautifully shot and tightly scripted, it's the rare Hollywood genre film that's more concerned with human relationships and behavior than the mysterious supernatural forces that sets the action in motion.",Fresh
"The pacing is too pokey by half, and the payoff is a wrenching disappointment.",Rotten
"Sets you up for 'predictability' in both the western and horror departments, and then subverts those expectations time and again.",Fresh
"At his most placid, JT Petty can make Terrence Malick look like Guy Ritchie. But when he's not going full-'bore', his quiet, creepy brand of terror works on several levels.",Fresh
...a sporadically entertaining yet thoroughly ineffective misfire.,Rotten
"Petty is pursuing a more measured, sympathetic take on demons that feast on the gelatinous innards of innocent victims, manufacturing a tediously wandering picture that craves substance while itching to entertain its absurd grindhouse sensibilities.",Rotten
rewarding both as a horror film and a period piece.,Fresh
... proves once again that the old west still isn't the ideal place to set a monster movie.,Fresh
Director J.T Petty's nasty romp followed up Alex Turner's Dead Birds (2004) and preceeded John Geddes Exit Humanity (2011) in the Old West/monster movie mash-up genre; it may well be the best of them.,Fresh

"MEAT TRAIN is the first BOOK OF BLOOD to depart from the station in a long time and it's refreshing to see that the film carries that bleak, yet romantic touch of Clive Barker all over it... it's guaranteed to make you squirm, scream and beg for more!",Fresh
Manages to maintain that sly sense of dread that permeates the best of Barker's horror tales. Certainly one of the most effective horror films of the year.,Fresh
"We've all been here before: scarcely-lit, acid-washed cinematography; dreamlike storytelling; absurdly pitched performances; a lauded Asian filmmaker making his American debut; and plenty of CG snap to the bloodletting.",Rotten
An efficient slasher with a surprisingly slow build-up and a decent amount of originality. Plus the best use of Vinnie Jones in any movie,Fresh
Public-transit terror tale is beyond bloody. Pass.,Rotten
"Before flying off the rails in the final curve, The Midnight Meat Train rolls quite smoothly as a mid-'80s-style psycho-killer thriller a la The Hitcher.",Fresh
"It was a pretty neat concept, but it has such a bad script and bogged down with horrendous acting that I can't say it's a good movie",Rotten
"More interesting than most of the torture-porn or Asian-inspired thrillers that make it to theaters these days, but its tired combination of incongruously pretty fashion-mag photography and outrageously gruesome digital effects is dead on arrival.",Rotten
"We hate to side with the big bad studio, but The Midnight Meat Train -- despite a great title -- really does stink like month-old human flesh.",Rotten
This sharp and brutal little yarn about a photographer who stumbles across a serial killer is a fan film if every there was one -- and only fans will be able to stomach it.,Fresh
"Japanese cult director Ryuhei Kitamura maintains impressive control of the story, ratcheting up tension toward well-prepared and startling bursts of terror.",Fresh
"Destined to be a cult classic as a vicious, brilliant, and disgusting horror film...",Fresh
Midnight Meat Train can best be described as splatter noir. It's Fritz Lang by way of an abattoir.,Fresh
"a stylishly bloody descent into madness, murder and Hell itself.",Fresh
The film hurtles towards the final 'revelation moment' like runaway train. If only it had stopped to take on board some of Barker's heavy mythical dread.,Fresh
"Unfairly buried by its distributors in the US, this film takes what could have been a drab set-up and gives it some real bravado, energy and creativity.",Fresh
The Midnight Meat Train is destined for cult status as an minor horror gem.,Fresh
"Japanese director Ryuhei Kitamura, who kicked off his career with 2000's impressive micro-budget zombie flick Versus, delivers plenty of stylish visuals and an admirably unrestrained attitude to gore.",Rotten
"while skimpy on characterization and plot, it should please gorehounds and Barker fans alike",Rotten
Goes full speed on ultra-gory rails before slamming to an abrupt stop.,Rotten
"This is the best Clive Barker-inspired movie in a long, long time -- probably since ""Hellraiser III"" in 1992.",Fresh

Midnight Meat Train brings an unabashed brutality to the horror genre.,Fresh
Not at all Butchered.,Fresh
"Midnight Meat Train may be no classic of the genre, but it's certainly a better and more interesting film than most of what passes for horror movies these days.",Fresh
"It's excessively and imaginatively gory, presented in a straightforward manner, but with the slightest hint of a wink.",Fresh
So thoroughly coated in over-the-top blood and guts that even veteran genre fans will likely be astounded.,Fresh
"this devilishly ambiguous thriller leaves viewers to decide whether to take the conventional or the less-traveled tunnel through its narrative network - and the results are a stylishly bloody descent into madness, murder and hell itself.",Fresh
"A bloody psycho thriller that derails in the third act with the addition of the supernatural, but until that point is amazingly realistic and alarming.",Fresh
Initially intriguing yet ultimately atrocious...,Rotten
"Overall, I recommend the film, you may or may not find it a bit dry.",Fresh
There is a sprightly energy to the proceedings and a neat twist that makes this mindless fun something of a guilty pleasure.,Fresh
"Easily one of 2008's most pleasant, if one dares to call such a film pleasant, surprises.",Fresh
"Soldiers deserve a better tribute than this trite, phony dreck.",Rotten
"It's hard to find the genuine heartfelt moments in The Lucky Ones, a story about three Iraq War soldiers on a brief road trip back in the U.S., under the clutter of narrative contrivances and coincidences.",Rotten
"The drama's one glaring weakness is that its contrivances are far too obvious...Despite that, the unexpectedly light, sometimes humorous story is still enormously affecting.",Fresh
"Sometimes, however, empty, contrived fantasies are just empty, contrived fantasies, as is certainly the case with this embarrassingly phony cross between Grace Is Gone, Home of the Brave and, believe it or not, Twister.",Rotten
"It isn't unpleasant to spend two hours with these three soldiers, although it might have been more enjoyable to spend the time getting to know them rather than force-feeding them artificial road bumps.",Rotten
"Though Iraq War is in the background, Lucky Ones is yet another disappointing 9/11 film; it's a known fact that for a road picture to work, you need interesting encounters, revelations, self-discoveries, humor and color, all of which are in short supply",Rotten
It's something of a well-intentioned mess.,Rotten
"Perhaps if The Lucky Ones wasn't so crammed with incidents, the absurd coincidences wouldn't be so grating.",Rotten
"The Lucky Ones isn't dull, and the actors do quite nicely, especially McAdams, who's feisty, gorgeous, and as mercurial as a mood ring.",Fresh
It's finally all too familiar.,Rotten
"Even when it feels contrived, The Lucky Ones is enhanced by Mr. Pea, Ms. McAdams and especially the terrific, always surprising Mr. Robbins, in performances so likable and well timed they carry you aloft, like a flag.",Fresh
A refreshing departure from the normal 'soldier's story' movies we've seen in recent years.,Fresh
"With one head-gnawing plot contrivance after another, it may think it's the wacky Iraq version of Easy Rider but is more like this year's Around the Bend or Diamonds.",Rotten

"Writer/director Neil Burger...takes a big step back with ""The Lucky Ones,"" a sitcomy road movie that throws together three hard luck Iraq war vets.",Rotten
"The actual lucky ones will be sitting in a different movie theater, watching anything but this.",Rotten
"In the same way much conventional wisdom about the war is half-baked, The Lucky Ones is awash in stereotypes and generalities.",Rotten
"Director Neil Burger keeps things light, and the actors are more than engaging. ... But there's something centrally pat and predictable about the coincidence-laden story.",Fresh
"If a couple of the plot devices seem contrived, The Lucky Ones makes up for them with sharp, heartfelt performances, and a deceptively easygoing narrative style.",Fresh
"Lucky might have its heart in the right place trying to soften the image of the average Iraq War soldier, but this is a clumsy, insufferable feature film of excessive formula and embarrassing dramatic development.",Rotten
A thoughtful study on the way foreign wars can reverberate here at home.,Fresh
"This formula is fraught with pitfalls, but the characters and the actors redeem it with a surprising emotional impact.",Fresh
"If The Lucky Ones wants to seem like anything more than war vets thrust into a sitcom, it should try going five minutes without a contrivance.",Rotten
"The plot functions in a rudimentary fashion setting up one contrived complication after another, engendering a desire, despite a few amusing scenes and pleasant company, for the trio to arrive at their respective destinations as soon as possible.",Rotten
The Lucky Ones takes a decent premise -- three soldiers returning from Iraq facing domestic challenges upon their arrival home -- and crams so much forced drama into it that the movie devolves into a hack buddy picture.,Rotten
So laid-back and plain that the film leaves almost no impression at all.,Rotten
"Rachel McAdams keeps reminding me how good she is in every role she takes. In this movie, she just glows energy. Acting is one thing. How do you project energy? Through joy, anger and curiosity, she projects this vibe and she is the backbone of the film.",Fresh
"Based on the evidence here, director/co-writer Neil Burger may be the last American who's ambivalent about the Iraq War, and his movie suffers for it.",Rotten
"While their circumstances may be forced, the three characters feel like real, complex, likable people. That's a real rarity in a film about veterans, no matter what the ideology is.",Fresh
"There are so many little touches, so many delicate nuances that constantly amaze and inspire, that by the time it was over I almost didn't want their story to come to an end.",Fresh
"This is not the worst of the Iraq-themed movies of the past few years, and it's possibly the best acted of any of them. But you wish the bonding of these three people wasn't diluted by the trite scenarios and artificial circumstances of their saga.",Rotten
The dialogue is often sharp and funny and the performances nicely pitched.,Fresh
"As they hit the road, the scenes play out like TV sitcom vignettes with little holding the centre together. We find out details about the characters lives, but never feel we know them.",Rotten
Each secret is more implausible than the last.,Rotten
"McAdams and Pea are affectingly vulnerable, while Robbins convinces as a family man with strong paternal instincts.",Fresh
The Lucky Ones has plenty of heart and courage. If it only had a brain ...,Rotten
"In the end, they laugh together, they cry together and they all learn a little something about this place we call America. At least, that was probably the plan.",Rotten
"Like its lead characters, Lucky is wounded, lost, and impractical, but it has a messy, winning humanity and an agreeably leisurely pace that almost redeems it.",Fresh
"It gets so preoccupied with all the local color and colorful locals, that it forgets about the people on this journey -- or their ultimate destination.",Rotten
"Cheap, ignorant, tone-deaf and condescending.",Rotten
Its lack of emotional thrust doesn't inspire the viewer to feel one way or another.,Rotten
"As entertainment, the film works sporadically, though Burger never finds a rhythm.",Rotten
"Director and co-writer Neil Burger's drama uses the war as a springboard to tell a darkly funny, and sometimes profoundly moving, story of the men and women who are the warriors.",Fresh
It's all merely unbelievable.,Rotten
How unusual. How enjoyable.,Fresh
"The chemistry between the three soldiers is strong, but their journey rings hollow.",Rotten
The story (by director Burger and Dirk Wittenborn) contains too many coincidences and convergences to wholly ring true.,Rotten
"By structuring this as a comic road movie, writer-director Neil Burger manages to examine the emotional isolation of returning vets without sinking into a bog of despair.",Fresh
What gives these episodes cumulative impact is the group portrait that emerges of a well-meaning country in a state of drift.,Fresh
[A] far-fetched take on Iraq War homecomings.,Rotten
"With a smooth, light touch, The Lucky Ones focuses on the idea that the present and the people who factor into it are all we really have.",Fresh
Three Army soldiers on the road in America bond together through a series of preposterous happenings that come across as silly.,Rotten
"Of its genre, it's uncommonly good, and it's also the cheeriest movie about Iraq war vets I've yet seen.",Fresh
"After running through some pretty contrived paces for much of its running time, The Lucky Ones has some surprises in the last act that ultimately make it more satisfying than it might have been.",Rotten
I'm sure a lot of bad fiction has been written about veterans and current soldiers in the Iraq War. It's just not that often that it gets shot and projected on to a big screen.,Rotten
The predictable plotting in this well-intentioned salute would be excusable if the dialogue weren't so superficial.,Rotten
"The biggest disappointment is in this script, written by Dirk Wittenborn and Neil Burger who gave us the delightful Illusionistin 2006.",Rotten
... reductive and unfunny ... think Coming Home crossed with Vegas Vacation - Cousin Eddie ...,Rotten
...benefits substantially from the strength and charisma of its three leads...,Fresh
War/road trip dramedy is cliched but affecting.,Fresh
"The Iraq war has thus far produced no truly memorable dramatic movies, as opposed to documentaries, and the losing streak continues with The Lucky Ones.",Rotten
"The direction is functional, workmanlike; Burger never steals the spotlight from his characters.",Fresh
Ultimately I was left without any clear notion as to what was being said through the film and why.,Fresh
"In this interview, The Lucky Ones director Neil Burger speaks about understanding the modern soldier, his surprising casting choice of anti-war activist Tim Robbins as a veteran and why he relates the story while the Iraq conflict continues.",Rotten
"It feels like the writers were trying for dialogue that sounded natural and improvisational. Instead, it feels scripted and rehearsed. It's all phony balony!",Rotten
"If not for the warmth and likability of its characters and those playing them, The Lucky Ones would be a tiresome formula picture.",Fresh
... captures the manner in which both the smallest and largest events on a road trip can build a sense of camaraderie among three strangers with very little in common.,Fresh
"Their real, unstated missions are more in the nature of relocating their souls and finding some elusive peace of mind.",Fresh
"Mostly everything in the film, regardless of how contrived the set up, eventually rings true.",Fresh
A cautious but strained apolitical Iraqi War drama.,Rotten
It feels like it secretly wants to be a Iraq vet version [ of Y tu Mama Tambien] but is afraid to go there.,Rotten
Predictable sitcom but delightfully feel-goodish.,Fresh
"Enjoyable, sharply written and frequently hilarious comedy with strong comic performances from its cast. This should strike a chord with slightly overweight men everywhere.",Fresh
Pegg exudes his usual air of faint self-congratulation playing an unlikeable prat whom nobody in their right mind would prefer to the high- flying Azariah or indeed to anyone.,Rotten
"An enjoyable if patchy and predictable ride, but Simon Pegg shows he's more than capable of going the distance.",Fresh
"You'll laugh a bit, but not much, while your interest in the storyline will hover between mild interest and vague indifference. Needless to say, all memories of this movie will evaporate on contact with daylight.",Rotten
Schwimmer often resists an easy laugh in favour of a poignant moment and thereby heightens the sense of urgency during Dennis' last dash for glory.,Fresh
Pegg proves agreeable company in a lightweight Britcom whose biggest laughs emanate from its supporting cast.,Fresh
"When Schwimmer managed to get Pegg on board, his good fortune became ours.",Fresh
Friends star David Schwimmer proves that nothing wins over a crowd like a barking underdog and bags of below-the-belt humour - his directing debut is a wheeze.,Fresh
"What should be dreadfully synthetic actually plays as a pleasant time-passer, thanks to a goodly supply of one-liners, and Pegg and Newton's facility for investing a string of hokey plot devices with genuine warmth. Formulaic, yet disarmingly enjoyable.",Fresh
"Pegg pitched Shaun of the Dead as ""Richard Curtis shot through the head."" Run, Fat Boy, Run comes on more like ""Richard Curtis kicked in the nuts"" - a refreshingly honest Britcom that never really threatens the ribs but which is amiable company throughout",Fresh
"...excessive product-placement has turned the film into one enormous ad for Nike, with all the chilling humourlessness that this implies.",Rotten
...despite lacking marquee stars could do well with the date-night mainstream.,Fresh
"There are no surprises here -- just broad, frequently slapstick gags that don't avoid but do tamp down a bit on the bodily-function school of yokkery.",Rotten
Predictable and conventionally anti-American.,Rotten
...a mess of sentimental cliches...,Rotten
Seems to lack the aspirations necessary to overcome its failings.,Rotten
"It is an immensely likable, big-hearted romantic comedy that has a wide-ranging appeal as unpretentious feel-good escapism and a perfect date movie choice.",Fresh
Formulaic and thoroughly conventional.,Rotten
"It's not hysterically funny, but this British comedy is sharp enough to keep us chuckling right to the predictably sappy conclusion.",Fresh
"Run, Fatboy, Run is the type of romantic comedy apt to be described as ""nice"" or ""sweet,"" both of which are codewords for ""unexceptional"" and ""useless.""",Rotten
"Run, Fat Boy, Run shows that Simon Pegg can't rescue a derivative dud.",Rotten
"Simon Pegg's considerable skills can only do so much to enliven the mediocre text of actor David Schwimmer's feature directing debut, a mildy humorous trifle with some heart but not enough hilarity.",Rotten
It's as if [director David] Schwimmer managed to shoot himself in his foot with the starter's pistol.,Rotten
Schwimmer and Pegg have scored a win--largely due to tasteful choices in the subplotting and providing such a rich ensemble to tickle the shenanigans to a higher level.,Fresh
"Although I did enjoy the incongruity of the characters, this well-intentioned low brow co-production does not quite make it to the finish line.",Rotten
"Schwimmer just doesn't have the directorial wit to elevate the intermittently amusing script, and none of the cast seems dedicated enough to raise the bar either.",Rotten
"Pacing and suspension of disbelief aside, I had fun with the heart-felt moments and the sheer comedy. Plus, it√¢(TM)s great to see Pegg jump out of his Edgar Wright-zone for a bit and try making a movie with a different group for a change.",Fresh
"Credit Pegg for inserting his smart brand of character-driven humor everywhere the script needed him (he polished up an old script by Michael Ian Black), and credit Schwimmer for keeping things moving quickly and efficiently.",Fresh
An unapologetic throwback to the days when comedies didn't have to be all that original -- just as long as they were funny.,Fresh
"Using conventional slapstick gags and inventive crosscutting, David Schwimmer scores as a creditable, if not memorable, director...but the innocuous script is totally predictable.",Rotten
This is an amiable film that will provoke some chuckles.,Fresh
"Run, Fat Boy, Run stays out of sitcom quicksand long enough to make you think that Schwimmer has a knack for this comedy-directing thing.",Fresh
"""Run, Fat Boy, Run"" is a cut-and-dried formula comedy slightly elevated by its more than competent cast.",Rotten
"Well enough crafted to keep you in stitches while on the edge of your seat for the duration, even if this laff-a-minute escape is more mindless than cerebral.",Fresh
"I wouldn't believe that Run Fat Boy Run was co-written by Simon Pegg if he weren't up there on the screen in teeny briefs and with his gut stuck out, trying to endear himself to the American audience in material maybe a notch above Rob Schneider's.",Rotten
Pegg has staked out a peculiar slant on genre material that ventures beyond irony toward rehabilitation -- and nobody plays blithe humiliation with more style.,Fresh
"Pegg is brilliant, pratfalling his way through heartbreak and indignity",Fresh
This is yet another parody that falls victim to the desire to become what it's intending to satirize.,Rotten
A thin premise undermined by rampant stupidity at every turn.,Rotten
Predictable losers-are-people-too jesting raised a notch by the quality work of consummate professionals.,Rotten
"Director David Schwimmer bloats this slapdash concept into dim, witless overkill.",Rotten
"Brit romcom mixes laughs with swearing, smoking.",Fresh
[Star/writer Pegg] ladles a deeper understanding of why men screw up into Dennis than we usually see in romantic comedies...,Fresh
"It has meaning and sentiment and a nice pay-off for its finale. But without more laughs, Run Fatboy Run is awfully winded by the time it crosses the finish line.",Fresh
"The presence of Simon Pegg and Dylan Moran elevates what might have been merely a pleasant, harmless but ultimately forgettable romantic comedy.",Fresh
"Clumsy and inept in demeanor but a whirlwind of comic energy, with an air of self-congratulatory winsomeness, Simon Pegg steals this otherwise minor but enjoyably unpretentious little comedy and pockets it like a Mars bar.",Fresh
Run Fat Boy Run wouldn't make it to the finish line without Simon Pegg's winning performance.,Fresh
It runs out of steam - and you'll likely run out of interest - long before the finish line.,Rotten
Don't get me wrong. The film is seldom boring and I certainly never hated sitting in my seat taking it all in.,Rotten
"Outside of a couple of moments of self-conscious shock humor, the most surprising thing about the film is how square it really is.",Rotten
Simon Pegg is almost brilliant with his slapstick comedy and dedication to goofiness.,Fresh
"This brand of unfailing comic timing and expressive physicality is rare, and it's why Pegg, in particular, is a star. [Blu-ray]",Fresh
ends up feeling like a boring limerick told over and over again.,Rotten
"Schwimmer is wise to keep his camera trained on Pegg at all times, as the actor can make any sequence worthwhile with his unexpected, jittery retorts and reactions.",Fresh
"Fatboy may be more welcome than the latest Matthew McConaughey-Kate Hudson vehicle, but only by a nose.",Rotten
"While [Pegg] gets some mileage out of this sketchy material, he's undermined by story and character problems, as well as the limp, uninspired direction of actor-turned-filmmaker David Schwimmer.",Rotten
It looks like British writers Simon Pegg and Michael Ian Black have been studying the romantic comedies of Adam Sandler.,Rotten
"... lacks the invention of [Simon] Pegg's comedies with Edgar Wright, which buzz and crackle with ideas and energy. This one simply plods through...",Rotten
"Run Fatboy Run isn't particularly hilarious or moving, but it's got just enough humor and pathos to render its myriad flaws almost forgivable. Almost.",Rotten
Could a better combination of collaborators have produced something greater? Definitely. But this cheerful mix of juvenility and grown-up-relationship angst goes down smoothly enough to be worth watching.,Fresh
"Run Fat Boy Run is hard to love, thanks to the tedious romantic-comedy cliches to which it subjects its characters -- and us.",Rotten
"The project represents an uncertain Britification of a script by Chicago native Michael Ian Black, and the result finds itself stranded somewhere out in the Atlantic, mid-crossing.",Rotten
So pathetically average that you can barely muster the energy to have an opinion about it.,Rotten
Snarkiness and sentiment are in constant battle for supremacy throughout Run Fat Boy Run with no chance of a comfortable draw.,Rotten
"[Director] Schwimmer shows some skill by keeping the mood light and making no notable missteps, but he still comes away looking like someone trying, and failing, to play Judd Apatow, the reigning champion of realistic, emotional comedy.",Rotten
[Director] David Schwimmer takes the sow's ear of a script given him by [Simon] Pegg and Michael Ian Black and deep-fries it into a burnt pork rind of a movie.,Rotten
"There are so many scenes of him running, it's surprising Pegg didn't just take off and never come back to the set after he saw how things were going.",Rotten
"Anyone hoping for the lean meat of the fast, furious, and riotously funny Shaun of the Dead or even the popcorn fancy of the lesser Hot Fuzz will do best to look elsewhere.",Rotten
"It may be the kind of film that will make you smile more than laugh, but you'll smile a lot. And although it practically forces you to root for its hero, you won't mind a bit because the hero is played by Simon Pegg.",Fresh
"Depends on the charm of its leading man. But that proves a commodity which, in Pegg's case, proves to be not only in short supply but positively out of stock.",Rotten
"Pegg's Dennis is lazy, insensitive and unhygienic. Yet his most defining quality is blandness. I could barely rouse myself to dislike him.",Rotten
"Although you can see the finish line from the starting shot, Pegg elevates the movie from eye-rolling to forgivably genial with his ace delivery and genuinely entertaining pratfalls.",Fresh
"It ambles along pleasantly, produces a few chuckles, and is forgotten by the time you pass the popcorn counter on the way out of the theater.",Rotten
I wish the script credited to Michael Ian Black (The Pleasure of Your Company) and (Simon) Pegg had a little more intrigue along the way to its predictable finish.,Rotten
"A hackneyed slacker scenario reduces this film from an entertainment marathon to a plot treading water. The feel-good message comes around, but there is too much packaging for the product.",Rotten
"[The movie] may not [provide] an onslaught of gut-busting laughs, but the humor that does come forth is heartier and more authentic.",Fresh
"For his debut directing role, Schwimmers steers a safe ""PG-13"" date movie that roots for the underdog and has a good overall message.",Fresh
"It would have been funnier if, instead of Pegg, his frequent collaborator, Nick Frost had taken the role. Then we would have a film worthy of its name. And maybe even a few more genuine guffaws.",Rotten
"One thing Schwimmer does do right is keep the story moving swiftly. You're in, you're out, no harm done -- unless you want that hour and a half back.",Rotten
"Amiable, consistently amusing and surprisingly affecting, it has the flavor of a Nick Hornby novel, with its focus on an overgrown boy struggling to grow up and be a man.",Fresh
"Run, Fat Boy, Run is the directorial debut of actor David Schwimmer, who is much better behind the camera than in front of it. Here, he's taken material best suited to sketch comedy and turned it into a feature of no small heart and humour.",Fresh
"Run Fatboy Run is largely content to follow the formula, guide us on a sunny tour of downtown London's tourist hot spots and transform Pegg from paunchy schlub to Runderella with a few decent laughs along the way.",Fresh
"Tere's nothing edgy or new about Run, Fat Boy, Run.",Rotten
"This is a romantic comedy light on romance but heavy on comedy, and it's well cast to skew in that direction.",Fresh
"The sort of flat-footed studio film that takes the basic ingredients of an underground hit, drains them of personality and style, and spits them out as a situation comedy.",Rotten
The humor tends toward the mildly crass -- bare buttocks and inappropriate scratching are Schwimmer's go-to comedy staples -- and the story is ridiculous.,Rotten
"Enough already. I mean, I don't have anything against comedies about dopey guys who win the love of a good woman by competing in ridiculous Olympian contests. But if I wanted to see a really funny one, I'd rent a Rocky movie.",Rotten
"The kind of movie that's apt to be dismissed a goofy lark. It is that. But it's also a rare comedy that believes in its own message, and that could inspire the depressed and the demoralized to grit their teeth and keep running.",Fresh
"Thanks to a jaunty Brit-rock score and likable characters all around, the movie's easy to watch and occasionally pumps up the emotions.",Fresh
"There's much too much of everything in Run, Fatboy, Run. Every ounce of comedy is so forced and full-on ridiculous that when characters express even a smidgen of sentiment, it feels like a parody.",Rotten
"Pleasant but unfocused, a romantic farce, trying very hard to be sweet when it needs to be a bit more cheeky.",Rotten
"The material isn't any more inspired than the protagonist is inspiring. Run, Fat Boy, Run should have been whipped into better shape before the starting gun sounded.",Rotten
"While this movie lacks the screaming energy and consistency of Shaun of the Dead and his hysterical Hot Fuzz, Pegg is able to keep things interesting.",Fresh
"A movie that is smartly written, boasts plenty of funny lines and rides hard on Pegg's ability to look and act like the most stoically put-upon person on the planet.",Fresh
"This is not a film with blazingly original ideas or a groundbreaking script - I guessed the ending before the movie even started - but it has a sweet nature, an abundance of laughs and plenty of Pegg to spare.",Fresh
"From storyline to characterization to style of comedy, everything about the directorial debut of former Friends star David Schwimmer is a nod to accommodation, compromise and consensus.",Rotten
Thin-on-laughs Fatboy stumbles more than sprints.,Rotten
"There's a cheeky, cross-continental exuberance to Run, Fatboy, Run that lifts it over its predictability and keeps you laughing louder than you know you should. It's an upfront guilty pleasure without pretense; what a pleasant surprise.",Fresh
"Run, Fatboy, Run isn't going to win any prizes for fresh questions. But it's just fleet enough to hold its own in the middle of the pack.",Fresh
"Run Fat Boy Run might as well have been written by a rushed piece of software. The program calls for a surprise engagement, a street fight complete with crotch punches, an apartment eviction, and a runaway child -- all in about five minutes.",Rotten
"Deserves credit for not working us over the way so many modern comedies too. It brings us to the finish line with energy to spare, instead of leaving us feeling sapped.",Fresh
"For all its faults however, this is a romantic comedy that works - if just barely.",Rotten
"A near-miss, a film with some funny scenes that will probably work significantly better on DVD, but, ultimately, it quite simply doesn't have enough laughs to elevate it to greatness.",Rotten
"An overlong over-conventional under-funny romantic comedy. To put it in its own terms, it might make it as a 100-yard-dash, but does not have the stamina for a marathon.",Rotten
"Amiable. Bland. Cute. Formulaic. Inconsequential. Run Fatboy Run goes down with ease, but it's awfully slight.",Rotten
"Seldom laugh-out-loud funny and the script doesn't have the witty insight of Pegg's last few films, but Pegg's bumbling charm is just enough to make this movie run.",Fresh
"Pacing is brisk, the laughs frequent. With an ending corny and Capra-esque, 'Run, Fat Boy, Run' charms right to the finish line.",Fresh
It's clear in the scene where they try to scam the marathon officials that Dylan Moran would be a good candidate to play the grown Harry Potter in the Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows film. Somebody take note!,Fresh
"Simon Pegg is a wonderful physical comedian. And he's able to take off with his talent in ""Run Fatboy Run,"" a comedy that's not up to par of his other starring roles but one that nonetheless provides quite a few laughs.",Fresh
"While some moments rely solely on Pegg's natural on-screen goofiness, he & M. I. Black have simply written a very funny script that spreads the fun evenly throughout.",Fresh
Schwimmer's sliced cheese mediocrity gets him off the hook; not so for the usually inventive Pegg and Black and their arms race of bland jokes and cheap male nudity,Rotten
"When all is said and done, you're better off renting the Friends Season Four finale...That was brilliant. This is like a bad Farrelly Brothers movie.",Rotten
"The jokes land softly, but Run Fatboy Run moves at a sitcom-like clip that keeps it watchable even when it isn't especially funny.",Rotten
"Sure it's predictable. Sure it's a slight effort, but I still think it's pretty funny and charming.",Fresh
"Overcomes its occasional stumbles, thanks almost entirely to the charm of its cast...",Fresh
"Simon Pegg has a great face! Not since Jerry Lewis has anyone been able to look pathetic, adorable and stupid, all at the same time.",Fresh
Give me this type of writing any day over some of the inane scripts that plague a Will Ferrell or Adam Sandler flick. Simon Pegg can hold his own with any comic working today.,Fresh
A fine work of craftspeople both in front of the camera and behind...whose chief mistake is that every one of them appears to have forgotten that it was in fact a comedy.,Rotten
"A fry-up of American, British and Irish comedy sensibilities that will have no trouble satisfying mainstream movie appetites.",Fresh
"Neither original nor packed with surprises. It is, however, entertaining and thoroughly likable.",Fresh
"Simon Pegg gives it the old college try, but his character isn't worthy our cheers. Maybe Pegg should resurrect his most famous character, the resourceful, much funnier Shaun, and do battle with the zombies of London rather than the marathon runners of Lo",Rotten
"Certainly not the worst movie of the year, not in a year that brought us Over Her Dead Body, One Missed Call, Fool's Gold, Snow Angels and Mad Money. It could be the most mediocre though.",Rotten
"Predictable and clich√©d as Run Fatboy Run is, it is an entertaining romedy that, unfortunately, doesn't have much staying power after credits roll.",Fresh
"...a bit rude and uncouth, but sweetly affecting...",Fresh
Warm/funny film about a man trying to re-win his true love by running a race,Fresh
"It is neither as funny nor as wickedly subversive as 'Shaun of the Dead,' but it respects its characters enough to make them thoughtful and surprisingly complex, unlike the sitcom stereotypes inhabiting lesser romantic comedies.",Fresh
It's a lazy effort that offers little encouragement for the future of Schwimmer's directorial career.,Rotten

Schwimmer offers generic rom-com conventions in his feature directorial debut.,Rotten
It's a good formalic romantic comedy. Nothing more.,Fresh
It's a Generation X movie in a way very few movies are any more; it is unseemly to admit that our generation is about as slackery as we had promised to become. Go with your ex and smile.,Fresh

The picture manages to juggle both the silly and the sentimental without falling flat.,Fresh
"The film, like its flabby aspiring marathon runner protagonist, feels shapeless and exhausted from the sheer effort of trying to please audiences.",Fresh
This feeble premise limits the movie to perfunctory gags about the hero's sloth and some canned underdog drama.,Rotten
"Far from the gut-busting brilliance of Pegg's other, self-made starring vehicles.",Rotten
Nothing to be embarrassed about here. Though the kick-in-the-balls scene does run on a bit.,Fresh
"About as funny as Ross on ""Friends."" David Schwimmer (Ross on ""Friends"") directs.",Rotten
Satisfyingly entertaining.,Fresh
"Disappointingly, Run, Fat Boy, Run is an unsatisfying hybrid not funny enough to be a true comedy, and not serious enough for a drama.",Rotten
"The film jogs along uncertain whether it is aiming to be an episode of Friends or a Farrelly brothers farce. Overrun with fart jokes, it is fitfully funny and hamstrung by a sentimental and implausible plot.",Rotten
Much of the comedy left me cold.,Rotten
"An enjoyable, even heartwarming little movie that embraces its clich√©s and never lets them get in the way",Fresh
"Meticulous, detailed, cohesive, comedic, charming, embraceable and entertaining. David Schwimmer has done Mom proud with this one.",Fresh
"Amid the laughs, the one thing Closing Escrow proves is this: It's a lot more fun watching other people trying to buy or sell a house than going through it yourself, particularly if Realtors like the ones here are involved.",Fresh
"There are occasionally mildly trenchant observations made about social status and racism, but overall this fixer-upper has very little curb appeal.",Rotten
"While far from the cream of the mockumentary crop, it's still a pleasant diversion.",Fresh
The film would have worked better if it had stuck more closely to real estate as both the source and target of the satire.,Rotten
"If you can watch it without weeping over your own predicament, you'll see some serious talent bursting out.",Fresh
Closing Escrow is one of those self-aware mockumentaries of the sort Christopher Guest likes to make -- only it's not that funny.,Rotten
"No matter how ridiculous the characters come off, they're more than just punch lines. In fact, despite their quirks, [they're] improbably endearing.",Fresh
"Limited to three couples and their real estate agents and a handful of property locations, this indie never ceases to entertain.",Fresh
"A spoof, sometimes a funny one, and sometimes just plain overkill.",Rotten
Escrow isn't as polished or consistent as the best of its sub-genre -- but it's pretty dang funny for the most part.,Fresh
"A sometimes laugh-out-loud send-up of homebuyers' worst instincts, the extreme behavior of real-estate agents and what happens when the certifiably insane save enough for a down payment.",Fresh
"... more or less in the Christopher Guest vein, but with nowhere near as many laughs.",Rotten
"The obviously improvised proceedings -- at least let's hope they're improvised -- fail to produce the desired laughs, with frequent pauses after punch lines that will only result in lengthy silences.",Rotten
The film's been sitting on the shelf for 2 1/2 years; maybe it went bad?,Rotten
The funniest Antarctic thriller of 2009!!!,Rotten
"like keeping a refrigerator door open, [director Dominic Sena] lets out all the fear and suspense.",Rotten
Perhaps it would have been better if I'd blacked out for most of Whiteout.,Rotten
".Little more than an extended episode of ""C.S.I. Antarctica,"" ""Whiteout"" is a film that couldn't be more boring and uninteresting if it tried and if there is one thing that it most certainly doesn't do, it is try.",Rotten
"When serious moments are accompanied again and again by collective widespread laughter from an otherwise well-behaved audience, it is a tell-tale sign that something has gone very wrong in translation from page to screen.",Rotten
We do wish you the best in your future endeavors and that you do manage to find a warmer climate.,Rotten
It is a mystery why star Beckinsale...keeps wallowing in junk food genre fare....a might more entertaining than watching snow on your television.,Rotten
...feels like one of those movies that never progressed much beyond the concept stage - yet ended up getting released anyway.,Rotten
Beckinsale gives a standout performance as the smart and tough female protagonist. You root for her to prevail over the bad guys.,Fresh
"It's a wonder Whiteout isn't in 3D, what with its initial onslaught of in-your-face flying propellers, crashing planes, and a lingering close-up of Kate Beckinsale stripping to her skivvies.",Rotten
The screenplay by Jon and Erich Hoeber and Chad and Carey Hayes (too many cooks?) is confusing and leaps huge gaps in logic.,Rotten
"Sadly, Whiteout wimps out, starting out like The Thing and winding up like CSI: South Pole, wasting whatever it has going for it.",Rotten
"One must assume that Rucka's original [graphic novel] is better than this, but only because most things are.",Rotten
"The mystery is not mysterious, the action is not exciting, and the suspense is more like boredom.",Rotten
"Oh, the squandering! It's like setting a story on Mars and then pretending we're just out in the Arizona desert.",Rotten
"Absurdities are to be expected in ""genre"" filmmaking, but disbelief can only be suspended so far.",Rotten
It'll take all day to list all the things that are wrong with Whiteout.,Rotten
"Whiteout is a conventionally jam-packed, dutifully ludicrous action thriller.",Rotten
"Whiteout's intriguing setting and storyline would be gripping if Beckinsale's Sherlocking around wasn't so glossed-over, or alternately spoon-fed to the audience.",Rotten
Stupefying journey to the bottom of the earth.,Rotten
"If you want the real Whiteout experience, just read the book. Or ask the manager of your local 7-Eleven if you can play Clue in the beer cooler.",Rotten
"All we're given is a lukewarm mystery where frustrating plot holes give way to lackulster conclusions, and even the most furious CGI snowstorms can't obscure the film's telegraphed ""twist.""",Rotten
"Dull and draining, Whiteout should have been offered under one of these preferable alternate titles -- Washout, or even better, Wornout.",Rotten
"A dreadful sleeping pill, marching into production with the best intentions in the world, but coming out the other side a jumbled, incompetent, ludicrously underlined whodunit.",Rotten
An Antarctic-set murder mystery that might have played well on the printed page but emerges as a slushy mess on the screen.,Rotten
The only thing to care about is what lotion Beckinsale uses to make her skin hold up so well in sub-zero temps.,Rotten
"An adequate thriller - complete with scares, red herrings and a nonsensical twist-ending %u2013 which exploits its Antarctic surroundings for all their worth.",Rotten
The mystery grows thick while the ice on which the story elements struggle to survive melts away.,Rotten
"It has a great cast, an original thriller setting, and a compelling concept, and yet the central mystery is surprisingly limp.",Rotten
"But the screenplay is a massive jumble of nonsensical moments and ideas, while director Dominic Sena mishandles things so thoroughly finding the bits where things run smoothly is like finding a needle in a gigantic mountain of powdery snow.",Rotten
"A lifeless whodunit, it wastes the mystical setting and the always game Kate Beckinsale on a pedestrian plot that could be set anywhere.",Rotten
A tolerably entertaining film starring the weather.,Fresh
...an easy enough way to pass time if you're not too demanding or if the cast or unusual setting piques your interest.,Fresh
"It's as bad as ""I Know What You Did Last Summer"", except on ICE!",Rotten
Ice-schlocky - an idiotic wipeout.,Rotten
"For all its frozen blood, assaults with ice axes and killer weather, Whiteout turns out to be only a pale imitation of the thriller it might have been.",Rotten
The severely nonthrilling thriller Whiteout moves like winter in Antarctica. Who the flake greenlit this blobby blur?,Rotten
"While the setting can be mesmerizing, little else about this movie is captivating. It's a standard-issue thriller, with a twist you see coming a continent away.",Rotten
"No event occurs without a character telling us what we're seeing. This unwelcome commentary is so overdone that it becomes, by the end, an invitation for audience participation. All together now: It's a body! Looks like it's been shot in the head!",Rotten
Whiteout offers nothing to satisfy fans of the comic and nothing to satisfy even the casual filmgoer just looking for diversion or escape from the heat.,Rotten
"Whiteout conditions don't translate well to the action genre, either. Unless you don't mind watching unidentifiable snow-suited folks grapple in -50C conditions with an also-unidentifiable icepick-wielding murderer as CG ice violently pelts down on them.",Rotten
Parental Content Review,Rotten
"The most surprising thrill ride of the summer, in that it is adequately thrilling and I didn't expect that.",Fresh
"The film is all panicky zooms and badly staged action dotted with random forensic gross-outs. And, just for the fun of it, an amputation scene.",Rotten
"The script for Whiteout is shockingly boring, centering around a mystery that wouldn't pass a writer's meeting for CSI: Antarctica.",Rotten
"The movie then becomes one of those murder mysteries where everyone is a suspect, and the murderer himself is the least likely candidate of all. Dispelling all logic, you should be able to figure out this whodunit in the opening minutes.",Rotten
Depicts how a woman U.S. marshal at a frigid station in Antarctica is tested on many levels by a murder case.,Fresh
Its worst offense is assuming the audience is so dumb that it'll be shocked by one of the most telegraphed endings in movie history.,Rotten
A ham-handed murder mystery.,Rotten
Those worried this means Beckinsale will be wearing parkas and snowsuits the entire time will be pleased they still figure a way to showcase her in her underwear within the first 5 minutes,Rotten
"Has a perfunctory, by-the-numbers approach to its story and its characters.",Rotten
"We get an irritated Nancy Drew with a flashlight, stomping about in mukluks through a plot with as much clarity as an ice storm at midnight.",Rotten
"...the whole cast delivers numb, almost affect-less performances; the cold must have got to them.",Rotten
"Even in a whiteout, you can see the plot twists coming.",Rotten
A predictable whodunnit set in a cinematographer's paradise.,Rotten
"John Frizzel's over-worked soundtrack keeps telling us how exciting everything is, but it feels as if we're frozen in time. Not so much a white-out as wipe-out.",Rotten
A frozen hellhole.,Rotten
At least 10% more exciting than correction fluid.,Rotten
There's wonderful potential for permanently bleached out vistas to embody a metaphorical emptiness. Here it's just a great big blank.,Rotten
"A whodunnit set on a scientific research base in Antarctica that slowly becomes a ""Who cares?""",Rotten
"Despite Beckinsale's impeccable features appearing to be rendered in porcelain, her performance is far from lifeless...she does the best with the material. It's just a shame the same can't be said for the film-makers.",Rotten
The sub-standard work from everyone involved means that Whiteout is very much a missed opportunity that undoubtedly would have been better left on the comic book page.,Rotten
"Devoid of personality and full of characters so one-dimensional that they aren't even worth mentioning in this review, Whiteout is a movie that sees no-one emerge with any credit.",Rotten
"What's missing from Whiteout is the pervasive sense of paranoia that you'd expect, or hope for, from a thriller set on the coldest and most isolated land mass on the planet.",Rotten
"Its worst offense is assuming the audience is so dumb that it'll be shocked by one of the most telegraphed endings in movie history. On second thought, maybe the filmmakers got their wish: Whiteout is shocking, shockingly bad.",Rotten
"By eliminating so many suspects before the obligatory drawing-room denouement and final deadly confrontation, it's a given that the audience will feel cheated when the real bad guy turns out to be the only possible contender.",Rotten
Should fade faster than a polar bear in a blizzard.,Rotten
"With plotholes you could drive a snowplough through and as eventful as an Antarctic winter, Whiteout is less a whodunit than a getonwithit.",Rotten
"Set in Antarctica, but unbelievably boring. I kept hoping for something unexpected to show up, like a killer penguin, but it never did.",Rotten
"Hobbled by a ruinously slow start, an utter lack of excitement and a twist ending that everyone will see coming, we're left with one of the year's worst.",Rotten
"The first sight the audience gets of the Brit star is her stripping to her undies, pointing her perfectly-shaped rear to the camera then stepping into the shower. It's one of Whiteout's three highlights.",Rotten
"Apart from a lascivious shot of his scantily clad star, director Dominic Sena keeps the action fairly swift under blizzard-like conditions: at times we seem to be watching people fight inside a snow globe.",Rotten
"The story could be involving but it's clumsily told, veering between simplistic and confusing.",Rotten
"Whiteout has a good premise and a likeable lead, but it goes rapidly downhill and is ultimately disappointing.",Rotten
"This generic snowbound thriller desperately wants to remind you of Insomnia, but it's not worth losing much sleep over.",Rotten
"Lacks sufficient thrills, chills and intrigue as it grows into an increasingly ludicrous and inane mess, even if you're willing to suspend your disbelief for 101 minutes.",Rotten
Characters flail their way through the snow and we squint to see what's going on only to discover that what's going on is pretty much nothing.,Rotten
"The characters based on the [graphic] novel never get beyond one dimension and the film moves at the pace of an Antarctic glacier. On second thought, the glacier moves faster.",Rotten
Setting Whiteout in Antarctica salvages the movie from the cinematic scrap heap.,Fresh
What a stiff.,Rotten
You'd think that a movie that opens with a gratuitous Kate Beckinsale shower scene couldn't be all bad. But you'd be wrong.,Rotten
"At first I thought they were trying to do a film noir thing with the dialogue, but then I realized that it was just bad writing made worse by horrendous line delivery.",Rotten
"Whiteout is not awful, but it is maddeningly mediocre.",Rotten
I'd watch Kate Beckinsale in anything but even she can't make this movie anything better than average.,Rotten
Where are the penguins?,Rotten
A stupid thriller.,Rotten
"The screenplay is unusually lazy -- additional investigators (Gabriel Macht, purportedly a U.N. detective) appear literally out of nowhere, in the middle of nowhere.",Rotten
"Starting from a graphic novel, Sena has turned out your standard TV crime show bloated with a monstrous FX budget.",Rotten
Is best when dealing with the splendors of the natural landscape.,Rotten
"It takes slightly longer than three minutes for diminished mental capacity to set in during this Antarctic murder mystery with a fatally low body temperature. Kate Beckinsale is unrepentantly lazy, dialogue is awful and its misdirection is obvious.",Rotten
It's pretty poor.,Rotten
"Kate Beckinsale, adrift in a blizzard of cliches, doesn't have enough star presence or her Stevie Nicks black leather vampire drag to keep audiences from drifting away. Bland and predictable.",Rotten
"The misleading trailer suggests 'Nancy Drew vs. the Thing,' but this graphic-novel adaptation is more 'CSI: Antractica' -- a straight if occasionally gruesome murder mystery, boosted by the novelty of its sub-zero South Pole setting.",Rotten
It's Kate Beckinsale on Ice.,Rotten
The film's slick and expensive looking but dumber than a dead penguin.,Rotten
"a relatively mediocre, by-the-numbers mystery thriller that melts from your mind as soon as you step into the sunlight",Rotten
"I wasn't entertained, I just wanted out of the supposed cold.",Rotten
...just predictable routine.,Rotten
The movie is as inert as the wintry terrain in which it is set.,Rotten
"The film's biggest crime is that no obvious effort was made here, everything flows with the rigidity of a check list of genre cliches and safe choices.",Rotten
Whiteout is a colorless wasteland. There's only one thing that could have helped cover this film up: A flashback that changed the script's name to Wite-Out.,Rotten
"Needed: Generic thriller in an exotic setting, some gore, possible sci-fi elements, female lead, and an older male star to play grizzled supporting character. Must work cheap.",Rotten
"...it's painless. Brainless, too, but not so much so that you want to throw a shoe at the screen.",Rotten
"Okay, it's far from the best murder mystery you've ever seen, but I still can't help but liking this throwaway thriller. The ending was no surprise. Paul Chambers, CNN.",Fresh
South Pole-set whodunnit is bloody but bland.,Rotten
"If you'd forgotten that this title ever existed, well, so have I.",Rotten
"Dominic Sena, whose credits include 1993's 'Kalifornia' (good) and 1996's 'Swordfish' (not so good), can't seem to find anything new under the perpetually obscured sun.",Rotten
Whiteout isn't particularly bad but it does follow the thriller playbook step-by-step with only a little tweaking. A lack of originality isn't the end of the world but it could have been so much better.,Fresh
"When the snow starts blowing, it's impossible to tell who's who and what's what. Maybe parkas should be color-coded.",Rotten
Gallons of the titular correction fluid may have helped Dominic Sena's abysmal thriller if it had been applied at just about any juncture during the graphic novel-to-feature film script stage.,Rotten
"It's a shame to see Beckinsale reduced to this, with the camera leering over her body as she showers in a sleazily transparent (and altogether useless) exploitation of her sexuality.",Rotten
Whiteout looks stunning but underneath that icy sheen it's an utter damp squib of a film.,Rotten
Beckinsale tries to make something happen here.,Rotten
It's a film brimming with individual scenes featuring nice visual touches about the South and comforting down-home dialogue spiced with a healthy twinge of sarcasm. Too bad the movie never completely gels.,Rotten
Slow-cooked to perfection,Fresh
"The influences of a strange outside world rub up against -- and sometimes abrade -- Southern tradition and a good ol' boy's increasingly fragile sense of self in this dry, gentle, sometimes silly and sometimes very funny comedy.",Fresh
"...the sort of movie that, if the dice fall right, could find a considerable audience. It is a lot smarter and truer to life than a lot of little independent movies that could and did.",Fresh
"It's just that the comedy and the drama never quite crystalize into anything remotely affecting, with the end result feeling more like some extended Southern in-joke than an honest movie.",Rotten
"Arch in a way that his previous feature was honest, it's a clumsy attempt to lay an overcoat of forced cornpone whimsy on a drab storyline involving mobsters.",Rotten
A Southern-fried deadpan farce that suggests a mid-'60s CBS sitcom as reimagined by Hal Hartley.,Fresh
"Not a very good movie, on the whole, but there are laugh-out-loud moments and there's promise in the unusual world it depicts.",Rotten
"Filmmaker-actor Ray McKinnon voices his Southern droll in this amusing, feel-good comedy.",Fresh
The blarney isn't the only thing that's thick in writer-director Brad Gann's Black Irish.,Rotten
"Writer-director-producer Brad Gann's tale of growing up in blue-collar South Boston features a strong central performance, but it doesn't miss a cliche of hardscrabble adolescence.",Rotten
The difficulties of coming-of-age in an Irish-American family with a violent older brother and a self-destructive father.,Fresh
"A drismal drama rather reminiscent of Angela's Ashes, especially in terms of maintaining a relentlessly pessimistic and morose tone.",Rotten
It'll be worth watching to see if [director Brad Gann] plays to his strengths on future projects.,Rotten
"The problem with Black Irish is that, like those photos shifted to cover the holes, not everything is hanging in quite the right place here.",Rotten
Gleeson inhabits the character in such a way that one cannot help but wonder how many Irish fathers like this he has personally known.,Fresh
"It's too sincere and thoughtful to be immediately dismissed. But it is terribly frustrating viewing: so much time and creative energy spent making a movie that, in one form or another, the audience has already seen.",Rotten
Black Irish boasts many memorable scenes and fine characterizations but ultimately plays more like a series of snapshots come to life than as an organically satisfying story.,Rotten
A small-bore Southie coming-of-age drama whose heart is just a bit bigger than its cliches.,Fresh
"Could almost be labeled a Gaelic minstrel show, so riddled is it with every conceivable clich and stereotype ever associated with the sons of Eire.",Rotten
While the film has many well-observed moments...it ultimately suffers from its relentless piling on of crises.,Rotten
"The movie falls apart when it tries to explain why Poppy's been sent to this school. And the Spartacus moment at her school ""trial"" for misconduct is so cringe-worthy you want to die.",Fresh
"Bright and silly, with just enough wit and intelligence to make it watchable, this British-American teen comedy doesn't break much new ground, but is pretty entertaining while it lasts.",Fresh
"Despite a shaky start, Wild Child is actually a surprisingly entertaining teen flick, thanks to likeable performances and a script that highlights the importance of friendship. Worth seeing.",Fresh
"It may be manna for teen girls but any kind of critical eye will find it about as convincingly made as the last St Trinian's movie. It is played, though, with lively abandon.",Rotten
"Alex Pettyfer is even more wooden than he was in Stormbreaker - for heaven's sake, he's not even that good-looking. And the story's utter tosh.",Rotten
"On balance, gouging one's eyeballs with a chopstick would be more fun than watching this crummy tween comedy about a Californian princess.",Rotten
"The types are such extremes that the partisans in the audience will continue to hate American brats and English snobs respectively, rapprochement between two sets of caricatures seeming unlikely.",Rotten
"WILD? More like mild, unless you think short skirts and ""horse face"" put-downs are outrageous.",Rotten
Shame on Iggy Pop for letting them (ab)use his anarchy-anthem 'Real Wild Child' in a girls'-own flick that is so paltry it makes the recent St Trinians addition look like Picnic At Hanging Rock.,Rotten
"Unless you're fourteen and female, look away now. There's absolutely nothing for you here.",Rotten
"A tweenie comedy with an uplifting American-style sports movie awkwardly bolted on, it's a mess - far inferior to the recent Angus, Thongs and Perfect Snogging.",Rotten
"All amiable enough, but still a bit tame compared to, say, Clueless, or Lindsay Lohan's Freaky Friday remake.",Rotten
It's Mean Girls meets Malory Towers and as such it's strictly for a tween girl audience.,Rotten
"The sort of film that real too-cool-for-school teens wouldn't be seen dead watching, Wild Child is aimed at those younger than its protagonists. Loud and obnoxious, like its lead character, it deserves to be expelled.",Rotten
This celebration of mid-Atlantic compromise is one for the youngest and most forgiving of teenage girls.,Rotten
Clumsy direction means most jokes fall flatter than the paper-thin plot.,Rotten
"The film has an energy and honesty about it: it's lively, funny and smart and the characters are appealing",Fresh
What begins as tedious teen comedy/drama about a Californian brat turns out to be a surprisingly agreeable popcorn flick.,Fresh
"The screenplay by Lucy Dahl (daughter of Roald) dwells unpleasantly on cruelty and humiliation, and finally Poppy does little more than exchange one form of snobbery for another.",Rotten
"It's an unoriginal story but one with potential, and the actors who play Poppy's school chums are lively company.",Fresh
"A project broad-based enough to make tween competitor Angus, Thongs And Perfect Snogging feel arthouse.",Rotten
Competent if mechanical helming debut by editor Nick Moore.,Fresh
Mildly entertaining and utterly innocuous...,Fresh
"A slight but tart teen comedy, Child carries some surprising bite, subverting the norm with a fine British cast helping to sell the pixy stick fantasy, buttressed by Roberts's refreshing angry streak.",Fresh
Surely school should be more fun than this.,Rotten
"Holding up well, cute -- ""peak"" Emma Roberts.",Fresh
A movie full of egregiously overdramatic stupidities.,Rotten
Few will remember Powder Blue as a desperate copy job of Paul Thomas Anderson's brilliant Magnolia but rather as the film where Jessica Biel finally took it all off.,Rotten
"It's not likely [Biel] is comfortable with her nude scenes (which are neither lengthy nor discreet) being used as a selling point, but Bui fails to provide much else worth discussing.",Rotten
an embarrassing display of directorial exploitation and a waste of acting goodwill.,Rotten
"Another Los Angeles-set multistrand drama ""Crash""-es and burns.",Rotten
They seem to be real and they are certainly spectacular--too bad that one can't say the same for the film featuring them.,Rotten
"A serendipitous erotic thriller reminiscent of Crash in the way that lots of Angelenos' lives intersect serendipitously, except that here the characters have a seedy strip club in common instead of car accidents.",Fresh
Patrick Swayze's final feature film role as Wild Velvet strip club boss Velvet Larry is a flamboyant extravaganza,Fresh
This is as much a thoughtful meditation on the plight of the American farmer as it is a rant against our expanding waistlines.,Fresh
A deceptively intelligent new entry in the regular-Joe documentary genre.,Fresh
"An entertaining look at the flagship of American empty calories, King Corn is a few bushels short of being the next Super-Size Me, but brings a legitimate message.",Fresh
"Well, it's certainly one of the less blatantly compelling subjects on the non-fiction circuit, and the doc has a lower-octane approach than most, but King Corn is surprisingly absorbing and amusing viewing.",Fresh
"Sometimes obvious, but at other times quite startling.",Fresh
Aaron Woolf's we-are-what-we-eat documentary King Corn is a lively introduction to the corn industrial complex.,Fresh
"It should be required viewing before going into a supermarket, McDonald's or your very own refrigerator.",Fresh
King Corn insists that we recognize the Corn Belt's beauty and intelligence along with its somewhat self-induced plight.,Fresh
Deftly balances humor and insight.,Fresh
"King Corn is entertaining enough, but it's also a moral, crucially skeptical road trip down the food chain.",Fresh
"Absorbing...it's a lot of science and perspective to cover, yet Woolf manages to keep King Corn focused and sedate.",Fresh
King Corn becomes an indispensable supplement to Spurlock's Super Size Me.,Fresh
"While there's no startling news here -- most people know that high-fructose corn syrup (HFCS) is a staple in food processing and isn't particularly good for us -- this documentary neatly, and often humorously, summarizes a very unhealthy situation.",Fresh
"entertaining and even a little mischievous, it finds perverse outcomes, but no villains. It is informative, without creating partisanship, respectful without being patronizing, entertaining without being dumbed-down",Fresh
"A breezy diary from a pair of first-time farmers, as well as a wry rebuke to a nation devoted to eating cheaply but not necessarily well, King Corn makes its points without much finger-wagging.",Fresh
"The film always teaches and entertains in equal, ample measure. It's a treat -- and it's good for you.",Fresh
Engaging and illuminating.,Fresh
"Simultaneously nostalgic and sinister, King Corn mixes full-blown Americana with fast-food follies in the Iowa heartland.",Fresh
There is an interesting story here. It's just that the movie doesn't tell it very well.,Rotten
Someone pass the Fritos!,Fresh
"We learn a few things from the two daffy guys about food, nutrition, agribusiness, and government support of the latter.",Fresh
"Although the film is very much in the Morgan Spurlock-school of highly personalized documentary filmmaking, King Corn contains a considerable amount of information about how the American farming tradition has changed in the last 50 years.",Fresh
"This smart, amiable documentary is about corn: how it's grown, subsidized, processed, and how it sneaks its way into virtually every food on grocery-store shelves.",Fresh
"Sure to inspire debate in France and Germany and of obvious interest to anyone who follows the roots of modern international terrorism, doc probes gray areas in the colorful life of its controversial, limelight-courting subject.",Fresh
"Schroeder's docu offers a chilly, poignant look at Verges, the controversial lawyer who has defended some of the world's biggest political terrorists and war criminals; it belongs in the same league of his other docus about monsters, like Idi Amin.",Fresh
"Scarcely an expos, Terror's Advocate is more plainly a portrait of a man as a timeline.",Rotten
Engrossing.,Fresh
The title Terror's Advocate is both a statement of fact and a worrisome understatement in a documentary as slippery as its subject.,Fresh
"This fascinating documentary is sort of like a radical left-wing ""Where's Waldo?""",Fresh
"Jacques Vergs had defended a lot of people, and it's his Zelig-like journey through the politics of the postwar 20th century that is the contentious subject of Barbet Schroeder's unwieldy, unforgettable film.",Fresh
That [director] Schroeder doesn't offer simple explanations gives his tale honesty and fascination.,Fresh
"Despite extensive interview footage with Vergs himself, Terror's Advocate fails to crack its enigmatic subject matter.",Rotten
"A brilliantly shrewd and maddeningly elusive figure, controversial lawyer Jacques Vergs alternately fascinates and repulses in Barbet Schroeder's gripping documentary.",Fresh
Talk about a hard sell.,Rotten
"Jacques Vergs is such a compelling, complex and contradictory character that if he didn't exist someone would be obliged to invent him. It is the gift of Terror's Advocate to simply present Vergs as is.",Fresh
"Packed with courtroom drama, mystery and international intrigue.",Fresh
"About halfway through ... the movie's two-hour-+ running time begins to drag, as Shroeder's narrative seems more and more a catalog of events.",Fresh
"Terror's Advocate is one of the most engaging, morally unsettling political thrillers in quite some time, with the extra advantage of being true.",Fresh
Terror's Advocate elucidates the character and defense mechanisms of a man much more complex and radical than the George Bushes of the world.,Fresh
"If nothing else, Terror's Advocate offers a useful summary of the last half-century of global politics, and how changing public perceptions can make goats out of heroes.",Fresh
"An often gripping doc using never-before seen archival films about the self-assured, unrepentant Jacques Verges, who defended some of the most loathsome terrorists and political criminals in modern history.",Fresh
"So loaded with information, the ""fog of war"" morphs into a more enveloping fog of politics and ethics.",Fresh
It's a movie that cries out for a good editor.,Rotten
A brilliant study in the link between moral corruption and narcissism.,Fresh
A panorama of European radicalism.,Fresh
"Jacques Vergs makes for compelling documentary film fodder: He is arrogant, cosmopolitan, politically unpredictable and enmeshed in the roots of modern international terrorism.",Fresh
"Schroeder's film, which combines interviews with many of the key figures in Vergs' career with grainy historical footage, lets its subject speak for itself but leaves little doubt of where the filmmaker stands.",Fresh
"While the man [Vergs] has a snappy aphorism for every question, he remains as imponderable and enigmatic as the Sphinx.",Fresh
"For just a moment, ignore politics. Consider Jacques Vergs simply as star. The radical French lawyer is an absolutely compelling figure onscreen: exotic, resolute, beguilingly smug.",Fresh
The movie functions crackingly well as a non-fiction international thriller.,Fresh
"Barbet Schroeder's astonishing documentary is a glimpse into another world, and not one you would necessarily want to visit for too long.",Fresh
"The lawyer's intense isolation, his solitary, perverse rage against the world, against France, against conventional opinion, is felt most deeply.",Fresh
"If you want to see a who's who in terror, just take a peek at this guy's client list.",Rotten
"[I]ntriguing enough, if a bit dry. But then a flick that seemed newsy, almost wonky, turns riveting...",Fresh
Schroeder's approach to this controversial figure is more plodding than it should be.,Rotten
"If Terror's Advocate doesn't precisely interrogate the rise of terrorism, it does look at its romance and consider its effectiveness.",Fresh
"Though the film comes with a warning that it expresses only the point of view of its director, in reality, what Schroeder seems to offer is a portrait of a glib man who simply defies any conclusive description.",Fresh
"As riveting as it is dizzying, Schroeder's documentary thriller takes a mesmerising ad hominem approach to twentieth century terror, offering up for our judgement an advocate whose views ought to be indefensible.",Fresh
"At its best, the documentary shows us an unsavory character answering a bunch of softball questions and whose best logic is to play the Third World race card.",Fresh
"Ainda que falhe em decifrar seu complexo protagonista, o documentrio estabelece um intrigante retrato de um homem cujos princpios morais e ideolgicos eventualmente se tornam to flexveis quanto o espectro alcanado por sua clientela.",Fresh
This movie is packed with so much glamour and carnage you won't believe it's a documentary about one man.,Fresh
Makes every lawyer joke you've ever heard seem eminently fair.,Fresh
Terror's Advocate is a history lesson in modern insurgency and terrorism paranoia without ever being lecturing at any point. The conceited Verg√®s is always entertaining and clearly loves his own notoriety in this engrossing film.,Fresh
The story Schroeder unfolds is also his own-that of a generation that had its humanistic sympathies manipulated by unscrupulous people with agendas of horror.,Fresh
Braun and his team manage to make this knotty situation lucid and palatable. Darfur Now could conceivably make a difference in enlisting people to the cause.,Fresh
"While its activist subjects are indeed laudable, the film squanders much of its running time on ephemera.",Rotten
Its 99 minutes could have easily been about 65 if you removed all of the celebrity do-gooder filler.,Rotten
"The argument can be made that the subject's urgency excuses the need for artfulness; the opposite, of course, is true.",Rotten
"There are wounding tales of rape and murder, of parents watching their children massacred, in this clear-eyed documentary account of the genocide in Darfur.",Fresh
"Despite honorable intent, docu is too ambitious for its own good, too burdened with celebs, and not insightful enough about its signficant issues.",Fresh
"Frankly, there's a way to get a message across and this sort of talking heads doc by numbers isn't it.",Rotten
"A call to arms of sorts, raising awareness of the land, the people, and the possibility for change, this documentary is not intended to depress, but to ignite passion for all causes great and small.",Fresh
"In a way that news reports so often fail to do, Darfur Now puts a deeply human face on a global crisis.",Fresh
"For all the good intentions on show here, Darfur Now is not much of a film.",Rotten
"[Its] approach is effective at mobilizing audiences to support charitable causes, but it doesn't always translate into compelling viewing. (Feel free to stop reading this now and check out savedarfur.org, darfurgenocide.org, or helpdarfurnow.org).",Fresh
Will more than support the feelings of those already involved and make others think twice before walking past volunteers asking for a minute of their time.,Fresh
An extremely moving and informative documentary.,Fresh
"'Inspiring' is a word often used to describe human-rights-oriented documentaries, but Theodore Braun's film about efforts to ease the ongoing genocide in Sudan's Darfur region really earns that epithet.",Fresh
"Darfur Now is a worthy if inconsistent attempt at collaring a concerned audience and saying, You, too, can make a difference.",Fresh
The best material is the result of the rare opportunity to shoot inside those refugee camps: hearing firsthand testimony from victims about the catastrophic horrors inflicted on their villages is forceful and persuasive.,Fresh
"Much of the film plays like a static lecture, and a repetitive one as well.",Rotten
If you evaluate Darfur Now against the goals it sets for itself -- as a stirring call to action -- it must be considered lacking.,Rotten
"[A]s frustratingly overwhelming as the whole thing may seem, what Braun shows us here is that, yes, ordinary people can do extraordinary things...",Fresh
"Hopefully, well-crafted and moving films such as Darfur Now will inspire more people to take that small but significant first step toward ending these atrocities.",Fresh
"Almost conclusively portrays the Darfur problem as no longer a problem. But even if so, Darfur Now is not really a film about the Darfur problem, anyway.",Fresh
"A quiet, methodical call to action.",Fresh
The documentary Darfur Now proves that -- no matter how important the subject matter -- following various people around with a camera doesn't necessarily make a film.,Rotten
"This is the kind of film that doesn't end after the credits roll, and it's a gold-star example for what a documentary should do: inspire.",Fresh
"Provides context and an invaluable human face to a story that too many Westerners perceive as distant or irrelevant, if they perceive it at all. See Darfur Now, and you won't read the daily news the same way again.",Fresh
"By showing the struggles and efforts of about half a dozen people, it puts a human face on the tragedy.",Fresh
"In movie making, as in life, it's not enough to mean well. The real challenge is in being meaningful.",Rotten
"Both important and engrossing, devastating yet inspiring.",Fresh
"By concentrating on good people dedicated to relieving the crisis, it's almost upbeat.",Fresh
"At 99 minutes, the documentary presents a quick but thorough lesson.",Fresh
"In the end, Darfur Now is a movie whose hopeful message is undermined by its seemingly hopeless reality.",Rotten
This passionate documentary about the African genocide persuasively argues the immediacy of the situation.,Fresh
"It's a brutal mess, and Braun doesn't sugarcoat things.",Fresh
A documentary exploring the roots and reason of African political corruptness and its history of a tribal violence that shows no signs of abating might have done more to raise real outrage.,Rotten
"Nelson Mandela may not have defeated South African apartheid, but his story mobilized worldwide protest, which explains the focus on individuals in this effective advocacy film about the genocide in Darfur.",Fresh
An inspiring documentary about six very different courageous and creative activists who are doing what they can to help the suffering people of Darfur.,Fresh
"If it accomplishes nothing else, Darfur Now locates Sudan on the map -- More than that, the film provides faces for the people of Darfur.",Fresh
"Darfur Now is effective pamphleteering, but only an occasionally compelling documentary film.",Rotten
All the stories are fascinating.,Fresh
"If its explanation of Sudan's politics and history is rudimentary, Darfur Now maintains an effectively intense focus on the necessary work to save actual people in Darfur.",Fresh
"Though well-intentioned, Braun's documentary never captures the emotional heart of this enormous tragedy and fails to ignite the passion he so obviously wants us to feel.",Rotten
Darfur Now does one thing other documentaries on the region in western Sudan haven't done so far: It offers hope that something substantive may be done about the Darfur genocide.,Fresh
Admirable work.,Fresh
A rallying call to aid Darfur and an uplifting case study in the power of individuals to effect change.,Fresh
"This is a feel-good film for activists, which barely scratches the surface.",Rotten
"A disquieting, and somewhat disjointed, call to arms.",Rotten
"The depressing subtext is that even with detailed proof of ongoing genocide, it takes movie stars to get to the movers and shakers, and to get worthy movies like this one into theaters.",Fresh
Informative and effortlessly gripping.,Fresh
"Slick, impassioned, and guardedly upbeat.",Fresh
"The title says Darfur Now -- not Darfur Then, not Darfur Sometime. But the question it asks emphatically is, Darfur Now What?",Fresh
"Braun is, in a sense, preaching to the choir...",Fresh
"Darfur Now has drawn criticism for its artless construction, and while it's true, he knows to step aside and let the passion of his subjects shine through.",Fresh
"Thoughtful, sobering, hopeful, despairing, inspirational, depressing, and just in time for the holidays comes Darfur Now, a documentary about genocide in the Sudan.",Fresh
A powerful testimony to the changes that may come when people make an effort to let their voices be heard.,Fresh
"While it's commendable that Cheadle and Clooney travel the world to promote awareness of the Darfur conflict, it doesn't necessarily make for a good 10 minutes of film.",Rotten
"Darfur Now will have to act as a moral entertainment, a conscientious objection we buy tickets to see.",Fresh
The movie works so hard to transform its shocking subject into acceptable material for middlebrow melodrama that it never deals with it.,Rotten
"One can't help but sense an edgier, braver film fighting to break free.",Rotten
As corny and joyful as anything you'd see on Turner Classic Movies.,Fresh
"It's superior Bollywood soap, saved by the acting, which just about manages to raise it above sud-level.",Fresh
"With Bunty Aur Babli, Yashraj had stuck a chord with small town India. I doubt if they would be able to repeat it with Lagaa.",Rotten
"Pradeep Sarkar's Laga Chunari Mein Daag is very aged wine - palatable, but with no strikingly new notes.",Fresh
"To describe the plot is to parody the film. Though impeccably acted and directed with a solemn, professional gloss, it sinks under the weight of its absurdity.",Rotten
This directorial debut by Clint's daughter gets stuck in a one-way dramatic track.,Rotten
A capable but modest directorial debut by Alison Eastwood.,Fresh
"[Eastwood's] gotten over the hurdle of making that first film; now, I want to see what she's really capable of doing.",Fresh
"Rails & Ties is definitely a heart-tugger, but it earns its tears modestly.",Fresh
"The opening act is strong, but the story's trajectory is so obvious this often seems to be traveling along tracks as well -- into a valley of soap suds.",Rotten
"It's becoming a bit tiresome watching Kevin Bacon suffer, and he isn't done any favors by this thudding weeper.",Rotten
"Mr. Bacon, Ms. Gay Harden and Mr. Heizer are talented enough almost to bring off this fragile conceit -- almost, but not quite.",Rotten
No amount of clunky train metaphors can cover up the movie's routine dramatic trajectory.,Rotten
"As lovely as some of the footage looks and as committed as are the three lead performances, they serve only to make Rails & Ties play like an exceptionally well-acted and well-made Lifetime movie.",Rotten
"There's a chance that a good film might have been salvaged from these questionable ingredients, but Eastwood opts for the tried-and-true approach of tearjerkers past.",Rotten
Scripts [don't] come any sudsier than Micky Levy's awesomely bathetic Rails & Ties.,Rotten
"No doubt about it, Alison Eastwood has picked up a thing or two from her old man. Her debut feature is slow, deliberate, assured, and shot with a graceful feel for place -- none of which is enough to overcome the creaky themes.",Rotten
"No one needed to pull the emergency brake to derail this movie, but they should have anyway.",Rotten
Alison Eastwood has a good eye for composition but misses out completely on bringing some much-needed rhythmic variety and humor to the maudlin source material.,Rotten
It's closer to a small kind of affecting and simply human story we rarely get to see in mainstream movies anymore.,Fresh
"While it features three strong performance and the debut of a promising filmmaker, the story line is obvious and rather melodramatic.",Rotten
"Alison Eastwood makes her directing debut with this ludicrous melodrama, in which a troubled couple and a newly orphaned boy heal each others' emotional wounds against a backdrop of blunt metaphors.",Rotten
"[Director Alison] Eastwood has the advantage of two very fine actors, Kevin Bacon and Marcia Gay Harden, who have the ability to lift the most mediocre of material into another realm.",Fresh
"A movie that should have had some more work done to it, and could have been better if it had, arrives with all its flaws carefully preserved.",Rotten
"The only conceivable reason for Warner Bros. to (barely) release this mush is as a favor to Clint Eastwood, whose daughter Alison directed.",Rotten
A modest but emotionally affecting drama.,Fresh
"Rails & Ties essentially remains a TV movie weepie, but it's a high-end one.",Fresh
"An hour and a half of emotional overload that you can either buy into and feel depressed, or reject and feel cheated.",Rotten
"Fortunately for first-time director Alison Eastwood, Rails & Ties is populated by three sensitive actors who tread carefully through Micky Levy's anachronistic script.",Fresh
"Heartfelt, compelling family drama, particularly for an adult, female audience.",Fresh
Rails & Ties is so self-consciously unadorned that it feels as if its director didn't want us to think that she was trying to make a cinematic statement. She hasn't.,Rotten
...ultimately redeemed by Kevin Bacon's expectedly engrossing performance.,Fresh
"While it has the appearance of a made-for-TV weepie, it's well-acted, technically proficient, a solid story with genuine, credible emotions.",Fresh
"In the right hands, this might be the stuff of compelling cinema. Instead, Rails and Ties sinks into melodrama.",Rotten
It's not all bad.,Fresh
The younger Eastwood tells her story with sledgehammer blows.,Rotten
"Either an unsuccessfully manipulative, sappy melodrama or the most deranged concept for a family sitcom anyone has ever developed.",Rotten
All the astute acting in the world can't bring such a preposterous story into the station on time and intact.,Rotten
"One highly unlikely circumstance after another become laughable, preventing you from being moved by the family tragedies depicted. They beg for tears, but a script this chock-full of holes is unlikely to elicit the desired effect.",Rotten
"Everyone involved will move on to bigger and better things and leave this series of unfortunate events behind on the tracks, waiting for a midnight train to put it out of its considerable misery.",Rotten
"I think somehow the filmmakers lost the way, lost sight of the people inside the plot.",Rotten
There's just not much here to recommend at all.,Rotten
The metaphors flow almost as freely as the tears in this sentimental weepie.,Rotten
"It's hard to get over the implausibility of the premise in Micky Levy's script, even though the characters themselves acknowledge that they're in a ridiculous situation.",Rotten
"Alison Eastwood has created a film of quiet delicacy, something fragile yet resolute, and shot through with a life affirming thread that is brave enough to suggest that sometimes life does indeed blossom from tragedy.",Fresh
DVD is the perfect place for a movie like Rails & Ties. Somehow it's easier to block out the often forced nature of the plot and just enjoy the rich performances and the humane themes.,Fresh
"Kevin Bacon turns in a solid, attention grabbing performance as a rigid, scornful man in a deep funk just trying to cling to a familiar world disintegrating all around him.",Fresh
"Feels so forced and determined to convey a certain emotion that its authenticity is lost. And when there's no sense of authenticity, there's no emotional attachment.",Rotten
"In common with her famous actor/filmmaker father, Ms. Eastwood seems to have an instinctual grasp of the petty grievances and triumphs of working-class American life.",Fresh
It gives the self-aggrandizing Barnes just enough celluloid to hang himself.,Fresh
"Marc Levin may avoid outright idol-worship, but any restraint exhibited by his film is disingenuous.",Rotten
"A fascinating first-person account of drug kingpin and ruthless gangster Nicky Barnes, whose outrageous story of rise, rule, rage, and revenge requires no such stylistic filler.",Fresh
"Marc Levin's biggest coup was actually finding Barnes and having him tell his story in his own words, which is ultimately the most interesting part of the movie",Fresh
"What is most intriguing in the film are the words, indeed the presence, of Barnes himself.",Fresh
"Legendary '70s heroin kingpin Leroy ""Nicky"" Barnes is filmed like a deposed king in exile in Mr. Untouchable, Marc Levin's slick look at one of New York's most notorious criminal masterminds.",Fresh
"It's fast and furious, and it proves that crime doesn't pay, unless you know how to do it right.",Fresh
"Nonjudgmental without being morally dense, the film makes human sense out of an inhuman example of addiction capitalism, '70s style.",Fresh
"Marc Levin, whose last documentary, Protocols of Zion, was a gutsy examination of post-9/11 anti-Semitism, has an even tougher job on his hands with Leroy 'Nicky' Barnes: making the man interesting.",Rotten
"Isn't an inside look at the men who ruled a city but just an excuse to collect 'Superfly,' 'Sexual Healing' and 'Let's Stay Together' on a soundtrack.",Rotten
What emerges is a portrait of a complex man.,Fresh
"Sometimes persuasive and sometimes sadly comical, but always fascinating.",Fresh
Levin was clearly captivated by the sheer spectacle of Barnes' career.,Fresh
"It's not a pretty picture, but it sure is a compelling one.",Fresh
Mr. Untouchable is never dull.,Fresh
Less a dispassionate examination than a celebratory infomercial on its central character.,Fresh
"[Director] Levin skillfully mixes the Barnes interviews with news clippings, 1970s street scenes and the recollections of Mr. Untouchable's former associates.",Fresh
"On its own, Mr. Untouchable is a solid education on a specific period of time reigned over by a demon who willingly spread sickness to line his pockets.",Fresh
A lackluster documentary that lionizes this creep while ignoring the damage that his distribution of drugs did to society and the many brutal murders he ordered.,Rotten
One seriously confused documentary.,Rotten
"Does the movie glorify Barnes and his nefarious profession? Probably, but show me a movie about the drug trade that doesn't hook us first with guts and glamour before the moralizing fall.",Fresh
"The principle at issue may not be plain to everyone, but ""to those people inside the system of values, that's totally acceptable.""",Fresh
"Like much of the story of Harlem in the '70s, the truth is the least important part.",Rotten
"If it casts a slightly too favourable eye over the subject and his social impact, you can't begrudge the director his understanding of and affection for the period and its people.",Fresh
"The only spiritual enlightenment I achieved was thinking ""Thank God that's over"" when the closing credits began to roll.",Rotten
"Completing Roadside Attractions' HOUSE was physically draining, which is something a viewer should never have to endure when in theaters. The adaptation of the novel by Frank Peretti and Ted Dekker is preachy, whiney and painfully clich√©.",Rotten
"Unsurprisingly, House fails to supply a sufficient level of fright; the picture seems content to wallow in confusion and convention, removing the novelty of faith to roll around in tired terror clich√©s and dreadful direction.",Rotten
Calling Extreme Makeover: HE. Your intervention is sorely needed at this disastrous would-be horror movie...from the same folks who gave you the awful Thr3e.,Rotten
The film doesn't achieve the horror or creep factor it could have%u2014or that the trailer seems to promise%u2014mainly because of strange stylistic choices.,Rotten
"Thankfully, the villains...keep things entertaining when they're on-screen, but too often take a backseat to tediously obvious flashback sequences.",Rotten
"The backstories keep piling up, with nods to The Shining, The Ring, and a dozen other gothic supernatural chillers, yet the result doesn't remotely scare you -- rather, it keeps explaining why you should be scared. That's why we're not.",Rotten
To say that mush-minded incompetence runs wild here would be to insult mush-minded incompetence everywhere.,Rotten
"I walked into the movie expecting to give it one star, or lower. Instead, it was just mediocre.",Rotten
"Like most movies where belief makes up a good percentage of the narrative rationale and resolution, House has a very hard time with its dogma.",Rotten
"The cluttered, unconvincing dialogue -- not to mention Moseley's ongoing penchant for crazed overacting -- make it more of a genre curiousity than anything the Fangoria gang would likely want to sit through.",Rotten
Christian-themed horror film too intense for kids.,Rotten
"Overall, the pacing and characters are where House suffers. The film works as a direct-to-DVD horror movie, but it definitely has its rocky moments.",Rotten
An unusually sensitive take on schizophrenia.,Fresh
"Auds will experience the joy of discovery in Greco's fact-based drama -- not just in its perspective on schizophrenia and the effect of the disease on one Florida family, but in Joe Pantoliano's cliche-demolishing performance.",Fresh
"The director happens to know the often maligned subject of mental illness well from his own childhood as the son of a psychotic mother, and he embraces it with genuine feeling, emotional spontaneity and absence of consciously formulated dramatic pretense.",Fresh
Writer-director Joseph Greco's refusal to explain the roots of Mary's madness gives John's desperate desire to summon happier days a bewitching poignancy.,Fresh
"Greco's sincerity is so palpable that the frequent uplift feels deserved, but with just-passable filmmaking and the demeaning score, Canvas falls somewhere between powerful indie and made-for-TV diversion.",Fresh
"Despite its admirable qualities, Canvas fizzles and falls into cliche.",Rotten
An absence of detail means that Canvas teaches little about what it's like to be mentally ill or to know someone who is.,Rotten
Greco succeeds where many others have failed in giving a real sense of what it is to grow up with a parent who's hobbled by mental illness.,Fresh
"Greco takes his biggest risk, perhaps, when he puts that boat in water with father and son manning the sails. It could be a mawkish scene that sinks everything that came before it, but like the watercraft that symbolizes so much, the movie remains afloat.",Fresh
I can see why it was a hit at film festivals. I only hope it now gets its due in theaters.,Fresh
First-time filmmaker Joseph Greco draws on personal experience for this devastating yet honest portrait of an ordinary Florida family.,Fresh
"Though Harden has the showier role, a subdued Pantoliano is the movie's real star. Sometimes, the quietest performances are the most powerful.",Fresh
"Canvas is a serious film about mental illness and a sentimental heartwarmer, and succeeds in both ways.",Fresh
"Canvas is a movie that rings emotionally true, despite structural contrivances and dim, washed-out color.",Fresh
"Small and slow-moving, and not in a way that means finely detailed and pensive.",Rotten
"Canvas is worth seeing for the acting, but the disease-of-the-week conventions and hackneyed visuals pretty well knock the wind out of its sails.",Fresh
Canvas just doesn't sketch a sufficiently vivid portrait.,Rotten
"Writer-director Joseph Greco makes a nice feature-film debut telling a true, disturbing story about a 10-year-old boy struggling to cope with a schizophrenic mother.",Fresh
"If it weren't for the terrific performances, Canvas would be a dull and lifeless film; Marcia Gay Harden explores the schizophrenic character of Mary with a judicial technique that is both compassionate and credible.",Fresh
[A] strong first feature.,Fresh
It's like a public service announcement with dialogue.,Rotten
"Movies don't come more personal than Canvas, writer/director/co-producer Joseph Greco's serious-minded exploration of the devastating effects unleashed by mental illness upon an otherwise tightly knit American family.",Fresh
"Though Canvas may not deviate much from the formula followed by so many other movies about families imperiled by health crises, it's unusually perceptive about the ways that loved ones process (or fail to process) the resulting stress.",Fresh
There is something to be said for a filmmaker like Greco who takes the truth -- no matter how tough it is -- and turns it into a compelling drama about people we might know in life.,Fresh
It's worth hanging on for where Greco goes with this.,Fresh
"...Skid Row too often comes to feel like a vanity project, with the focus of the film frequently shifting away from Skid Row's history and people to Pras's sketchy immersion in homelessness...",Rotten
[Skid Row is] less about finding humanity in the homeless population and more about realizing how a change of circumstance could lead even the most cocooned viewers to find dark inhumanity in themselves.,Fresh
"[Pras] has done something significant and substantial in terms of awareness of people who, for all their addictions and self-abuse, are still human beings.",Fresh
"An eye-opening and necessary look at a large, plain-view problem that most people would simply rather ignore.",Fresh
"Pras, one of the founding members of the hip-hop group The Fugees, goes undercover to shed light on the plight of the homeless.",Fresh
"When the most intriguing thing about a film is the production design, you know you're in trouble.",Rotten
"The songs are undistinguished, and while newcomers Sonam Kapoor and Ranbir Kapoor (who aren't related) both have impeccable Bollywood pedigrees, her performance is wildly uneven -- and his strenuously madcap antics are grating rather than endearing.",Rotten
How can it be that a movie as beautiful to look at as Saawariya is so...boring?,Rotten
"Of all the film's rococo pleasures-the lavish dance numbers, the dramatic rainstorms, and even the gold dust that puffs out when Sakina beats her rugs -- Mukherjee's richly textured diva is the most mesmerizing...",Fresh
Saawariya doesn't collapse but does wobble for much of its nearly 150-minute running time,Rotten
"A breezy and passably entertaining major Indian musical, the first to be released by a major Hollywood studio.",Fresh
"For audiences unaccustomed to the format, the film runs too long -- though it is short by Bollywood standards -- and is repetitive, sentimental and cliched.",Rotten
"Saawariya is 2 hours 11 minutes of wide-screen close-ups, fanciful sets, colorful costumes, bellybuttons, almost-kisses and 10 pumped-up, achingly sweet songs.",Fresh
"May not be the artistic milestone many have been hoping for, but as the first product of Bollywood's marriage with Hollywood, there should be pride from all corners for producing a solidly crafted entertainment.",Fresh
"Saawariya entices, fitfully springs to life but finally outstays its welcome by a good half-hour.",Rotten
See this movie if you need to get some sleep.,Rotten
"Disappointingly, neither India's most artistic director nor his new discoveries can prevent this song-packed extravaganza from being a beautifully crafted bore.",Rotten
Comes this close to sweeping us off our feet.,Fresh
"Entertaining ... Not all that different from America's love affair with MTV, American idol, and prime time TV offerings",Fresh
"With its lavish production design, extravagant sets, poetic musical numbers and photogenic stars, Saawariya is ravishing to look at, but disappointing overall",Rotten
"Ranbir Raj is a charming presence with moves that suggest a cross between Justin Timberlake and Gene Kelly, but the screen really comes to life when it's full of dancers.",Fresh
"Sony's first major delve into the lucrative global Bollywood market is an admirable, ambitious misfire.",Rotten
"Bhansali is a brilliant, visually ""wow"" film-maker.",Fresh
Saawariya is an act of supreme self-indulgence,Rotten
The lovely and fun-loving Aaja Nachle keys in on just the right tone to keep from seeming silly.,Fresh
"If history has taught us anything, it's that the effectiveness of a proposition such as Aaja Nachle depends almost entirely on charm. In this case, that invitation is all but irresistible.",Fresh
"As an undemanding slice of masala entertainment, it's more than worthy of the Yash Raj quality stamp.",Fresh
"For a film which invites us to 'come, let's dance', there is not a single number which encourages us to. Bring back the cheekiness of the choli!",Rotten
"Aaja is genteel and winsome and directed with restraint. Some of the best dialogue in recent times, resting on a core of quietude.",Fresh
"Does ace lensman Anil Mehta, who's first feature this is, pull it off? Not really.",Rotten
"Period detail is lovingly rendered (it's a nice touch to have people smoking in the cinema), while the technology is wonderfully '60s.",Fresh
"That old-fashioned does not necessarily mean musty is proven by Flawless, which does not entirely do its title justice but is a deliciously entertaining heist thriller nevertheless.",Fresh
Cleverly written and brilliantly made ... the type of classy and tasteful British crime-drama that Caine has long been associated with.,Fresh
"As far as what the filmmakers constructed, the spirit of the title term is close enough to forgive blemishes that don't really spoil the fun.",Fresh
"a classy, smart, and fiendishly sly piece of filmmaking that keeps the audience on the edge of its seat",Fresh
"It may not be as insensitive as Blood Diamond's inane examination of the diamond industry and its accompanying slave trade, but Flawless's utilization of the issue as a mere diversionary plot point is nonetheless plenty distasteful.",Rotten
A mediocre heist film with a preposterous finale.,Rotten
"[T]erribly earnest and, as a result, terribly dull...",Rotten
"It's good disposable entertainment that offers the right mix of character identification, plot unpredictability, and suspense to keep viewers interested throughout.",Fresh
"It's left to Caine to wink and nod at his own contribution to real caper classics of the 1960s and '70s, produced with more emphasis on fun and less on instructive fact-finding.",Rotten
Revealing when it needs to be and unpredictable when you least expect it.,Fresh
Flawless is anything but.,Rotten
As complex a mindbending crime caper as you could hope to wrap your head around.,Fresh
"The film is slight, sure, but it is also a lot of fun, and no amount of misplaced moralistic sermonizing at the end can steal those well-earned good vibes away from me.",Fresh
It is kind of a shame that it isn't getting a wider distribution because it is precisely the kind of intelligent adult entertainment that people are always complaining isn't being made anymore.,Fresh
"a flat, boring film where director Michael Radford fails to find the rhythm, danger and excitement of a caper movie.",Rotten
"Moore redeems herself from the mediocrity of her Brat Pack years and the career-killing mistakes of early adulthood. Having matured into a convincing middle-age actor, she comes across as intelligent, sophisticated and driven.",Fresh
The filmmaking and acting are so good it tingled my spine.,Fresh
"...a film that is at once a heist movie that feels sprung from its time and place and one that casts a modern eye on feminism, Apartheid and even health care...a solid little gem.",Fresh
"Michael Radford's leisurely paced Flawless digs itself into a deep, cavernous hole in its opening scene and never manages to crawl out of it.",Rotten
Flawless makes an entertainingly nostalgic journey to old Britain -- that black-and-white world we remember from long-ago Alfred Hitchcock and David Lean movies.,Fresh
"For all its stodginess, however, Flawless is a reasonably good time, for one reason. The reason's name is Maurice Micklewhite, better known as Michael Caine.",Fresh
"For the most part Radford turns in a hushed, marble-polished heist film with a genuine sense of tension and mystery",Fresh
"Priority numero uno in a heist movie should be making the robbery giddily dangerous, but Flawless has all the sizzle of a bank teller on Monday morning.",Rotten
"It's a satisfying picture enhanced by a few great sequences, and proves there's still plenty of life in heist cinema.",Fresh
"What distinguishes Flawless from other movies of the kind, unfortunately, is its absence of humor.",Rotten
"Flawless is the sort of movie that tends to get called 'enjoyably old-fashioned,' except that there's nothing enjoyable about it.",Rotten
How can an actress with Moore's carnal screen presence be so underused by carnally minded Hollywood?,Rotten
"The story aims to be a quaint, classy crime drama. But its quaintness comes off as laughably old-fashioned, and instead of classy, it's just plain dull.",Rotten
"For a movie about a diamond heist, Michael Radford's talky, 1960s-set Flawless lacks sparkle--despite strong period detail, earnest messages, and committed performances.",Rotten
A weak plot still makes a viable vehicle for a couple of great performances with some unbeatable screen chemistry and a good old fashioned plot twist at the end.,Fresh
Polished but oddly lifeless heist thriller.,Rotten
Caine alone is worth the price of admission.,Fresh
Those of us who'll happily watch Caine in pretty much anything will find enough pleasures here.,Fresh
"This is supposed to be a caper movie. Shouldn't it have a heroine who looks as if she could, you know, conceivably, caper?",Rotten
The plot contortions that very slowly unfold under Michael Radford's arthritic direction in Flawless are not much...entertaining.,Rotten
"There is a nice sense of style, and appreciation for tense face-to-face confrontations among characters trying to ignore the temptations around them. It's sort of the opposite of the current robbery flick The Bank Job - all substance and no flash.",Fresh
"Though the central mystery does hold one's interest, tin-eared dialogue, unlikely staging and dramatic conveniences all work against our being swept up in the chicanery.",Rotten
"A nicely made if slightly stodgy jewel heist flick that offers Michael Caine one more juicy, low-key role and Demi Moore another step back up the ladder to career revival.",Fresh
"Flawless is a gimcrack, a genre exercise, yet it's a confidence game in the best sense of the phrase. [Director] Radford knows the rules - when to bend them, when to break them, and when to play by them. That's an increasingly rare skill.",Fresh
"Flawless, directed with a fine eye by Michael Radford, is a diamond-heist thriller that will make you nostalgic for the smart, classy caper films of a certain era.",Fresh
"Flawless is a fictional tale, but something in director Michael Radford's conscientious, methodical presentation gives it the feeling of true history. Watching it is like watching a historical dramatization of something that never really happened.",Fresh
"Despite a finale that fails to live up to the promise of its premise, Flawless still manages to be a polished throwback to the great British crime thrillers of the '60s, and a welcome return to form for director Michael Radford.",Fresh
"Flawless is a mildly diverting period heist movie in which an odd couple conspire to loot an evil London diamond company, for which they both work.",Fresh
"At least the picture's title is apt -- as a work of preposterous implausibility it is, indeed, without any redeeming flaw.",Rotten
"An enthralling bauble of many facets: part feminist thriller, part ""howdunnit"" mystery, and all good old-fashioned story.",Fresh
"Michael Caine's performance in Flawless is just that. As for his co-star, Demi Moore ...",Fresh
This is an old-fashioned escapade that respects everyone's intelligence and allows you to cheer for the underdog. Moore actually plays an age-appropriate character who handles the heavy burden that represents women at the time with depth and aplomb.,Fresh
[It's got] some neat little twists and turns.,Fresh
"Unlike Ocean's Thirteen, this formulaic heist movie has a streak of psychological perversity.",Fresh
Where are the truth in titular advertising police when you need them?,Rotten
"May not live up to its title, but when Caine's onscreen it definitely sparkles.",Fresh
"The inspired pairing of Demi Moore and Michael Caine as a pair of thieves in the diamond-heist semi-caper movie Flawless goes a long way toward overcoming the film's slack, leisurely pacing.",Fresh
This is a first rate caper piece elevated by Caine's effortlessly elegant portrayal.,Fresh
Retro London heist caper may not interest kids.,Rotten
"If not worth its weight in gold (or diamonds), at least worth the price of a movie ticket.",Fresh
Banal or bogus.,Rotten
"Flawless isn't impossibly joyless, but it's a lot less fun than it ought to be...",Rotten
"Like the diamonds that motivate its characters, Flawless"" has a pretty surface but not much else.",Rotten
"It's a work of brilliant cut, color and clarity that delivers on almost all of its ambitious promises.",Fresh
Screenwriter Edward Anderson drops the South African angle in favor of more conventional developments and has a hard time bringing this across the finish line without a number of implausibilities.,Rotten
"There are better heist films, but none of them are showing at your local movie theater this month",Fresh
"It seems irresponsible, if not downright stupid, for the makers of any movie to call their feature Flawless. But the most current film to sport that risky title has a number of serious storytelling flaws.",Rotten
"The answers to its most intriguing puzzles disappoint, and the final motive provided for this near-perfect scheme can only be described as flawed.",Rotten
"May not quite live up to the daunting implication of its title, but as a solid piece of beautifully acted and precisely written filmmaking, you'll find nothing better.",Fresh
"The picture is mildly entertaining, aided strongly by the retro period and Caine's authoritative performance. As for Moore, the script doesn't offer her much - certainly not the intensity that brought her equal parts fame and derision.",Rotten
"I think if the script had some tweaking, this could have been a great heist film. Instead, it's just another mediocre one.",Rotten
"For about 100 of its 108 minutes, this film treats the viewer to a stylish, suspenseful roller coaster peppered with all manner of ugly, money-grubbing corporate types.",Fresh
"Demi Moore is excellent as the catalyst for the crime caper with a profoundly personal motive, something we don't discover until late in the film, and Michael Caine is wonderfully dry as the office cleaner with an agenda",Fresh
"What a cast - Michael Caine, Demi Moore, Joss Ackland. Yet here it is, released at the fag end of the year just in case anyone notices. It makes you despair.",Fresh
"There's little by way of thrills. Still, as a caper with a great cast and clever premise, Flawless works, despite its, um, flaws.",Fresh
"The problem is that as heist movies go this is about as captivating as watching someone dodge a bus fare. Almost everything about the film is second-rate: the direction, the plotting, the intrusive modernist production design.",Rotten
"Ignore the dull framing device and this is a watchable period crime drama. Pity about the dull, oft-used title though.",Fresh
Fatuous and soulless.,Rotten
"You will need a very sweet tooth for this kind of thing, and, to be quite frank, the heist itself is not dramatised all that excitingly or clearly. But I quite like thrillers featuring enormous circular vault doors.",Rotten
"Calling a diamond-heist movie Flawless is a valiant choice - especially when it's anything but. Suspense is essential to this genre, but here you couldn't care less what happens next.",Rotten
"""Hang on lads, I've got a great idea..."" said Michael Caine at the end of The Italian Job. Presumably he didn't mean waiting 40 years before pulling off a caper that wouldn't blow the bloody doors off a rabbit hutch.",Rotten
Diamonds aren't forever in this sluggish heist caper from Michael Radford that partners Michael Caine and Demi Moore for the first time since 1984's Blame It On Rio.,Rotten
"They don't make thrillers like this any more, and for good reason.",Rotten
"Like many Christmases, the whole thing leaves you stressed, exasperated and longing to leave for home.",Rotten
"If ever a film title begged to be abused, this is it.",Rotten
"Demi Moore will do as the ghost of Hollywood past, rattling her jewelled accessories like a drag-queen Jacob Marley.",Rotten
If only the plot was as sleek.,Rotten
"A creaky, below-par Brit heist caper that belongs in a dusty vault itself.",Rotten
"Yet for all the imperfections, Flawless is a film you find yourself rooting for. Heists involving a keen sense of history are pleasant to stumble across.",Fresh
"Enjoyable heist thriller with strong performances from Moore and Caine, though the ending is slightly disappointing.",Fresh
"Terrific performances elevate this extremely low-key heist thriller into something thoroughly intriguing. It may never crank up much excitement, but the 1960s vibe it generates is very cool.",Fresh
A mopey character study only half-convincingly tricked out as a heist thriller.,Rotten
The bad pacing and strange infatuation with Moore smoking and wearing high heels results in a picture that lacks snap and labours slowly through the plot twists.,Rotten
"The film delivers what it promises as a freewheeling, bitchy-mouthed romantic comedy, so it's a good date movie. Perhaps newlyweds, too",Fresh
"This tone-deaf flick from hack screenwriter Dana Fox, is an example of a Hollywood formula romantic comedy where the author never properly learned the recipe.",Rotten
"Though utterly contrived, predictable, and disposable, this counter-proragmming date flick has a certain charm, due to Cameron Diaz's sex appeal and ease with slapstick and her onscreen chemistry with lead man Ashton Kutcher.",Fresh
"There are no big surprises, and only a handful of unexpected developments. But Kutcher and Diaz are undeniably appealing...nd the scene-stealing supporting players...go about their petty larceny with amusing adroitness.",Fresh
"While Diaz and Kutcher work through their stock repertoire of winsomeness, the second bananas steal the show.",Rotten
Ashton Kutcher and Cameron Diaz hate on each other with dynamite verve in What Happens in Vegas.,Fresh
"Raunchy romantic comedy has a softer side, too.",Fresh
This breezy confection should work well corralling it's target demo to come up triple 7s for Fox if the marketplace can handle yet another rom com.,Fresh
"Sadly, about the nicest thing I can say about What Happens in Vegas is that I didn't hate it -- although I suppose that's something.",Rotten
Like Mr. and Mrs. Smith without the action or The Break-Up with less depth--if that's even possible...,Rotten
"I didn't laugh much, and I never felt even an inkling of 'aw, cute!' romance -- but I didn't want to claw my eyes out, either. If that counts as a success, then I guess it's a hit.",Rotten
A distinctly awful cover version of 'I Want A New Drug' plays on the soundtrack and is a direct thought to the audience who is going to need something a lot stronger to make it through this unrelentless excuse for a romantic comedy.,Rotten
The good news is that the movie itself is nowhere near as disastrous as that trailer made it appear. The bad news is that the darn thing still isn't all that great.,Rotten
"As tepid romantic comedies go, they forgot to pack the fun. This one should have stayed in Vegas.",Rotten
"The battle for the human heart has official morphed from witty, sophisticated banter between star-crossed lovers to something akin to mixed martial arts.",Rotten
"'What Happens in Vegas' has a similar structure to 'Knocked Up,' only it has neither the unplanned pregnancy, nor the laughs.",Rotten
So moronic it almost makes the recent mediocre Made of Honor seem sophisticated by comparison.,Rotten
"If I had anything kind to say about Ashton Kutcher and Cameron Diaz before this film, I'm ready to take every word back...a shrill monstrosity of a romantic comedy.",Rotten
What Happens In Vegas can be forwarded directly to the nominating committee of the Golden Raspberry Foundation.,Rotten
"A first- or second-date flick, after which there can be some Cheesecake Factory and maybe a peck on the cheek, no harm done. What Happens in Vegas is pleasant enough for all of that.",Fresh
"Not that What Happens in Vegas is any kind of great movie, but it's an exceedingly bright comedy that never makes you feel stupid for enjoying its brisk pacing, smart lines, sound construction and superb comic acting.",Fresh
...has nothing to recommend it but the sight of Ashton Kutcher in a pink boa wearing a yard long glass in a cocktail sling...This one shouldclearly have stayed in Vegas.,Rotten
"Despite the presence of some likable, funny people, it's a painfully unfunny romantic comedy that makes you dislike those same people intensely.",Rotten
"The film gives a transparent spin to the saying that whatever happens in Vegas stays in Vegas, but Diaz and Kutcher bring a surprising sweetness to their generic roles and the story's contrived situations.",Rotten
"What Happens In Vegas is about as silly and pleasant as it needs to be, no more, no less.",Fresh
"I am so tired of these miserable things that pass for romantic comedies these days, thoughtless assembly-line products that recycle the same components in ever-dumber packaging over and over again.",Rotten
"What Happens in Vegas, one of those junky time-wasters that routinely pop up in movie theaters, won't make you laugh much or at all.",Rotten
Complain all you want about the affable slobs in Judd Apatow comedies; at least they're not tools.,Rotten
The overall sour tone and worn-out feel of the movie overwhelm any positive aspects.,Rotten
"So many things, small and large, erode any sense of fun here. The movie looks like crud -- like it, too, stayed up and drank all night.",Rotten
"Though a notch above Made of Honor on the tolerability scale, Vegas takes a shot at love with all the romantic know-how of Tila Tequila.",Rotten
"The stars, despite having only a fraction of the charm and talent of classic sparring-but-meant-for-each-other duos, know how to mug for the camera and well up on cue, and somehow that turns out to be enough to carry this trifle.",Fresh
"You can take what happens in Vegas, keep it in Vegas, and keep the rest of the us out of it.",Rotten
"What Happens in Vegas . . . should have stayed in Vegas. Or in New York, where most of this predictable, uninspired film takes place. Or in Hollywood, where such lamebrained ideas are hatched.",Rotten
"What Happens in Vegas is evidence that putting two attractive stars together onscreen is not enough to make a good, or even passable, 90 minutes of entertainment.",Rotten
Ashton Kutcher has his first real hit movie -- even with the predictable ending.,Fresh
"While watching insipid romantic comedies, I often cling to the comic supporting characters as my life preserver.",Rotten
Full-contact marital warfare connects with every body part save the funny bone.,Rotten
"With a script that only barely hangs together by the skin of its teeth, this romantic comedy survives on the considerable charm of its terrific cast.",Fresh
"The plot is both feeble and ridiculous, but this still delivers more than its fair share of laughs, thanks to terrific comic performances from Kutcher, Diaz and supporting players Rob Corddry and Lake Bell.",Fresh
"With likeable actors like Ashton Kutcher and Cameron Diaz who aren't afraid to go over the top for comedy, What Happens in Vegas turned into a pretty good film.",Fresh
"Scream, scream, scream. When did writers get the idea that what audiences find really funny in comedies is screaming? A full-out assault on your senses, the film isn't just bad. It's painful.",Rotten
What Happens in Vegas contains enough unbridled silliness to salvage its lowbrow high concept.,Fresh
What Happens in Vegas... should have stayed in development -- forever. This ramshackle -- and occasionally repulsive -- farce doesn't even deliver on the minimal promise of its title; most of it takes place in Manhattan.,Rotten
"What Happens in Vegas refuses to take a gamble. Like a bleary-eyed gambler repeatedly tossing a pair of dice, it tiredly goes through the motions.",Rotten
"When a movie depends on supporting characters to tell the audience just how good the romantic leads are together, you know you're in trouble deep.",Rotten
"Here's a romantic comedy that is goofy, highly implausible, sometimes over the top, often in bad taste, and resolutely empty-headed. In short, it's the best example of its genre to appear on the screen this year.",Fresh
"Why do we have to suffer through movies like What Happens in Vegas, which is the worst-in-breed not only for this year, but very likely in living memory.",Rotten
What happens in Vegas is nobody has much fun.,Rotten
"We all know what happens in Vegas -- and we know, without having to watch it, what happens in this movie.",Rotten
"Considering that the title of the movie was conceived by the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority, it's not a huge surprise that What Happens in Vegas is stocked with product placement.",Rotten
"You'd think the combination of Diaz, Kutcher and Vegas would be good for at least a little sexy, silly fun. But don't bet on it.",Rotten
At least they party harder than the 21 kids.,Fresh
"Directed by Tom Vaughan and written by Dana Fox, who also wrote the excruciating The Wedding Date, this film often seems improvised, and not in a good way. Some setups go nowhere, and some jokes never get set up at all.",Rotten
Screenwriter Dana Fox (the dreadful Wedding Date was hers) and director Tom Vaughan can't find much fun or romance in this. What Happens in Vegas ... offers none of the surprises that screen comedy so desperately needs.,Rotten
You know how some movies feel like they were made by a committee? What Happens in Vegas feels like it was made by checklist.,Rotten
"It's called What Happens in Vegas, but it should have been called What Happens in Hollywood as it pretty much defines contrived studio comedy.",Rotten
"For an idea of the level of wit, several gags are built around the name 'Dick Banger'.",Rotten
"While Diaz and Kutcher make their clich√©d characters as likable as possible, you can bet on this: Any movie named after an already-stale ad campaign isn't likely to gamble on the unexpected.",Rotten
"What Happens in Vegas is about as bubbly as flat champagne. While aiming for an intoxicating blend of high-energy comedy, the romantic comedy's predictable story, and the lack of chemistry between stars Diaz and Kutcher, don't leave it withmuch of a kick.",Rotten
"The latest uptight chick/slacker dude romantic comedy is so formulaic, you could win big if you placed bets on what's going to happen next.",Rotten
"What Happens in Vegas feels oddly stilted yet desperate, as though its principals felt the need to overcompensate for the too-neat symmetry of opening scenes with over-the-top violence and bright orange tans.",Rotten
"A PG-13 sitcom rom-com that desperately wants to be a Judd Apatow movie when it grows up, Tom Vaughan's flat film mixes screwball comedy with self-help clich√©s to tired effect.",Rotten
It's a testament to how good casting can help a film and bad writing can hurt it even more.,Rotten
"None of this is anything we haven't seen countless times before in rom-com land, of course, and it would be giving the filmmakers way too much credit to say they have entertainingly tweaked a winning but cob-webbed formula.",Rotten
"The outcome of What Happens In Vegas is obvious, but the journey there is fun.",Fresh
Ashton Kutcher and Cameron Diaz almost pull off Vegas despite everything. And there's quite a bit of everything.,Rotten
Who knew the title wasn't simply clever (inviting the rejoiner 'stays in Vegas') but a dire warning of a bad movie ahead?,Rotten
"It was inevitable that an annoying catchphrase would one day become the title for an annoying movie. What Happens in Vegas is not only annoying, it's also incompetent -- a bad mix.",Rotten
"Though likely not a film you'll remember a month after seeing it, it does hit most of the right notes for a good date flick.",Fresh
The felicitous pairing of Cameron Diaz and Ashton Kutcher overcomes the mechanical setup of this amiable screwball comedy about mismatched Manhattanites who wed in Las Vegas following a drunken first date.,Fresh
When it was over I felt vaguely embarrassed. I wasn't just leaving a movie theater. I was taking a walk of shame.,Rotten
"What Happens in Vegas is the kind of terrible mistake performers as big as Cameron Diaz and Ashton Kutcher usually make at the beginning of their careers, when they're anxious to break into the movies, or at the end, when they're struggling for a comeback",Rotten
"What happens in Vegas is exactly what you would expect: It's formulaic, slapsticky, silly and loud, until it goes all gooey in the end.",Rotten
Joy and Jack are fated to fall in lazy-movie-love.,Rotten
The supporting players save What Happens in Vegas from rom-com infamy.,Rotten
...one can't help but wonder if there's anything of interest left to say within this increasingly stale genre.,Rotten
I like to learn something every day. In this case I discovered a harsh truth. You can have slapstick without the comedy.,Rotten
What Happens in Vegas is a clever concept lamely executed.,Rotten
What Happens in Vegas . . . boasts the not inconsiderable appeal of good-looking people having a good time -- even while having a bad time.,Fresh
"What Happens in Vegas should damn well have stayed in Vegas. Instead, the thing has leaked out as a movie that, one grey morning this week, swiped 100 minutes from my life.",Rotten
Bland enough to make millions as culture edges closer to oblivion.,Rotten
"Amid the bright lights, Cameron Diaz and Ashton Kutcher fail to generate even the faintest of erotic sparks.",Rotten
"not a complete lost cause, but no one tries to emerge from the icky goo known as mediocrity",Rotten
"The end result is easily the worst romantic comedy that you will find in theaters this weekend (or possibly this year) and yes, I am fully aware that ""Made of Honor"" is still playing.",Rotten
"Are you laughing yet? Are you moved by these incredible insights? Are you, most likely, looking for the exits?",Rotten
"I just don't know what to make of a scene in which a judge sentences two selfish jerks to ""six months hard ... marriage,"" but I'm simply too old and too smart for material this insipid.",Rotten
"Lucky for viewers, it's easy to laugh while watching this romantic comedy, mostly because of the comic skills Kutcher and Diaz bring to their performances.",Fresh
Not the sin some claim it to be.,Rotten
"Wants to be liked so badly it's afraid to do anything that might actually make you respect it in the morning. In that sense, it works. It's a 99-minute PG-13 airplane movie good for a few chuckles and another notch on Rob Corddry's widening comedy belt.",Fresh
"Kutcher and Diaz both make good with what they have, but they deserve better.",Rotten
"Kutcher has talent and potential. It has been his misfortune to attach his star to people who aren't up to the quality of his talent. He has time to correct this, but the clock is ticking.",Rotten
"I can't recommend it as a must-see date night getaway, neither will I discourage audiences looking for a little bit of mindless rom-com fun. And given the likable nature of the film's two stars, this trip to ""Vegas"" coasts by on just enough charm to make",Fresh
What should have stayed in Vegas is this movie.,Rotten
The colorful second bananas' bawdy badinage turns out to be a lot funnier than that of the co-stars who have little more to offer than their looks and sexual chemistry going for them.,Rotten
"A movie that just seems to be going through the motions, a thoroughly uninspired rehash of a formula done far better elsewhere.",Rotten
Two fresh stars elevate the material into solid entertainment,Fresh
Middling and forgettable.,Rotten

The formula is too contrived and the chemistry not enough for any genuine sparks to fly,Rotten
"This film is not the equivalent of brain surgery, but it is entertaining.",Fresh
"If you can ignore some rather silly moments and focus on the credible relationship between Jack and Joy, this will be reasonably entertaining.",Fresh
"What Happens in Vegas is a sorrow attempt at a romantic comedy. So let the saying stand What happens in Vegas, should stay in Vegas.",Rotten
"Ultimately, What Happens in Vegas resembles a drunken night in Sin City; when it's over, you don't really remember what happened except that it wasn't good.",Rotten
"Diaz and Kutcher restore the original, ebullient meaning of 'sex comedy'. They're fun to watch, which is a rare thing in this Zellweger, Clooney, Kidman, Gosling, Apatow world.",Fresh
"Hardly a massive gamble, Cameron Diaz and Ashton Kutcher play a safe romcom hand you can tolerate.",Fresh
What happens in this seriously flawed would-be romantic comedy is Nothing Much.,Rotten
"It's less obnoxious than Fool's Gold, less forced than Made of Honor and less formulaic (well, by a sliver, anyway) than 27 Dresses.",Rotten
Pleasantly forgettable.,Rotten
"It's a sure bet you'll realize ""What Happens in Vegas"" is a by-the-numbers romantice comedy within the first 15 minutes.",Rotten

"attempts nothing novel in its retelling of the couple who don't realize that they are perfect for each other, aside from positing an unsavory new popcorn topping",Rotten
"Both Kutcher and Diaz are in full-on desperation mode, straining in each scene to prove they can still be relevant, showing flashes of the charm that made them famous in the first place.",Rotten
"During the screening, I tried to come up with as many synonyms for the word ""excruciating"" as I could.",Rotten
"Should have stayed, not in Vegas, but elsewhere in the state of Nevada. How about those mountains where they are supposed to store the radioactive waste?",Rotten
"From seeing this movie and talking to several moviegoers, I discovered that there are two kinds of people: people who like Ashton Kutcher, and people who don't.",Rotten
I only wish they'd have spent more time drunk and in Vegas in the whole movie. Alas...,Rotten
The combined verve Diaz and Kutcher bring to the table saves a routine time-killer from being entirely forgettable.,Fresh
This derivative rom-com works best when the leads are exacting revenge on each other.,Rotten
"As far fetched as the idea of guy disgust as the ultimate aphrodisiac may seem, Cameron and Ashton as the designated lovebirds keep the kinky marriage shocks and surprises coming. Move over Knocked Up. A Sex And The Sin City Vegas jackpot.",Fresh
"Another predictable romantic comedy, one that insists that spending time locked into an unhappy marriage doesn't breed contempt, but sows love. [Blu-ray]",Rotten
"What Happens in Vegas has mediocre direction and a strained screenplay, so how can it be any good? What carries the film is its two stars. If Ashton Kutcher bothers you, you'll probably hate What Happens in Vegas. If Cameron Diaz leaves you",Fresh
"a funny movie about the sexes that doesn't diminish either gender in its execution--a tougher task, obviously, than one would presume.",Fresh
The high-concept plot is so formulaic and predictable it feels more like software than script.,Rotten
"Standard-format rom-com, with a mismatched Ashton Kutcher and Cameron Diaz doing the quick-to-bicker, slow-to-bond thing.",Rotten
What happens in Vegas? The same stuff you've seen in every B-grade romantic comedy for the last 50 years.,Rotten
"Old fashioned Western, a meditation on honor, courage and camaraderie, is well helmed and acted, but commercially, it might fall between the cracks: It's too grown-up for young viewers and too familiar as a psychological Western for adults.",Fresh
"A finely textured, riveting Western that marks a welcome return to a classic American genre. Bristles with violence and humanity",Fresh
It is the romance that sets Appaloosa apart.,Fresh
...modern in its playfulness while never seeming not of its period. Harris and Mortensen are good enough together to warrant another adventure.,Fresh
"When you're lookin for an Olde Time, pistol-wieldin', rootin', tootin' varmint, hire somebody other than Jeremy Irons. What is this--Bonanza Revisited?",Fresh
"While he thankfully avoids the actor-filmmaker avenger fantasies of The Three Burials of Melquiades Estrada, Harris doesn't have the genre chops to fill Appaloosa's empty spaces.",Rotten
"Appaloosa is a pleasingly spacious piece of work, but for all of its little tangles it never musters the kick of a psychological duel.",Fresh
Appaloosa demonstrates a better sense of history than Paul Thomas Anderson's hysterical There Will Be Blood. But Harris isn't a good enough director; he loses the mythical air that drives home a great Western's point.,Rotten
"Ed Harris reunites with Viggo Mortensen, his co-star in A History of Violence, and the chemistry is easygoing and understated. But he should have left the direction to someone else.",Rotten
It's high time for the western to be resuscitated as a genre; a picture that just pokes along amiably isn't enough to get the job done.,Rotten
"The bullets may not be comparable to the Yuma remake or Kevin Costner's underrated Open Range, but the men holding the guns are still the same. So what if they're just a little bit different?",Fresh
"too authentic to be populist, yet too familiar to transcend the genre and hang with the bona fide classics.",Rotten
Bring back Hopalong Cassidy and Randolph Scott and you've got the making of a respectable horse opera.,Rotten
Appaloosa is gripping entertainment that keeps springing surprises.,Fresh
"A satisfying journey that doesn't require too much examination, just an appreciation of the scenery and what it took to get by during this period of American history.",Fresh
"In the early going, Appaloosa does an efficient job of establishing the tense standoff between lawmen-for-hire Ed Harris and Viggo Mortensen, and a tyrannical rancher (an extravagantly sinister Jeremy Irons).",Fresh
"If you're someone who orders the usual and is just happy when it comes out warm and fresh, I reckon Appaloosa will sit with you just fine.",Fresh
"Crackling eccentric verbal wit as Harris' marshal seeks to 'button up this town tighter than a nun's corset' while overcome by Zellweger's irresistible flirty charms, because she 'chews her food nicely and even takes a bath before going to bed.",Fresh
Appaloosa satisfies all its requirements but never breaks a sweat.,Fresh
"It could be said that Harris and his co-writer, Robert Knott, haven't done a whole lot of writing, but as Cole himself might say, there's no need to get all fancy with what's plain and true.",Fresh
"Appaloosa has a solid enough opening, and it should be fun just to watch things play out, what with the shootouts, the trains, the swagger at gunpoint. But the script (co-written by Harris) is alternately dumb and lifeless.",Rotten
"Appaloosa will probably just ride off into the sunset without much of an impact, but it will sate your fix for horses, guns and slapping leather. You know, if you're into that sort of thing.",Fresh
"Mannered, episodic and slow.",Rotten
It's a pleasure to watch such gifted actors interact in a classic genre.,Fresh
"It's both dull and preposterous, which neither Dean Semler's somberly handsome score nor Jeff Beals' pushy, cornball score does anything to ameliorate.",Rotten
Harris follows his strong helming debut Pollock with a contribution to the western movie revival that looks and sounds like a classic.,Fresh
"Ed Harris has the kind of head that would look great on a coin, but it looks even better on a movie screen, as he turns his chiseled features this way and that.",Fresh
"Beautifully photographed by Dean Semler, Appaloosa is the best Western since Open Range and shows there's still life in this most unfashionable of genres.",Fresh
"Though the leads do fine work, their efforts often feel slightly futile.",Fresh
"It's unfortunate for everyone concerned, and for the film, that the train chugs into town one day.",Rotten
"Throughout, the repartee between Harris and Mortensen never feels less than broken-in and believable.",Fresh
"Luscious enough photography and fun to watch, ""Appaloosa"" brings nothing new to the table. As a collection of things that have been done before who will watch it over the originals?",Rotten
"Appaloosa shows a square jaw and a steely gaze, but also a smile and a wink.",Fresh
"The top-heavy plot takes over, and the picture makes a beeline back to tepid convention.",Rotten
"A smart and funny script, highly entertaining from the first draw, Appaloosa is a taut, captivating tale of the old West with enough bite and modern edge to draw in both fans and non-devotees of the cowboy genre.",Fresh
"Jeremy Irons is miscast as the film's politically driven baddie, but the easy rapport between Harris and Mortensen more than compensates for the minor misstep.",Fresh
"The parts of it that work, work very well... so much so in fact that the parts which don't simply can't keep up.",Rotten
"Ed Harris and Viggo Mortensen have mastered the art of subtle communication, amplifying the believability of their relationship in this ruggedly male bonding tale.",Fresh
"Harris and Mortensen are out to get Irons, and their plan appears to be to talk him to death. It took a lot of stretching to get this to last for two hours.",Rotten
Where the film lets you down is in the boundaries of the dramatic map which needs a more dynamic (and cinematic) driving force.,Fresh
The various symbols never coalesce into metaphor so much as they stand stagnant and hollow at the edges of the frame.,Rotten
"In all, Appaloosa is good as far as it goes -- everything in it feels true -- but I wish that Harris had pushed his ideas further.",Fresh
"Appaloosa is entertaining, certainly, but it feels rather slight and feeble next to some of its more superior recent cohorts in the western genre.",Fresh
"Can Ed Harris, of all people, save the Western for this generation?",Fresh
Squinting Zellweger ruins it. I liked the hats.,Rotten
"In another era, Harris -- and Mortensen, for that matter -- would have already starred in several westerns. Harris should do more of them; only next time, much less carefully.",Fresh
"The best western since 3:10 to Yuma, which is to say it's a western.",Fresh
"While there's nothing particularly original about the plot, the characters and the way they interact with each other are strikingly played",Fresh
"Enjoyable, frequently offbeat western with an intriguing script and terrific performances from Harris and Mortensen.",Fresh
"This, though, is not so much a comedy as a western with the ironic undertones that someone like Hawks would appreciate while telling a story such as Rio Bravo.",Fresh
The plot is engaging enough but this is best viewed as a buddy movie with a dynamite duo at its core.,Fresh
"Too much romance makes the movie sag near the end and the plot could have gone in a more interesting direction. But if you are wild about Westerns, saddle up for Appaloosa.",Fresh
"In all, it's a magnificent ride and certainly one of the finest films of the year.",Fresh
"If a western is going to be this slow, it needs to have a lot more tension, and deeper meaning, than this one.",Rotten
"A classics-steeped western that rams home tradition over reinvention, Appaloosa kicks it hard as a buddy pic on horseback. Harris and Mortensen's study in laid-back companionship is the principal pleasure, leaving Zellweger mired in role that does her and",Fresh
"As comfortable as an old saddle and as sharp as an Apache arrow, this a Western for the modern era.",Fresh
"A pity that Harris's homage to westerns should be compromised so intrusively. For most of its length, in terms of its themes, pacing and visual sweep, it's a treat.",Fresh
"Photographed handsomely with wide-angled majesty, the film does precious little myth-making, though Harris subtly twists some of the genre's conventions.",Fresh
"This is no revisionist western designed to shock life into an unfashionable genre, rather a film that respects the conventions of the traditional western.",Fresh
"A western that moseys along in amiable style, largely thanks to the chemistry between Harris and Mortensen.",Fresh
"These are horse-opera fundamentals; having given them short shrift, the film just shuffles down its lonesome trail into the horizon and out of your memory.",Fresh
"These days, westerns are a dying breed, uncommonly found in multiplexes. Appaloosa is the latest reason why.",Rotten
"Ed Harris, working from a Robert Parker novel, has crafted a meticulously detailed, newfangled old-fashioned morality tale of hard men who go soft when a woman comes between them.",Fresh
This is an honest tale of the camaraderie between a pair of lawmen simply trying to do a job.,Fresh
"Actor turned filmmaker Ed Harris wants to go back to the days of simple sagebrush storytelling, and with one major exception, everything he does...is nothing short of brilliant.",Fresh
Harris proves that there is still some life yet in a genre that has essentially been left for dead for nearly four decades at this point.,Fresh
"""Appaloosa"" doesnt re-invent the Western, and thank goodness for that.",Fresh
"...one heck of a western, one that will join the ranks of ""Unforgiven"" and ""3:10 to Yuma"" as modern classics.",Fresh
"... a well-told, thoroughly enjoyable and refreshingly direct buddy Western, and that's more than enough.",Fresh
There is plenty of plot but not enough story. And the film unfolds in short scenes strung together that beg to be expanded into more detailed examinations of behavior.,Rotten
"[Harris's] performance as the usually quiet but quick-to-action gunman is terrific, and he's smart enough to leave much of the narration duties and such to the soft-spoken Mortensen.",Fresh
"Appaloosa is an archetypal western with touches of the modern buddy comedy. Though it falls short of these classics, it is a little bit Destry Rides Again and a little bit more Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid.",Fresh
"Vastly entertaining in the old-fashioned ways: fun story, fun characters, fun everything.",Fresh
What is seductive about Appaloosa is its easygoing rhythm.,Fresh
"Ambition is a great quality in a filmmaker, especially when it's realized. Yet there is something to be said for just telling a story, and with Appaloosa, Harris does a fine job of it.",Fresh
"Harris's adoration for the genre is clear, and his Appaloosa is a fine addition to a growing list of neo-westerns incorporating a respectful tone, ideal aim of violence, and heartfelt observation all in the same breath.",Fresh
Takes the old western conventions and juggles them in very odd but mostly satisfying ways.,Fresh
"With Wayne's gruff arrogance, Eastwood's squinting revenge eyes and Stewart's ambling cool, Harris carves a daunting figure.",Fresh
Appaloosa is firmly grounded in genre orthodoxy even as it teases at the edges of nonconformity. The results are decidedly mixed.,Fresh
"Dialogue, much of it lifted straight from Parker's novel, proves mostly engaging.",Fresh
"It's deliberately paced, but this non-Western-fan loved it.",Fresh
"Harris displays a quiet, unshowy confidence and a genuine fondness for the genre, capturing the horses and guns and saloon glasses in a soft, almost-sundown light.",Fresh
"Harris co-wrote, directed and stars in the film, which is filled with humor, action and clever turns.",Fresh
Appaloosa carries a whiff of feminism. Or at least an awareness of what life was like for women on the frontier.,Fresh
"There's a refreshing vein of understated humor running throughout the production. It's neither forced nor unnatural and it keeps things from becoming too somber, even when the bullets start flying.",Fresh
It lacks the substantial story that would make it memorable.,Rotten
"From its first, mournful brass theme, Ed Harris's Appaloosa nails the look and feel of a classic Western. This is an old-style, laconically macho, six-shooting horse opera made with an obvious and unapologetic love of the genre.",Fresh
Emotionally Appaloosa shoots blanks.,Rotten
"After Appaloosa establishes its slightly modern characters in a traditional setting, it has nowhere to go but toward the completely expected.",Rotten
Harris directs with a steady hand and sharp eye for the best in his fellow actors.,Rotten
"Mortensen should certainly do another western, soon. Preferably he should do one with a real sense of danger to go along with all the neat, tidy, highfalutin' honor and decency.",Rotten
In its own quiet way it delivers the goods.,Fresh
"A warmly made, slightly offbeat movie about friendly devotion. It also happens to be a western, and every man in it is grizzled or wizened or both.",Fresh
"The movie brings back the danger and the humane humor of strong, silent men of action.",Fresh
"A suitable slow burn punctuated by sudden acts of violence; it fairly oozes off the screen like bloodied molasses, and then, heated, bubbles up and over, all smoke and fire and endless clouds of New Mexico dust.",Fresh
"'Appaloosa' might be described as a routine Western, except that in the moviegoing culture of 2008, there's nothing routine about the pleasures of a well-made and entertaining Western.",Fresh
...a classy entry that's as much about the moral choices facing the characters as the horses and six guns.,Fresh
Standard western finds comfort in its familiarity.,Fresh
... a classical Western that invites us to savor no-nonsense camaraderie between two shootists for hire.,Fresh
"Quiet, contemplative and with an astonishing climax that spins the film on its head and gives it meaning and nuance I almost didn't see coming, this is a story of male friendship that's both stirring and powerful.",Fresh
"Filled with dusty light, craggy facial features and broad landscapes, it's a solid story that honors the traditions of the genre as it reworks them.",Fresh
"For its first hour or so, Appaloosa is a crisply paced pleasure, mostly thanks to the interplay between Harris and Mortensen.",Fresh
"Appaloosa is a familiar story told well enough that it's worth seeing, but won't truly linger for any but the most diehard Western fanatic.",Fresh
"With a cast and director like this, you would expect greatness. What you really should expect is a cup of coffee so you can stay awake.",Rotten
"I love a good western, so I am not very enamored with Appaloosa. I guess you can say I just want to be friends with it.",Rotten
"Hardly a fresh perspective on genre traditions, it's still got the performances and glorious landscapes to win you over.",Fresh
"A fine dramatic comedy with fresh characters, witty dialogue and a keen interest in how relationships must have developed among frontier folks, tyrannical ranchers, no-nonsense lawmen and -- oh, yes -- the complicated women on that frontier.",Fresh
Ed Harris' labor of love is a welcome return to the classic westerns of yore.,Fresh
"Clearly not worried about modern action conventions, Harris' movie is a traditional Western in every sense of the word, and it seems weird to call it 'new' at all.",Fresh
"Harris' easy byplay with Mortensen, his economical dialogue and his stately camerawork of the New Mexico landscape combine for a smart, dynamic Western.",Fresh
If it feels a bit like an old Howard Hawks western (no slacker with the subtext himself) -- that's not a bad thing.,Fresh
Plays on conventions so smoothly that we're never distracted from the ride.,Fresh
...so old-fashioned it even carries a troubling dose of old-fashioned sexism.,Rotten
Zellweger's Allison zaps Virgil of his almost superhuman qualities and the film eventually becomes ordinary when the love of a woman interferes with the law.,Fresh
"It's a rousing, efficient western that is about the friendship of two men, just as much as it is about getting the bad guys.",Fresh
Harris and Mortensen radiate a rugged integrity...,Fresh
Very disappointing ---- I was so in the mood for a great western!,Rotten
We just want the movie to ride off in the sunset to rest among all the other disappointing westerns in Boot Hill.,Rotten
The chemistry of Ed Harris and Viggo Mortensen makes 'Appaloosa' a huge film in the way it gets under your skin and into your heart.,Fresh
Appaloosa takes the traditional notion of a lone lawman fighting injustice and turns it successfully on its head.,Fresh
Sometimes Appaloosa seems bent on exploiting the standard cliches of the western genre ...while at others it seems striving to be a modernist update full of ambiguity ...,Rotten
"For those of you who yearn for Westerns like ""3:10 to Yuma"" and ""Tombstone,"" here's another one you should reach for.",Fresh
A welcome return to the roots of the western genre.,Fresh
"The film is more trenchant character study than thrilling showdown, and it confounds as many generic expectations as it fulfills.",Fresh
"A gentle, warmly human and quietly compelling western with a wry sense of humour and some engaging performances from a group of fine actors.",Fresh
"The first hour bored me nearly to tears, but I'm glad I stuck it out, since the last half hour is fresh, diverting and original in the context of a neo-Western. Or a neo anything.",Fresh
"It isn't a bad film, but the pacing drags it down to the level of just another horse opera when it could have been so much more.",Rotten
"Viggo Mortensen's brilliantly cool performance engenders enough good will to see ""Appaloosa"" through its pokey meandering to an intriguingly philosophical conclusion: a look at modern outsourcing, capitalism and progress through a Western prism.",Fresh
"A fine cast produces a surprisingly low-key outing. It sports a plot like a Western from 45 years ago, but pacing familiar from LONESOME DOVE.",Fresh
"It was at times incredibly slow and even poorly edited, and I've never understood the appeal of Renee Zelwegger.",Rotten
Ed Harris does it better than anybody.,Fresh
No ordinary oater.,Fresh
Ed Harris' howler of a vanity piece.,Rotten
The film's subtle humor and detailed character studies reflect careful attention to detail and superb craftsmanship.,Fresh
A better than average western in the Clint Eastwood tradition,Fresh
Appaloosa is ideally suited for fans of the genre for whom quiet drama speaks as loud as big guns.,Fresh
A terrific bread-and-butter Western.,Fresh
A western bromance.,Fresh
"Uma produ√ß√£o correta e que prende a aten√ß√£o especialmente gra√ßas √† din√¢mica entre Harris e Mortensen, mas que, no fim das contas, n√£o exibe nada que a torne diferente do convencional.",Rotten
"...provides enough variety to keep the heart, mind, and adrenaline on alert.",Fresh
"Nothing new or groundbreaking here, just a lot of talented people coming together for a well-made and entertaining Western.",Fresh
"I give thanks for westerns. Every time they seem to be about to gasp their last, dusty breath, one comes along to give them a bit of renewed life. Bless it, the western genre will not die. Last year it was the excellent remake 3:10 to Yuma. This ye",Fresh
"Harris has made himself a reputation as a mark of quality...Like Pollack, Appaloosa has the best of both worlds, with Harris both in front of and behind the camera. [Blu-ray]",Fresh
Brush away the dust and you'll find a sense of nostalgia and romanticism about lost American values and altered social hierarchies.,Fresh
"Viggo Mortensen is a trustworthy ally in the project, an actor whose extraordinary range enables him to move his performance along the scale from 0 to 100 at will.",Fresh
"Wearing not only his actor's lawman hat, but also that of director and co-screenwriter, Ed Harris delivers a splendid film, filled with nuances, complexities and substance",Fresh
"True, the film is a little long, and it loses momentum at one stage, but generally speaking this is a most enjoyable return to what was once the cinema's most popular genre.",Fresh
There's considerable pleasure in Appaloosa's respect for the undramatic. It doesn't go where you'd expect...,Fresh
"A dusty, old-fashioned Western with a dusty, old-fashioned vibe. You can all but smell the saddle soap as the story unfolds.",Fresh
old-fashioned but simple and effective entertainment,Fresh
Old-fashioned Western features great performances.,Fresh
A droll Western with an odd romantic triangle.,Fresh
"Really, it's like watching three amigos passing the time of day in New Mexico while waiting for a call from Cronenberg.",Rotten
"It is as though Harris could not decide whether he was making the classic western of his boyhood dreams, or merely a pastiche of it. The result, falling somewhere between the two, ends up being neither here nor there.",Rotten
"The requisite standoffs and shootouts make this one tense film, but the mood is frequently lightened with a generous dose of surprising humor.",Fresh
"The film neatly blends short, brutal violence with a surprisingly traditional visual take on the classic western.",Fresh
The story is just not strong enough to carry the entire movie.,Rotten
"It's more Harris's attention to dialogue, character and the film's overall production design that makes the film so memorable.",Fresh
"The often impressive Mortensen can't make Halder much more than a stereotypical academic milquetoast. Other perfs come off just adequate, though not for lack of effort.",Rotten
"For Amorim, who only claims his second feature with Good, it's best to see the film as a next step towards honing the quality storytelling skills needed for making successful movies.",Rotten
"Good is an admirable though poorly-executed adaptation of Scottish playwright CP Taylor's 1981 play about the rise of Nazism. But it never acquires the play's philosophical weight, dramatic power or provocative imagination.",Rotten
Absorbing drama about a good man who is blind to the horrors of Germany's Nazi regime.,Fresh
One's ability to wholeheartedly embrace the story is consistently hampered by the distinct atmosphere of staginess and artificiality...,Rotten
"Despite Mortensen's heroic effort, Good is simply not good, a failed version of a stylized, powerful play of ideas about the devastating price of conformity.",Rotten
Good feels more self-important than satisfying.,Rotten
"Mortensen evidently thought that a stuttering and maddeningly tentative delivery renders the man, as written, understandable, or creditable, or sympathetically good.",Rotten
Sincere but stilted adaptation of the 1980s stage play dissecting a German intellectual's embrace of the Nazi Party.,Rotten
A character study of a Nazi quisling that's frequently too muddled to reach even the level of banality.,Rotten
Decidedly blunt and unaffecting.,Rotten
"Despite its rather highbrow pedigree, Good's journey along its predetermined path from book burnings to concentration camps reeks of middlebrow button-pushing, which the cast's clipped British accents do nothing to dispel.",Rotten
An ambitious move about a Nazi professor played by Viggo Mortensen that never really grabs hold of us because it's difficult to identify with the main character.,Rotten
"Good is pretty schematic ‚Äî betraying its theatrical roots, perhaps. It's also a little drawn out. But it demonstrates the surprising power of character flaws in drama.",Fresh
A really terrible movie based on what I imagine was a far more interesting 1981 play.,Rotten
A subtle and quietly devastating film directed by Vicente Amorim from John Wrathall's delicately written adaptation of a play by C.P. Taylor.,Fresh
"Though the film opens with an intriguing burnished look, it bogs down about halfway through with talkiness and uneven pacing. When reality finally dawns on Halder, it is not only too late for him to redeem himself, but too late for the audience to care.",Rotten
"To those who wonder if we really need Hollywood to give us more Holocaust stories, I would argue yes, just better ones than we get with Good.",Rotten
Good is an anemic screen adaptation of C. P. Taylor's play about a respectable 'good German' who passively acquiesces to Hitler's agenda.,Rotten
'Good' bares its heart on its sleeve way prior to its closing dedications.,Fresh
It definitely wouldn't have done anyone involved with Good any harm to ask what relevance heavy-handed history plays have to do with the world of today.,Rotten
"Morally speaking, everything about Good is tidily correct. But it is more a predictable parable than a full-fledged narrative.",Rotten
"There are some striking locations and certainly the era continues to fascinate audiences (and, particularly this year, filmmakers). Too bad, then, that this is such a disappointment -- awkwardly directed and flatly scripted.",Rotten
"We know just what each character will do, and exactly where each path will lead. And we're never wrong.",Rotten
"The banality of evil has met its match in the banality of Good, a Holocaust parable that barely registers a pulse.",Rotten
Viggo Mortensen looks the part but never brings it home with great conviction or passion. I never believed in the character and that greatly diminished the film's ability to argue its ethical case.,Rotten
"The banality of evil is a rich subject; the cluelessness of same, not so much.",Rotten
A worthy attempt to give the banality of bureaucratic evil both an individualized credibility and a somber universal warning,Fresh
Fails to convince that this man could remain so removed from the horrifying events unfolding around him.,Rotten
"It's a powerful film on its own merits, but it also points out how tame and impotent The Reader is in examining similar issues.",Fresh
No actor has ever looked less comfortable in a Nazi uniform than Viggo Mortensen does...,Fresh
"Good has a stagy fustiness, but it's worth seeing for Mortensen, who makes this study of ‚Ä® a 'good German' look creepily contemporary. He shows us the horror ‚Ä® of ignorance.",Fresh
Good contributes very little to a conundrum that has occupied historians and psychologists for half a century.,Rotten
The subject -- self-deception and failure of nerve in an unjust world -- is too messy and horrible to laugh away.,Fresh
"""Good"" is good news for Viggo Mortensen in that he gets to flex his acting chops in a new direction. But thin directing and screenwriting fail to provide the power needed to bring his performance to life.",Rotten
"Good has solid performances, but it has a hollow emotional core and, ultimately, lacks any enough insights and suspense to keep you truly intrigued.",Rotten
"Amorim and screenwriter John Wrathall have produced a compelling intellectual exercise, a movie that openly wrangles with complex ethical territory",Fresh
This film contributes to the important debate about morality in times of political trauma and oppression of personal freedoms,Fresh
"Despite a strong performance by Viggo Mortensen and a tangible melancholy mood that reflects his character's inner conflict, the result is a disappointing and muted affair that keeps us at arms' length, when our emotions should be at their most vulnerable",Rotten
This adaptation is drab and lifeless enough to make one suspect it was never much of a play in the first place.,Rotten
"It's not up there with The Conformist, or even The Reader, but it's well worth your time.",Fresh
"It inevitably leaves a mark upon you, but with a more considered portrayal, it could have permeated the viewer like an indelible stain.",Fresh
"Despite its limitations it is about an important issue, how easy it is to compromise yourself, your ideals, your friendships in times of stress.",Fresh
"Mortensen ably carries most of the weight, with a minimalist performance.",Fresh
"This isn't gritty realism; it's a morality tale, and it's made with quiet passion and real power",Fresh
"Viggo Mortensen stars as Prof John Halder - far too handsome for such a part: in life, the bookish are usually ugly as sin, let's face facts.",Rotten
"Ultimately Good, like its central figure, seems to lack the courage of its convictions.",Fresh
A strong cast and good starting material doesn't manage to save this unsuccessful adaptation.,Rotten
"By all accounts, Taylor's play was a more experimental piece than this film, in which the production values, like the acting, veer between the acceptable and the stodgy.",Fresh
"Not for the first time, great theatre makes for a merely adequate film.",Rotten
"It's a thought-provoking theme, which is rather let down by a thoroughly unconvincingly turn from Mortensen.",Rotten
"To its credit, Good is at least a piece with something serious to say, with little of the meretricious responsibility-deflecting that The Reader dealt in.",Fresh
"We're gearing up for a clunker of a climax involving musically gifted interns at the world's sprucest concentration camp. Mortensen wears it well, but this feels like very old hat.",Rotten
"Good's attempts to diagnose the cancerous spread of Nazi influence through Germany's population in the mid-'30s is laudable, but despite Mortensen's stoic talents Halder is just too hollow a character for this to be anything other than a vapid parable.",Rotten
"The point is how does a ""good"" man get seduced by evil? Thing is, the movie's so muted and keeps viewers at such arm's length, you cease to wonder.",Rotten
"It is a fine piece of acting from Mortensen, who portrays his character's weakness superbly. But Good sometimes lacks pace and direction. On balance this is an intelligent and sensitive approach to a very dark era of history.",Fresh
"It may have been a good stage play: people say it was. But its author, the late C.P. Taylor, was not around to stop it becoming a lousy film.",Rotten
"Mortensen isn't bad, though he looks merely absent-minded rather than anguished.",Rotten
"There are gripping moments of tough, muscular moral tension, mainly when Isaacs steps in, but these are dissipated by occasionally cringeworthy dialogue and a limply executed bourgeois subtext.",Rotten
"The original play, once dubbed one of the 100 best of the century, is fleshed out with skill by Amorim but somehow his film never comes fully to life. Even its melodramatic ending falls flat.",Rotten
"Despite strong performances and decent production design, Good lacks the emotional weight it needs to deliver the requisite punch. Disappointing.",Rotten
"Set in that weird film version of Nazi Germany full of RADA-trained Home Counties poshos, Good is, in a sense, an amazing achievement- it makes the Holocaust boring.",Rotten
"There's probably a great film to be made about the way ordinary Germans succumbed to the allure of Nazism - but this weakly directed film, adapted from CP Taylor's acclaimed 1981 stage play, isn't it.",Rotten
A tale illustrating the banality of evil is as timely as ever but the execution is heavy-handed and even with location filming and elaborate sets it still feels very theatrical.,Fresh
Good isn't great. The film has a quality cast who turn in fine performances in a movie that aims to be profound but isn't.,Rotten
"Bears a superficial resemblance to ""The Conformist"" and ""The Garden of the Finzi-Continis,"" with their sense of dreary complacency, oppressively museum-like spaces, and curiously drab natural settings, but ultimately ""Good"" is less evocative",Rotten
"... unfortunately in the end and the adjective ""good"" does not sit well with this film. [Full review in Spanish]",Rotten
"A film that is a combination immigrant/resurrection tale, Visitor tilts toward the soulful rather than the political and could be this year's humanistic indie hit.",Fresh
The performances are very strong and the film is very well-written.,Fresh
Actor-turned-filmmaker Tom McCarthy demonstrates that the critical acclaim for The Station Agent in 2003 was no fluke.,Fresh
...rife with compelling figures that ultimately sustain the viewer's interest even through a few less-than-subtle moments.,Fresh
Much more interested in its interpersonal relationships than it is in climbing a soapbox and preaching to the choir.,Fresh
"Finally an effective, timely and enjoyable political melodrama that contests stereotypes and centers on culture collision between Americans and Muslims, with tour de force, Oscar-caliber turn from Richard Jenkins as the emotionally sheltered professor.",Fresh
Focused entirely on these people and how the unplanned relationships affect their lives.,Fresh
"A marvelous film, small in expense but big in stature.",Fresh
The Visitor's allusions to our f----up state-of-affairs feel like gratuitous background noise.,Rotten
"If McCarthy is the divinity of the universe he creates, its patron saint is Frank Capra ... The primordial truth about Capra's and McCarthy's characters is that if you scratch beneath the surface, just about everyone is decent.",Fresh
Jenkins does a great job with the material and Tom McCarthy's latest is quality work that deserves attention.,Fresh
"This audaciously issues-loaded indie drama works, improbably and entirely, on account of the marvelous, often familiar-looking, rarely starring character actor Richard Jenkins and his perfect performance as a stodgy, widowed economics professor.",Fresh
This is a simple story of human drama that provides an incentive to spend a couple of hours in a movie theater during a spring that has not provided many such reasons.,Fresh
"Tom McCarthy's The Visitor, from his own screenplay, is nothing short of a triumph for 60-year-old character actor Richard Jenkins, in his first leading role in a feature film.",Fresh
This is a small picture that explodes the boundaries of what size really means. Sometimes it's the smallest gesture that makes you feel most alive.,Fresh
"The curious thing about The Visitor is that even as it goes more or less where you think it will, it still manages to surprise you along the way.",Fresh
"The Visitor, featuring an award-caliber performance by Richard Jenkins as the prof, is a heartfelt human drama that sneaks up and floors you.",Fresh
"A polite, gentle drama about friendship and musical expression, ""Visitor"" dances slowly, but effectively, working its way to the heart.",Fresh
"The Visitor is a low-key, naturalistic, beautifully observed character study about the quiet angst of the buttoned-down soul.",Fresh
"Dull and depressing, The Visitor is leaden, lethargic and full of heavy-handed symbolism. The Statue of Liberty keeps popping up in the movie, which uses it like a cheap stage prop.",Rotten
"McCarthy unquestionably means well, but he's made one of those incredibly naive movies (like last fall''s Rendition) that give liberals -- Hollywood liberals especially -- a bad name.",Rotten
"Far too much of a mixed bag to be completely effective, but allows for some fun and unexpected moments and solid performances.",Fresh
"All the main characters are inherently decent, and the humanity of their saga, which centers on illegal immigration, makes for a deeply moving film.",Fresh
"[Director Thomas McCarthy] demonstrates a delicate, irresistible touch when it comes to lonely, eccentric characters, but he widens his canvas with a small, resonant story that could be ripped from today's headlines.",Fresh
"Best movie I've seen so far this year? Hands down, it's Tom McCarthy's superb The Visitor, which turns Richard Jenkins, one of the best character actors in the business, into a full-fledged star.",Fresh
Both director and cast exhibit the dedication of those who truly believe in the message at hand.,Fresh
"The movie is writer-director Tom McCarthy's follow-up to his 2003 debut, the well-liked The Station Agent, and it shares that film's offbeat, humanistic spirit.",Fresh
"McCarthy is so careful not to take a political stand that his film seems neutered by good intentions. In the spirit of squishy humanism, he soft-pedals a hard-hitting topic.",Rotten
"The Visitor tells of renewal through love. Its song is tinged with sadness, but stirring all the same.",Fresh
"Actor/director Tom McCarthy's follow up to his award-winning debut, The Station Agent, avoids any notion of a sophomore curse by being an even more polished effort than his debut.",Fresh
"Depicts the way a professor's closed-off heart is opened by music, friendship, and love; one of the most touching and impressive films of the year.",Fresh
"While elements of this are sad, at times even downright devastating, the film is ultimately a beating drum signaling the arrival of hope and inspiration.",Fresh
"Character actor Richard Jenkins gives a performance that is at once restrained and speaks volumes, a breakthrough to leading man status after decades of supporting roles.",Fresh
Scores by expanding its scope beyond the hot-button issue of illegal immigration to encompass themes of friendship and breaking free of a stifling routine.,Fresh
Makes political points via a fascinating tale of an unlikely friendship between people of vastly different cultures.,Fresh
"Not a polemic, but a character-driven work, made all the more riveting by sensitive performances not only by Jenkins in his first leading role, but the entire cast.",Fresh
Insightful drama shatters post-9/11 stereotypes.,Fresh
"In The Visitor, Jenkins finally gets a starring role, and he makes the most of the opportunity with a brilliantly sustained performance that gives depth, resonance and spiritual transcendence to what starts out to be one of his stock characters.",Fresh
"The Visitor gives viewers a perceptive, deeply personal take on the timeless immigrant narrative, in which the most epic journey is finally one of self-discovery.",Fresh
"Both halves of the story ring true in their way, but they don't ring out in harmony.",Fresh
"Richard Jenkins and ""The Visitor"" make lovely music together. It's a case of a veteran character actor slipping on a leading role like the most comfortable pair of pants in the world.",Fresh
"Thoroughly, refreshingly unique, a film that weaves a tight, timely tale that is equal parts heart-warming and wrenching.",Fresh
"not really a film you enjoy, per se. It's more like a feeling you get used to before finally accepting.",Fresh
This gifted writer/director knows how to illuminate those moments in which people realize they have become essential to each other -- that each person's life has been gently changed by the other's presence.,Fresh
"McCarthy puts a mark on each film, identifying it as distinctly his own. A couple more like them, and he'll be knighted an auteur.",Fresh
Small but sincere.,Fresh
"This is a film of our times -- paranoid, heartbroken, disillusioned -- and the rare recent American movie whose characters react the way actual people might.",Fresh
"These characters feel like they exist before the cameras roll and after the credits are done, and it is the audience who are the true visitors, inspired by just getting to spend some time with them.",Fresh
"The film addresses the timely issues of post-9/11 immigration and incarceration, but avoids polemics by keeping the focus solely on the human cost of our government's policies.",Fresh
"A wonderful human story, a beautifully directed and acted film of rare grace that just might renew your faith in life- and movies.",Fresh
"The Visitor is America working out the demons of Sept. 11, 2001. Director Thomas McCarthy brilliantly focuses on characters who love life despite the less savory circumstances surrounding them.",Fresh
The script here is very strong.,Fresh
[Richard Jenkins] gets the role of a lifetime in this powerful second film by writer-director Thomas McCarthy.,Fresh
The film works foremost as the experience of watching Richard Jenkins inhabit his role.,Fresh
"The Visitor is best enjoyed as a chance to see some new faces, or old faces like Jenkins', doing new things.",Fresh
"The Visitor is a small movie, but its emotions could not be writ any larger.",Fresh
"Awards season may still be many months away, but it's not too early to declare both the filmmaker and Jenkins Oscar-worthy.",Fresh
"A smart, beautifully acted character drama.",Fresh
The film becomes less about the suffering of immigrants who have never enjoyed the embrace of Ellis Island than the righteous indignation of a liberal intelligentsia raging against its own powerlessness.,Rotten
"The story of Vale's revitalization and his grief is compelling but simple, free of any sentimentality, and marked by powerful performances from Jenkins and Hiam Abbass, who plays Mouna Khalil, Tarek's mother.",Fresh
The Visitor is a small film; it's also an incandescent one.,Fresh
Definitely a film that marches to its own drumbeat.,Fresh
This is one of those surprising little gems that make you happy to be an ardent moviegoer.,Fresh
"This is unquestionably one of the most moving motion pictures you will ever see, and yet, at film's end, you will be left wanting for more.",Fresh
"A lovely, quietly touching film that approaches a provocative and topical subject with dramatic sensitivity and graceful understatement.",Fresh
"The movie is grounded in a fundamental difficulty, that Walter's education is achieved by his engagement with this set of brown and black people.",Rotten
"Poignant, intelligent, thematically nuanced and character-driven, The Visitor is a drama about illegal aliens in which the native son is the brother from another planet.",Fresh
"[Director] McCarthy has an undeniable way with actors, and it sustains our interest in this overt Good Samaritan tale.",Fresh
(Richard) Jenkins doesn't waste a motion or a word while bestowing on us an introspective acting clinic. They don't call them character actors for nothing.,Fresh
"At first glance Walter isn't a guy you want to spend two hours with. But by the end of the film, you don't want to see him go. Jenkins is like that: He sneaks up on you and steals your heart with light-fingered skill.",Fresh
"The Visitor is a tiny treasure of a movie. This is a wistful comedy that quickly finds its rhythm, but never lets that groove become a rut.",Fresh
"The real subject here isn't post-9/11 xenophobia but rather friendship, how it changes us, heals us and how the arbitrary intrusion of outside forces both threatens and strengthens us.",Fresh
As close to a perfect movie as we're likely to see this year.,Fresh
"The Visitor may not have any big names in its cast, but it certainly makes up for that by having a lot of character.",Fresh
"Jenkins, a veteran character actor perhaps best known as the dead father on Six Feet Under, gets the role of a career here...",Fresh
"It's almost funny how often and how closely The Visitor teeters toward clich√©, only to deliver one gently genuine moment after another.",Fresh
The Visitor might unite both sides of the illegal immigration debate - at least for two hours.,Fresh
"Sophisticated, timely and compelling, it's a quintessential post-9/11 drama.",Fresh
... I almost want to regurgitate that shawarma I once ate.,Rotten
"Beautifully acted and staged, but at odds with itself: the emphasis is not on the 'visitors' but on the uptight professor, who experiences a spiritual rebirth thanks to the life-affirming presence of his new Third World friends...",Fresh
Cuts across one of the West's most contentious political issues without ever getting political. And it features a terrific lead performance from Jenkins.,Fresh
...a literate and low-key character study of an ordinary man in depressingly average straits.,Fresh
A gently moving film that can warm your heart as easily as break it.,Fresh
"The charms and wonders of the film lie in the performances of the leads, all of whom are better than perfect -- they feel real.",Fresh
The beautifully restrained performance by [Richard] Jenkins is the anchor of a film built around complex characters and quiet moments.,Fresh
"For those who want to see slowly evolving character studies that are very rewarding, THE VISITOR is a bullseye.",Fresh
"Surefire material to pluck the heartstrings and for thesentimentally inclined, but...",Fresh
"The Visitor presents a rich, complex world where people connect in unexpected ways. It is a fitting follow up to the themes McCarthy covered in The Station Agent.",Fresh
"...extremely well-written and well-acted, but it was far too politically biased...it reminded me of a Soviet or Chinese Communist propaganda film.",Fresh
...a celebration of multiculturalism as an American virtue.,Fresh
"Beautifully cast and superbly performed, The Visitor never steps off the mark either emotionally or in character development. Richard Jenkins, usually in support roles, rises to the lead occasion with grace and a marvellously restrained performance",Fresh
This is an exquisite and subtle character portrait and all the performances are wonderful.,Fresh
The tension dips occasionally but stick with it and you'll be richly rewarded.,Fresh
"A beautiful, quiet, measured movie about the death of some American values since September 11, 2001.",Fresh
"It's a lovely, moving film, marked by memorable performances throughout.",Fresh
"Dabbles in messages and liberal guilt, but more importantly, it sets up a reasonable and genuine space for a fascinating and heartbreaking character.",Fresh
"It is a lovely, well-crafted, bittersweet little film.",Fresh
"Uplifting and undeniably winning in its perceptive landscape, The Visitor is no stranger to compelling filmmaking rooted in gentleness and inspirational fortitude",Fresh
A character study drowning in liberal guilt.,Rotten
"Exactly the type of movie the GOP would rather Americans not see, as it individualizes (rather than demonizes) its foreign characters and provides them with a collective voice that demands to be heard.",Fresh
"A showcase role for otherwise supporting actor Richard Jenkins, and he makes the most of it without ever being showy.",Fresh
"Jenkins, as always has a quiet, almost apologetic hesitation to his performance that serves him well as Walter....a very sweet and gentle film.",Fresh
The not-so subliminal message about life being fair versus breaking the law isn't enough to carry a film purporting to be a character-driven drama.,Rotten

The Visitor gives Richard Jenkins a chance to develop a character for the whole running time.,Fresh
"First with ""The Station Agent"" and now with ""The Visitor"" (aka ""Muukalainen""), actor-turned-director Tom McCarthy has quickly proven himself a master of the delicately-observed social drama.",Fresh
"THE VISITOR begs the question, ""Is too late to try something new?"" If your like the rest of the world, you want the answer to be ""Never."" THE VISITOR answers that in one of the most beautiful and heartbreaking ways you'll ever see.",Fresh
"The Visitor, a quiet, touching film about a lonely economics professor's encounter with a Syrian man presents an interesting counterpoint to another movie that tackled the subject of immigration in 2008: Gran Torino.",Fresh
"A haunting, gentle film about humanity post-9/11; lonely, confused, and searching for meaning and connection in an increasingly confusing and chaotic world.",Fresh
Richard Jenkins is a mesmerizing presence in the film.,Fresh
"He's a professor of music, the young man is a skilled drummer; the emotional ebb and flow between the two is nuanced, and self-revelatory for those who drink it in.",Fresh
"Husband-and-wife helmers Melisa Wallack and Bernie Goldmann make all the wrong choices, from the grimacing they've encouraged their large (and largely wasted) cast to indulge in, to the musical riffs that signal each and every dramatic beat.",Rotten

...basically entertaining yet entirely forgettable.,Fresh
"Clunky and smug, Meet Bill isn't convincing for one moment.",Rotten
"Even a hilarious turn by Kristen Wiig as the owner of a doughnut company can't save this clich√©d, meandering story from playing like American Beauty lite.",Rotten
"Takes scattershot aim at all manner of appropriate targets-the vapid nature of local television news, the perceived stigma of standing out from the pack in America, the dilemma of dreams deferred and abandoned-but rarely hits the comic bull's-eye.",Rotten
"Male midlife crisis presents as pathological self-loathing in Meet Bill, an imperative to which the only sane response is: No thanks.",Rotten
This movie never should have seen the light of day.,Rotten
"For those whose idea of hilarity is an adult and a kid throwing fireworks at each other, then getting stoned and playing piggyback in the mall, this movie should be a refreshing tonic.",Rotten
"As the movie goes on, you actually end up rooting for this schmuck to take charge of his life, and in a way, the movie is sort of inspiring.",Fresh
"It tries hard to mimic the arch tone of the best suburban tragicomedies (American Beauty, et al.), but a surfeit of stock characters, double-wide plot holes and heavy-handed symbolism ruins the effect.",Rotten
"The story of a man (Aaron Eckhart) grappling with middle-age ennui at work and at home feels done to death, as does the distracting addition of a spunky rich-kid high schooler.",Rotten
"Not awful or offensive, but pretty weak broth nonetheless.",Rotten
"It doesn't take long for Bill to suddenly veer off course into total impenetrability, where the characters become a blur, the hacky visual poetry is rolled out, and the plot drops dead.",Rotten
Not even a solid performance can keep the script's problems at bay.,Rotten

"Screens within screens, frames within frames -- that's the simplest way of approaching Married Life's allusive/elusive roundelay.",Fresh
"Teeters between film genres, not ever quite making up its mind what it strives for.",Rotten
The film is hampered by a plodding and unimaginative script whose situations are pedestrian and whose dialogue is much less sparkling than the filmmakers appear to think it is.,Rotten
You know you're in trouble if the wallpaper is more exciting than anything that happens in front of it.,Rotten
"Pic is dramatic but lacks a dynamic; one can sense the director's intent and affection for the form, but also see that working in this stylized vein does not necessarily come easily for a filmmaker of his hitherto more naturalistic tendencies.",Rotten
"Sexual deceit is what wins the day, without judgment. Interesting%u2026 but I kept waiting for the other shoe to drop.",Rotten
"Doesn't have much to say about marriage other than that it's complex, and often fraught with disappointment, deception and conflicting urges.",Rotten
delves into the subtext of conventional American society before progressive politics and the counterculture changed everything.,Fresh

"When the characters in Married Life cry out for help, the entire mise-en-sc√®ne stifles them with irony.",Rotten
"A genre-bender that has elements of Douglas Sirk, Oscar Wilde, Alfred Hitchcock and Joseph Kesselring.",Fresh
Cooper gives another indelible performance as a suffering innocent with devilish intent.,Fresh
"This contemplative examination of marriage, social mores, and personal ethics doesn't hold together, but individual pieces are absorbing enough to make up for the many uninspired moments, resulting in a mediocre, passable work.",Fresh
The movie is a goof on Hitchcock and Sirk -- a period (late forties) soap opera with nasty sexual undertones and the omnipresent threat of murder.,Fresh
"All over the place in tone, never knowing if it wants to be a relationship comedy, a serious drama or a Hitchcock murder thriller.",Rotten
Cooper and Brosnan display more genuine chemistry than anything that passes for sparks between Cooper and kept woman McAdams.,Rotten
"Stylish without being overly stylized, intelligent without being boring, Married Life is a classy throwback to the good old days when subtlety meant something at the movies and watching Hitchcock was a good reason to stay home.",Fresh
"[Pierce] Brosnan, by the way, should be happy to have left the bonds of being Bond if he continues picking roles this wisely.",Fresh

Sachs gets terrific performances out of his actors.,Fresh
Sachs avoids the casual misogyny that other filmmakers have brought to similar material.,Fresh
[The] four principal actors are such worthy vehicles for sustaining the throbbing pace and shifting moods of this chamber piece that it's difficult to single anyone out.,Fresh
Married Life is much more about the enduring relationship between husband and wife than it is about the excitement between husband and girlfriend.,Fresh
"From the very start, with Doris Day singing ""I Can't Give You Anything But Love,"" this is a captivating, atmospheric thriller with superb performances.",Fresh
Maybe there's nothing more to say and American cinema has finally exhausted its ragging on the most maligned decade of the 20th century.,Rotten
"Stuck somewhere between a dark comedy and a thriller, director Ira Sachs' Married Life doesn't really work as either, leaving its strong cast adrift.",Rotten
One of those little movies that really only exists on the radar because big names were in it.,Rotten
A playful riff on film noir that starts by upending every '40s movie clich√©.,Fresh
"Married Life, a period comedy of manners merged with a suspenseful psychological thriller, aspires to be a hybrid of the sort that Alfred Hitchcock polished to perfection.",Fresh
"It's an imitation of life, all right, but without much to say about it.",Rotten
"Rather than real emotion, the movie stops at irony...It's an entertaining approach, all right, but it does the material no real service.",Rotten
"Just when things should be boiling over, the script goes lukewarm.",Rotten
"This subtle dance around morality is as seductive as the elegantly designed rooms it takes place in, where even the shadows are cozy.",Fresh
"Maybe it is about compromise, after all, because though Married Life has its moments, it's bewildering as a whole.",Rotten
The cast is first-rate but nothing goes very far in this film.,Fresh
This is a period melodramatic potboiler that has an OK (though predictable) story arc and benefits from its exemplary cast and terrific attention to post-WW II New York detail in costume and set.,Rotten
"While I respect what Sachs is attempting to do, and while fleeting moments here and there kept me thoroughly enraptured, by the time it was over I found myself frustratingly disappointed almost beyond words.",Rotten
"There's gentile satire here, to go along with suspense and sexual intrigue, but the tone of the piece stays too melodramatic to hit its potential to resonate. Every actor pours on his or her best, in a tempered showcase movie that's worth seeing.",Fresh
"Married Life suffers from its indecision as to whether to be a sophisticated comedy or a heavy dramatic piece and ends up excelling at neither. It's a regrettable collection of bad choices, missed opportunities and a waste of a great cast.",Rotten
"Cooper and Clarkson are sublime in creating a marriage still filled with tenderness, even as they lie to each other with breezy consistency.",Fresh
"Director Ira Sachs plays it wistful not wayward, sticking to essential melodrama and tidy infidelities while dropping narrative cherry bombs for calculated effect.",Fresh
The multiple endings suggest that the filmmakers themselves never really knew what their movie was about.,Rotten
"[T]here is something off with the pacing. The big Hitchcockian suspense sequence toward the end feels like something from the middle of a movie; you expect one more twist, but none develops.",Rotten
Both romantic and subtly surprising ... you can think of it as a comedy-of-errors murder mystery as Hitchcock might have adapted Thackeray.,Fresh
"Quality actors can inflate standard material like a collagen injection, and great performances help ""Married Life"" expand beyond the typical double-crossing.",Fresh
It's only about as interesting as...married life.,Rotten
"It's strange. It's different. It's arresting, and it's definitely intentional. Ira Sachs knew what he wanted to do, and he's a talent worth watching.",Fresh
Sirk or Billy Wilder could have done something with it. Sachs still has a ways to go.,Rotten
"A macabre comedy of manners with the sting of dry ice, this 2007 ensemble piece captures the social climate of America in the late 40s.",Rotten
"Married Life is structured like a Douglas Sirk melodrama or a Hitchcock thriller rather than a mystery, but it's a mystery nonetheless, because it's rarely clear what Sachs intends the movie to be.",Rotten
"You may not like it if you insist on counting the deck after the game and coming up with 52. But if you get 51 and are amused by how the missing card was made to vanish, this may be a movie to your liking.",Fresh
"There is a lightness and whimsy from the animated opening credits to the bright and explicit glamour of its 1949 world. While the narrative doesn't exactly wink at the camera, it certainly doesn't wallow in what could have been very dark material.",Fresh
"Step back to the guilt and self recrimination of the 1940s film noir in a cozy nest of plotting, cyanide and the best friend's lover. Those subject to nostalgia will love this pot boiler every step of the way.",Fresh
"Sachs and Moverman have scripted a potboiler, but unwisely kept the lid on. Their intent is wry philosophical detachment; the effect is a biting social satire gone soggy.",Rotten
Asks the audience to spend a lot of time waiting for not much to happen.,Rotten
"Married Life has enough plot twists and moments of high tension to keep the viewer engaged, but the main points of interest are the characters.",Fresh
...keeps pussyfooting back and forth between asking us to become emotionally invested and playing itself as parody. A better movie could've done both.,Rotten
It's all quite deftly played with a maturity and introspection that may take you by surprise...,Fresh
"Married life has its ups and downs, and so does this movie. Unfortunately, more of the latter than the former.",Rotten
"[Director] Sachs has assembled a stellar ensemble cast, and much of the pleasure of Married Life is watching the subtle detail the actors bring to their roles.",Fresh
"If you can slow yourself down to the stately pace of 1950 (a whiskey sour or two might help), you might enjoy the offbeat Married Life.",Fresh
"Married Life is a sumptuously shot homage to the spirit of noir. It is enjoyably sour for its own sake and not dependent on a gruesome payoff (in fact, it sets up a few that pointedly don't come to pass).",Fresh
"A curious, provocative if unsatisfying little movie.",Rotten
It's strange how a movie with this many different things happening could be so dull.,Rotten
"Richard's version is exceptionally insidious, which makes Married Life at once fascinating and unsurprising.",Rotten
"This quiet, closed-in picture with its unsurprising twists and turns, lacks the steamy passion of its pulp roots.",Rotten
"The performances from this extraordinary cast are as sumptuous as you'd expect, but they disappear into a wisp of insignificance.",Rotten
"... with its superb cast, its literate screenplay ... and noteworthy direction, [Married Life] is that long overdue adult film we've been waiting for.",Fresh
"Married Life is an engaging romance noir, a sort of updated The Postman Always Rings Twice that packs its surprises into four characters, none of them predictable.",Fresh
"Ultimately, the movie takes its characters, and the absurd ethical dilemma it subjects them to, far too seriously.",Rotten
"It is a nicely executed, skillfully acted and atmospheric exercise in genre stage craft, but so dry and low-key that it is never really involving.",Rotten
"It oscillates between stale period piece and unengaging melodrama, coyly seducing viewers with the potential it fails to fulfill.",Rotten
"Married Life is genteel, well-mannered -- and boring.",Rotten
"Offers audiences movie pleasures, as well as emotionally authentic challenges.",Fresh
[Brosnan] provides an odd but appropriate balance of laid-back irony and old-fashioned sentimentality that makes Married Life as interesting as married life itself.,Fresh
"The acting is well-done and well-balanced, and Peter Deming's cinematography -- part golden, part somber -- suggests the dark side of postwar prosperity, which Americans had begun to contemplate by 1949.",Fresh
"Married Life reveals that playing pretend is not a game for children alone, but rather an artifice that finds its fullest expression in adulthood.",Fresh
"In many ways, Married Life is a Coen Brothers knock-off without a bit of the boys' accomplishment or bravado.",Rotten
"Married Life gives new meaning to the phrase, ""'til death do us part.""",Fresh
It's best to ignore these scenes from a marriage; stick with Ingmar Bergman instead.,Rotten
"A sly, pitch-black domestic manifesto that's scabrous enough to suggest that if you design your own cage, you'll forget that you're trapped.",Fresh
"It's as dry as the martinis these well-dressed stiffs keep ordering at that perfectly preserved oak, leather and velvet bar before hopping into their vintage convertibles.",Rotten
Never says much about the marital institution that is fresh.,Fresh
"Dramatizes the notion that a person's 'burden of conscience' is not an innate reality but a malleable construct, motivated by narcissism.",Fresh
"Sachs combines humor, suspense, and twists of plot that keep the ground shifting under our feet.",Fresh
"Agreeable, nicely adult entertainment that's satisfying without ever being exciting.",Fresh
"I suspect Hitchcock would enjoy watching this slow-churning thriller, which pilfers a few of the master's storytelling tricks as it revels in its own dark heart.",Fresh
"One of the dullest, most thoroughly pointless motion pictures ever made.",Rotten
"It's elegant, unhurried, and, if you meet it half way, softly satisfying ... like the muffled clap of a velvet-covered ring box snapping shut.",Fresh
"All in all, this was a fun little, old fashioned pot boiler.",Fresh
"It swings from Far From Heaven-alike lush melodrama to Double Indemnity-like noir to something approaching black comedy, and the transitions never quite work. Accomplished then, but no classic.",Fresh
"An ode to Hollywood movies of the 40s and 50s, with its rich story, its post-war middle class mores of US society, its production design and its characters blundering around a moral dilemma.",Fresh
"A mannered comedy of manners that, in its eagerness to be all things to all people, ends up being nothing much of anything.",Rotten
"It looks beautiful, and the convoluted plotting is initially the right side of Hitchcock pastiche, but the central conundrum is teased out over so many twists and false climaxes that ultimately it's a shrug, not a shock, which greets the denouement.",Fresh
"Superbly directed, thought-provoking blend of Hitchcock movies, 1940s pastiche and Bette Davis-style melodrama, featuring terrific performances from Cooper and Clarkson.",Fresh
"Thought-provoking themes swirl around in this drama, brought to life by a skilled cast and a director who plays with Hitchcockian themes and imagery. In the end, it feels a bit undercooked, but the actors keep us glued to the screen.",Fresh
"It's a good cast, with Cooper outstanding, but Sachs's direction is stodgy and the screenplay is grindingly self-conscious.",Rotten
"The acting is as classy and well-realised as the lush 1940s period detail, yet this entertainingly entangled, ersatz noir is frustrating because it never fully gels.",Fresh
"The tangled web which slowly causes the film's relationships to disintegrate is brilliantly woven. However, you can't help wishing the climax packs a bit more of a dramatic punch.",Fresh
"A noirish 1940s-set character study, it's an initially intriguing tale of infidelity and betrayal that smoulders, but never quite catches fire.",Rotten
A classy cast and production design to die for are the only features of note in an underpowered tale of adultery and intrigue in '50s America.,Rotten
"Married Life may fall short of the best Hollywood melodrama, but its nicely observed situations and old-fashioned storytelling ironically lend this a freshness more on-the-nose infidelity tales are missing.",Rotten
"The movie is determinedly low-key, but honest, with a wrenching break-up scene, sharp work from Clarkson, and a final thought that lingers, about never really knowing what your other half is thinking.",Fresh
"A well-acted but lugubrious noir, which is somehow not quite thrilling enough to be a thriller, and not quite profound enough to be a character study.",Fresh
"The layers of deception are as meticulously constructed as the impeccable 1940s production and costume design. Unfortunately, the film doesn't maintain that distinctive noir cruelty, as hard as red lacquered finger nails.",Fresh
"Once he gets out from under his influences and trusts his own gut, Sachs might become a major director.",Fresh
"The ensemble cast chemistry is superb in its nearly suffocating tangle of repressed passions, but the family-values wrap-up of all these messy erotic tensions feels ultimately far too pat and unresolved.",Fresh
Even movies that dare to paint dark portraits of the sacred institution can't resist glorifying it in the end.,Rotten
One of the more ethically dubious films to come out of Hollywood in years.,Fresh
"This darkly comic dramatic thriller, which is set just after World War II, is more than merely watchable. It's very smart and is old-fashioned in several respects.",Fresh
"It is as though filmmaker Ira Sachs fears that just making a film about infidelity is too straight, too pedestrian, so, he's got to introduce the possibility that murder is on the horizon.",Rotten
"The roundelay structure and Hitchcockian nods could have easily given way to a sardonic puppet theater, but Sachs and screenwriter Oren Moverman care too much about their characters to turn them into pawns",Fresh
"The United States' well-off middle class of the 1950s, its taboos, stereotypes and lifestyles, are reflected in this interesting and harsh film. [Full review in Spanish]",Fresh
"Failing to orient itself in any way, it becomes a vacuum, a rote recitation of the mechanics of the murder plot.",Rotten
Badland practically begs 'For Your Consideration' without the substance to justify its awards-season epic length.,Rotten
"At least half the celluloid should have hit the editing room floor, since this one-trick road flick revolves around Jerry's constantly contemplating suicide and belatedly bonding with his daughter while eluding the authorities.",Rotten
"Clocking in at just under three hours, writer-director Francesco Lucente's earnest attempt at making an Iraq War-era Coming Home says many things at once without much perspective or clarity.",Rotten
The mawkish yet weirdly mesmerizing film Badland is independent in scale but aggressively Hollywood in storytelling.,Fresh
"The year's dullest movie has arrived: the deeply silly Badland, which is as dead as winter and twice as long.",Rotten
Possibly the worst idea for a movie this century.,Rotten
"Expertly constructed and beautifully photographed, Badland easily sustains its 160-minute running time, and the portrayals of Draven, a British actor, and 9-year-old Fulton can stand alongside the year's best.",Fresh
"Offensive to all and on every level, Badland tops the landfill of this year's worst.",Rotten
"The raw material would seem to be in place for a strong, moving contemporary tragedy, but scene after endless scene fails to come to life.",Rotten
"When the picture gets around to its calculated socko ending, the viewer has long been pummeled into a state of numbness.",Rotten
"Until the mess in the Middle East has found its way to a resolution, we can continue to expect films like Badland as part of the collateral damage in the War on Terror.",Rotten
Badland takes a step in the right direction by attempting to understand the aftermath of war.,Fresh
"Some good performances. But, the overall disturbing atmosphere of the film is more than I prefer. That said, I appreciate the effort to raise awareness of PTSD.",Rotten
"Exploiting what it is supposed to renounce, Badland combines a dreadfully long and dull screenplay and extremely plain surroundings to make a well-meaning anti-war film you'll want to miss.",Rotten
An unrelentingly bleak and depressing drama about an Iraqi war veteran who is unable to deal with his rage.,Rotten
Badland is a good 30-45 minutes too long.,Rotten
"Not so terrible that you can understand why it's been practically buried by its distributors, but you can get better ridiculous whodunits on TV.",Rotten
The murders are simply chalk marks on a blackboard with no build-up and little fallout.,Rotten
"Disappointing, badly plotted thriller, let down by some dodgy acting, poor direction and a script that makes The Da Vinci Code look like a masterpiece.",Rotten
A polished but verbose whodunit that's surprisingly buttoned-down given helmer Alex de la Inglesia's rep for comicbook wackiness.,Rotten
"A wonderfully compelling mess of a movie. It's tricky trying to bond Hitchcockian flair with lecture hall semantics, but the director works his tricks with ace visual consideration.",Fresh
"So bad it's good, then? Alas, the whole thing is uncomfortable and boring, scotching any ironic enjoyment of its awfulness.",Rotten
"The Scooby Doo ending requires nearly ten minutes of explanation and negates the need to follow the previous 90 minutes. It's also preceded by one character stating, ""In life, nobody bothers explaining anything."" Well, except in this movie.",Rotten
"A math- and symbology-tinged thriller adapted by director √Ålex de la Iglesia, and pitched at a breakneck, didactic clip, absent any sensible, modulated emotional investment in the characters or material.",Rotten
A poorly formulated story that's nearly impossible to understand and accept.,Rotten
"Hurt sells the silliness almost convincingly, but even from such a skillful pitchman it comes out sounding, finally, like junk.",Rotten
This purported whodunit thriller never solves its main mystery: How and why did this film get made in the first place?,Rotten
"The villain may be Untraceable, but it's easy to pin down the influences of Gregory Hoblit's serial killer snoozer.",Rotten
"This taut, savvy cyber-thriller makes for one of the better net flicks.",Fresh
Untraceable is a satisfying slice of solidly crafted meat-and-potatoes filmmaking.,Fresh
"What begins as an interesting techno thriller about the Internet dangerous effects escalates into a generic serial killer horror, ending on a false, preposterous note that negates interesting issues such as the public's insatiable need for sensationalism",Rotten
2008 gets its first installment of torture porn with a predictable thriller that blames a bloodthirsty public and big media for fostering an atmosphere of retribution violence.,Rotten
"Untraceable engenders a reaction that is one part fascination, one part disappointment, and two parts frustration.",Rotten
"Untraceable hasn't the brains of a class-act psychothriller like Silence of the Lambs, and lacks the balls to juice up the trashy verve of the Saw series. Stuck in the middle, it leaves everyone stranded, actors and audience alike.",Rotten
"This tepid, borderline offensive cyber-serial killer thriller takes what feels like ages to rehash both better and worse examples of the current, vapid clamor for so-called 'torture porn.'",Rotten
"Untraceable is one of those deplorably gratuitous movies that wants to have it both ways, but gets nothing right.",Rotten
Talk about your pious frauds. I've got a better way to show your disgust for Internet scum: Don't see Untraceable.,Rotten
"Untraceable has flaws, but this cat-and-mouse team is so hypnotic that all you do is sit there waiting while they deliver one big shock after another.",Fresh
Police procedural meets torture porn...sleazy and absurd rather than clever and surprising.,Rotten
"It's a tame version of Saw, aimed at middle-aged America, with the same lack of brains and appeal.",Rotten
"Seriously, I don't have time for this. In point of fact, neither should audiences. This movie is a piece of recycled garbage and is a waste Lane's, and pretty much everyone else's in the cast, talents.",Rotten
Even director Gregory Hoblit couldn't transform Untraceable from a mediocre horror movie into a compelling thriller.,Rotten
"In a genre that's already died a thousand mediocre movie deaths, Untraceable is not the last stab into its heart of darkness. Instead, it's the cinematic equivalent of a blueprint...",Rotten
"The original working title of this flick was Streaming Evil, which has precisely the right amount of built-in schlock for the tedious bit of horror exploitation this is.",Rotten
'Untraceable' is a thriller about computers that was probably written by one.,Rotten
More concerned about coming up with graphic death scenes than anything else.,Rotten
"While certain aspects are comparable to great suspense films like Seven and The Vanishing, the underlying ethical lessons in the film pluck the thrill out of the thriller. What's left is a preachy and predictable paradox.",Rotten
"It appears to have been designed to appeal only to those who will sit through even the most ploddingly paced and gruesomely icky police procedurals,have an unyielding fondness for Diane Lane and who have never once touched a computer in their lives",Rotten
a well-worn piece of formula produced with just enough professionalism to make it clear that those who made it should have known better,Rotten
"A great idea for a horror movie, Untraceable taps directly into the consciousness of America today... yet its execution is rushed.",Rotten
"Just as you are starting to think, 'Hey, this isn't so bad,' Untraceable takes a dive off the cliff even the Russian judge will give a perfect score to",Rotten
"With no suspense, no surprises and no rush, it's just soft core torture porn.",Rotten
"Over and over again, Hoblit misses opportunities to make an engaging picture, instead giving us a merely pedestrian one.",Rotten
Sets the tone with an opening suite of scenes that put a kitty in danger.,Rotten
"Some day, a thought-out cyberkiller movie is bound to come along. Wait, for 'Untraceable'is not it.",Rotten
Too bad the movie is put together by the numbers instead of being character-driven.,Rotten
Just ugh.,Rotten
Not even [Diane] Lane's solid performance can salvage a disappointing finale.,Rotten
"Lane skillfully sells the tech-heavy script. But after a much-too-early reveal of the murderer's identity, the 'low battery' signal starts to flash on this film by thriller specialist Gregory Hoblit.",Fresh
By now the hypocrisy of simultaneously condemning and exploiting the audience's sadism has become so commonplace in American movies it hardly seems noteworthy.,Rotten
"The au-courant, set-piece heavy script is skilled enough and the characterization are competent, but still Untraceable feels hollow.",Rotten
Suspense remains at a minimum.,Rotten
A run-of-the-mill thriller that lacks the substance to be anything more than forgettable.,Rotten
"In addition to being dull, Untraceable is a monster hypocrite, wagging its finger at the mass audience's appetite for strictly regimented, 'creative' torture scenarios. This film is not really in a position to point a finger.",Rotten
"A serviceable, hypocritical thriller that would have been an utter bore-fest if not for Diane Lane.",Rotten
"Assumes that the country is full of perverted, bloodthirsty sketchballs without actually wondering who these people are.",Rotten
"Untraceable wants us to deplore the amoral voyeurism of the cyberspace mobs, yet feeds off it at the same time.",Rotten
"As Untraceable descends into the progressively more perverted territory, it begins to practice the very hypocrisy it condemns in its audience, engaging in the rancid voyeurism it pretends to abhor.",Rotten
Torture porn for housewives.,Rotten
"There's a good movie to be made about the power of the virtual mob, the ethical consequences of participating in it, the costs of free will. But Untraceable isn't it, not by a long shot.",Rotten
"Life is too short for long-term exposure to relentless agony and distress, even in the guise of entertainment.",Rotten
"Wow, can that Diane Lane work a wireless mouse. And she typed that Control ALT Delete with such authority! Oh, my -- what was that? -- she minimized a window and activated a program with a hot key!",Rotten
"When Lane isn't preaching about the heinous violence, she's babbling on in tech speak. It's like having a Dell rep describe the plot of Saw.",Rotten
A blatantly derivative serial killer thriller that proceeds to tick off every single clich√© of the genre ... has nothing to offer beyond what we've already seen before.,Rotten
"Untraceable may not rank as one of the best serial-killer thrillers of all time, but it packs enough punch to hold your attention way past the whodunit point.",Fresh
"...the picture is grimly unpleasant, and the formulaic conclusion subverts whatever earnest intentions were present at the beginning.",Rotten
"Morally duplicitous torture porn: how else to describe Untraceable, a bleak, rain-washed horror thriller.",Rotten
"This joyless thriller runs the gamut from unconscionable through unwatchable to unendurable. It's also unfathomable that two talented people, Diane Lane and her director, Gregory Hoblit, got themselves involved in such an unpromising enterprise.",Rotten
Untraceable feels sleazy and gratuitous.,Rotten
"In case you didn't catch it, the moral is that each time we indulge our inner voyeur by visiting macabre websites or tuning into salacious tabloid news, we're implicated in the larger cultural crime.",Rotten
"Untraceable demonstrates, once again, how unnecessary it is for audiences actually to understand technical jargon.",Rotten
Untraceable really is disgraceable.,Rotten
"As plain awful as Untraceable is, possibly the worst thing about it is that it pretends to mean something.",Rotten
"It can't have been easy for hundreds of actors, technicians and stunt people to show up for work every day to make a movie whose message is, essentially: Don't go see this movie.",Rotten
"Untraceable isn't unwatchable, but it's a pretty miserable experience, from a director who knows better.",Rotten
"Untraceable often seems to go out of its way to tip off what's coming, so that it's hard to tell whether the film's writers are lazy, clumsy or just painfully obvious.",Rotten
"Hateful, brutalizing, inexcusable.",Rotten
"Technology is the film's only hook. Otherwise, it's a standard B-movie thriller featuring basement torture chambers and an FBI agent-single mom who tracks a killer before becoming a target herself.",Rotten
You can call this movie Untraceable but you can't call it Unpredictable.,Rotten
"From its obvious foreshadowing to Marsh's big PowerPoint presentation of the killer's cause-and-effect, Untraceable is a mite too traceable to get under the skin.",Rotten
"Untraceable is also relentlessly grim and dull, and runs afoul of all the pitfalls you find in movies in which people rely on computers to do their detecting.",Rotten
"The movie chides us for being a sick voyeuristic society, hungry for the sight of violence. The purity of this moral stance is somewhat clouded by the movie's habit of staging sick violent acts.",Rotten
Untraceable essentially forces its audience to identify with those who would be willing accomplices to torture and murder.,Rotten
A diverting police procedural.,Fresh
"The agony of Untraceable is as predictable as a computer program, and about as inhuman.",Rotten
"Untraceable mostly delivers the chills, despite its conventionalities.",Fresh
A competent but unremarkable crime thriller.,Rotten
"This serial killer mystery has a good cast and a reasonable story and it could have been solid, but the plot thickens via acts of such abject stupidity that the movie is eventually ruined.",Rotten
The film delivers a tight cat-and-mouse thriller sullied by or seasoned with (depending on one's taste for such things) elaborate acts of torture.,Fresh
"The film teases and unnerves for 100 minutes with scenes of cold brutality. Then in a rush to the end, it tries to make it all better, or at least make it more complicated.",Rotten
This well-made thriller's ending almost makes up for what goes before.,Fresh
"Hoblit and veteran cinematographer Anastas Michos try to darken the proceedings by giving us nocturnal characters and Portland at its grayest. But it's window dressing, just like the layers of computer geek-speak that can't disguise an analog-age plot.",Rotten
Untraceable lambastes us for being amoral voyeurs as it panders to our baser instincts at the same time.,Rotten
"An abhorrent cyberthriller starring a compelling Diane Lane, the film exploits the inhumanity of torture as it cynically condemns Internet rubberneckers (and by extension, moviegoers) for watching it online.",Rotten
The makers of Untraceable don't have that high an opinion of you.,Rotten
"Untraceable is a horrifying thriller, smart and tightly told, and merciless.",Fresh
"That's right, Hollywood has finally made a film centered on agony that even a grandmother could love.",Rotten
Untraceable's knee-jerk moralizing is reprehensible and stupid.,Rotten
What amounts to being a solid thriller collapses into an absurd potboiler as though the scriptwriters ran out of ideas.,Rotten
"If I can forgive Lane for dating uber-douchebag Jon Bon Jovi, marrying Christopher Highlander 2 Lambert, and making Must Love Dogs, I can forgive her this.",Rotten
"While Untraceable is an amiable enough way to kill two hours, it never gels into the kind of movie that would make me run out and start endorsing it to others.",Rotten
"Is it really ethical for a film to warn of the irresistible appeal of online snuff films while it simultaneously indulges, practically pornographically, in graphic displays of the same sort of kinky perversion?",Rotten
"Boring, hypocritical, and didactic, Untraceable is an exercise in tut-tutting the audience for being curious about the very stuff the film traffics in.",Rotten
"Untraceable could have been a much more interesting film if it had simply stayed closer to its wonkish, Internet-flavored thriller roots.",Rotten
Just a bland crime movie that puts too much faith in an overbaked concept.,Rotten
"Geeky, gruesome and repugnant.",Rotten
"Imagine Hostel with a CSI twist and done for the Oxygen network crowd, and you'll have an idea of what Untraceable is like.",Rotten
The movie equivalent of a clueless old person ranting about the Internet.,Rotten
"Courageous Diane Lane plays a real woman without soft lighting, makeup, a hairdresser, or fancy clothes.",Fresh
Untraceable is a movie whose potential was tossed aside for the conventional trappings of the serial-killer genre.,Rotten
Untraceable? You'll only wish it was.,Rotten
"""Untraceable"" certainly isn't unwatchable, but it is a bit unbelievable, rather predictable and more than a little bit gruesome (-able?)",Rotten
"Untraceable? Unappetizing is more like it - or perhaps unrealistic, unconvincing and/or unexciting.",Rotten
I wouldn't spend my hard earned money on something that insults my intelligence this much.,Rotten
Takes the two most cliched types of serial killer movie and tries to fuse them together to create a spark of something original - it doesn't work,Rotten

[T]he makers of Untraceable have come up with an effective solution to the problem of Internet piracy: Make films that nobody would want to pirate.,Rotten
"Here's an interesting concept that could have been so much more. And its de-volution isn't ""Untraceable"" %u2013 you can watch it dissolve after the solid setup.",Rotten
"While it would be unfair to say there aren't moments of reasonable suspense, playing off our natural aversion to people being tortured does not constitute good filmmaking.",Rotten
Exploits the very trend it condemns.,Rotten
"a... po-faced affair, pretending to be above all the sensationalism and depravity that it exploits, as though Hoblit and co. are somehow themselves immune from their killer's obsession with viewing figures.",Rotten
Feels as if it's been patched together using 'auto-fill' screenwriting software.,Rotten
"""It's a jungle in there!"" sighs Hanks as he counts the millions visiting the movie's kill-view website. But for all its scaremongering, Untraceable is best viewed as an above-average thriller with a tech-savvy hook.",Fresh

You know something ain't kosher when a movie purporting to offer a critique of sadistic voyeurism opens with a hand-rubbing scene of kitten abuse.,Rotten
Untraceable is nothing more than a paint-by-numbers suspense thriller undeserving of your mental bandwidth.,Rotten
"A competent suspenser, helped by the always-dependable Diane Lane, but it suffers by following the modern thriller playbook to the letter.",Rotten
"Even though this film strains to be another Silence of the Lambs (tormented heroine chases nasty killer), it's still oddly involving.",Rotten
"Enjoyable thriller, enlivened by a decent script, impressive direction and strong performances from Diane Lane and Colin Hanks.",Fresh
"Lane is an imaginative actress, every bit as good as Jodie Foster, and the film is clothed in a dark and chilly atmosphere that Hoblit constructs with some skill.",Fresh
"Some viewers might find the Hostel-style splatter hard to stomach while, for a smart cop, Lane sure does some dumb things.",Rotten
"The problem with Hollywood films condemning the public appetite for torture is that they frequently pander to it, and this is a very lurid and unsavoury example.",Rotten
"Very unpleasant, though skilfully put together by director Gregory Hoblit and acted with beyond-the-call empathy by Ms Lane.",Rotten
"This new variation on the theme isn't bad, in a gruesome and horrible way, and features a strong performance from Diane Lane as an FBI agent.",Fresh
"On the surface the film is a solid thriller, but there's more thought here than in the average serial killer flick.",Fresh
"Very enjoyable as a 'race against time' thriller and Lane is great as the weary but determined lead. It's just a shame that Untraceable's message is delivered in such a ham-fisted, hypocritical way.",Rotten
"In keeping with the title, this Silence Of The Lambs wannabe contains not a trace of originality, but should appeal to those who like their thrillers with a side order of gore.",Fresh
"Even if you take the film's moral lesson at face value, the overkill is discouraging, and not very instructive.",Rotten
What is ultimately more disturbing than the premise itself is the way director Gregory Hoblit injects a sensational voyeuristic element to the proceedings. I felt as though I needed a good wash after watching.,Rotten
[T]he honkingly stupid script is the kind that inspires Mystery Science Theater call-and-response.,Rotten
"Creepy, suspenseful cyber-thriller about downloading death, hacker homicide, and a baby-faced computer geek wielding a mouse as a deadly weapon.",Fresh
"Part of the problem with ""Untraceable"" is the identity of the killer behind the Web site is revealed way too early, thus taking most of the mystery out of the movie.",Rotten
The movie's run of the mill stuff - fairly entertaining but not particularly inventive - with the standard twists and turns. Yet another film featuring a cute but horrific serial killer fixated on a beautiful and intelligent female law officer.,Rotten
"Neither terrible nor memorable, Untraceable is the sort of movie that lives up to its name %u2013 within an hour of seeing it, memories of it will vanish without a trace.",Rotten
"...a generic, garden-variety thriller that's almost entirely lacking in genuine thrills or surprises...",Fresh
Untraceable will have steam for a little while and then it is just going to die down and become the $5.99 movie at Walmart.,Rotten

Neither terrifying nor inspiring.,Rotten
"While certainly compelling in terms of drawing you into the story, Untraceable has a number of nagging narrative flaws.",Rotten
Cookie cutter police procedural with a Hostel tinge.,Rotten
"Untraceable is prototype Internet conspiracy drivel, with a hackneyed plot years too late and a simple premise of good cops and innocents against sickos.",Rotten
"Untraceable boasts a respected director (Gregory Hoblit of Fracture and Primal Fear), and a popular movie star (Diane Lane) but it's still about people getting tortured to death.",Rotten
Untraceable is a thriller with a heavy moral compass which shines a bright light on internet ethics.,Fresh
"For all the would-be with-it cyber/techno-speak, strip that all away, and Gregory Hoblit's film is completely stale and cliched thriller nonsense.",Rotten
"We, the real-life audience, are as sick as the movie's fictional viral audience if we reward the studio behind Untraceable with our dollars.",Rotten
"Open endings work for some movies, but a story this depressing needs some resolution.",Rotten
"Characters become real enough to draw you in, yet are not deeply drawn enough to make you care.",Rotten
"People sometimes had ordinary, reasonably polite conversations, even in the '80s. Not absolutely all the talking was affectless mumbling, angry recriminations, drug deals or TV news about Ronald Reagan.",Rotten
"An ugly, blank slate of a film, one that feels like a rough outline for one of the better Ellis adaptations.",Rotten
Perhaps the only use this film has is to give philosophers who sit through it some way of experiencing what eternity truly means.,Rotten
"Gregor Jordan and Bret Easton Ellis take no prisoners in this uncompromising, expertly crafted shocker about hedonism in early-'80s L.A.",Fresh
"Sublimely awful, director Gregor Jordan's adaptation of Bret Easton Ellis' dystopic vision of '80s era Los Angeles bounces between a slew of unlikable reckless characters.",Rotten

"The Informers is the kind of movie that, upon leaving the theater, provokes the urge to take a shower.",Rotten
"Occasionally, some fool gets the idea that his literary wretched excess would make for a good film.",Rotten
"There's plenty of incident, but not much plot. As befits a tale of absolute self-absorption and unconscious revelation, The Informers often seems to be telling on itself.",Rotten
"A rancid load of swill called The Informers, from a depraved 1994 book by Bret Easton Ellis, is, like The Soloist, a look at the underbelly of L.A., but the resemblance ends there.",Rotten
I don't find The Informers to be without interest -- unlike most critics -- but neither do I find it successful enough to recommend it.,Rotten
The Informers delivers a muddled message.,Rotten
Do some blow. Curse humanity. Convert to nilhilism. Reread American Psycho. But don't for the love of God and cinema see The Informers.,Rotten
"It's a movie with Altmanesque pretensions, but under Gregor Jordan's flat-line direction amounts to flipping through an out-of-date fashion magazine, one that barely spurs the energy to point and laugh.",Rotten
"This sprawling, wanna-be Short Cuts tale is so over-the-top and so insufferably unpleasant that it makes even his infamous ""American Psycho"" seem tame by comparison.",Rotten
"Ellis, director Gregor Jordan and a cast that's hollow but only occasionally empty, manage to anticipate excess' hangover, a headache we've become intimately familiar with -- all over again.",Fresh
In the buff naughty boobs 'n buns bad parenting sex and drug addiction romp. And a weird cry for help cinema probing wasted LA youth without adult supervision in sight. Though with sly hints on where all those hallucinatory Hollywood plots arise.,Fresh
"Ellis' book, though a grim read, had a satirical edge to it that made it darkly enjoyable; the movie is simply dark and dull. And vampireless, more's the pity.",Rotten
"The piece had better have something fresh to say. The Informers doesn't, nor does it seem to want to.",Rotten
"There's no real structure to Jordan's film, so stories haphazardly begin and disappear without ending",Rotten
"A nihilistic, narcissistic, knuckleheaded move about nihilistic, narcissistic knuckleheads, The Informers might have been an interesting exercise in satire, if it only had a sense of humor. Which it doesn't.",Rotten
The dialogue is laughable. Lines are spoken so languidly that the actors seem bored. Shattering revelations are delivered in the same monotone as casual patter.,Rotten
"The Informers should be more aware of its own unsavoryness, and revel in it a little. As it is, the movie is far too weighty, as though it were honestly trying to convey some kind of cautionary message.",Rotten
Excels in the mysterious tension found when someone who doesn't care talks to someone who does.,Fresh
"The result turns the novel's cynical satire into a facile morality play, in which these privileged children want to be told the difference between right and wrong.",Rotten
"Perhaps the film's biggest mistake is that after more than an hour of proving how pointless and vapid these characters are, it leaves us with a parting shot indicating we should care about what happens to them. We don't.",Rotten
"An outbreak of '80s nostalgia is the best explanation for The Informers, a worse movie based on a worse Bret Easton Ellis book.",Rotten
"If The Informers doesn't sound to you like a pleasant time at the movies, you are right.",Rotten
"In spite of the title, The Informers doesn't get below the surface of the era of Reaganesque excess to tell us anything new. But it's way cool to look at.",Rotten
"The Informers is a beautiful picture of misery, but the surface quality is never penetrated to satisfaction. In the end, it's a mess of smeary mascara, mix tapes, and hair mousse in search of connective tissue.",Rotten
"If you don't require anything more profound... in your movies, then The Informers may well be a satisfying experience.",Fresh
"Aesthetically pretty, subjectively ugly, and emotionally incisive, the picture celebrates the passing of a not-so-innocent era and mourns the victims left in its wake.",Fresh
"It's by far the most slack, ho-hum movie ever made from Ellis' material.",Rotten
It's actually pretty funny if you don't feel the need to care for or sympathize with anybody onscreen.,Fresh
The Informers is a movie so seamy it makes you want to take a bath afterward. Rarely has so much sin seemed so boring.,Rotten
Ellis doesn't create a single authentic moment or sympathetic character in this lurid pastiche of disconnected vignettes.,Rotten
"This one's a certifiable soul-sucker, dining out on its characters' venalities while wagging a finger at the horror, the horror.",Rotten
Gregor Jordan's pointless adaptation of a Bret Easton Ellis book is successful only in the sense that it accurately mimics the emptiness of its subject.,Rotten
It's almost a relief when one of the characters comes down with a deadly disease.,Rotten
Repulsive 80s flashback.,Rotten
"The film is as flat as the Hollywood sign, with beautiful young people, all blonde, mostly naked, trying desperately to get up the energy to order something else from room service.",Rotten
"A grim, open-ended study in smooth surfaces, skin and 25-year-old pop-culture references.",Rotten
"There seems to be no point to this derivative Bret Easton Ellis retro-wallow. It's all sex, drugs, rock 'n roll and boredom - with the emphasis on boredom.",Rotten
"The performances run the gamut from twitchy to catatonic, and the stoned stiffness of the actors seems to have less to do with the affectlessness of the characters than with their own confusion.",Rotten
The Informers is such a wretched piece of garbage that there's a certain amount of guilt attached to even writing about it.,Rotten
Ellis's big notions are less insightful than they pretend to be.,Rotten
"Though name actors and the involvement of a cult author may eventually get The Informers attention, there's nobody who loves the '80s enough to knowingly pay good money to suffer through all 98 minutes of this.",Rotten
"Has an air of detachment and sadness, enhanced by the movie's being set a full quarter century ago. Like new cars in an old movie, these people may glow with youth, but we watch them in full awareness of the beaters and wrecks they'll become.",Fresh
The movie has more dead scenes than a Monday night in Magnitogorsk.,Rotten
An awful film about an awful time.,Fresh
Is there an easier target for satire than Hollywood? Or a duller one?,Rotten
"Just because your characters are vacuous, less-than-zero types, it doesn't necessarily mean that the tone and structure of your movie has to adopt the same conditions.",Rotten
An aimless mess. But at least the mess is sexy and exciting.,Rotten
"Remember the '80s? After sitting through The Informers you may wanna burn your Rubik's Cube and ""Where's the Beef"" T-shirt.",Rotten
"The Informers is grimy, nasty and graphic in its depictions of excess, and those are its good points.",Rotten
This is nothing more than Short Cuts with shortcuts,Rotten
I wish they'd kept the vampire. I wish they'd given him a rocket launcher.,Rotten
Parental Content Review,Rotten
"It's haute trash, faux Crash, a series of interlocking plotlines which are meant to convince the viewer that something more profound is taking place. It isn't.",Rotten
"Despite a terrific ensemble cast, The Informers suffers from an uneven, chaotic screenplay with forgettable, poorly developed characters while none of the actors or actresses get a chance to shine. It never really gels into a sharp, compelling or e",Rotten
"Brazenly befouling cinemas with its sub-soap-opera acting, melodramatic dialogue, and thoroughly unlikable characters.",Rotten
This just felt like a bunch of people in 1980s L.A. with blonde streaks in their hair listening to Wang Chung.,Rotten
Gorgeous people and some well written dialogue aren't enough to make this a movie you should see.,Rotten
The Informers becomes that rare movie that is so tedious it dares you to keep watching.,Rotten
Filled with narcissistic twits who never say or do anything of consequence or interest.,Rotten
Life is a bitch and then you go to L.A.,Rotten
"Imagine ""Crash"" with a social disease and you pretty much have ""The Informers"" in a nutshell.",Rotten
"...a dreary, loosely connected parade of drug-, drink- and sex-sodden lost souls.",Rotten
"A chilling, brutal film that is a lot more than the sum of its one dimensional parts would suggest.",Fresh
"What an A-list cast: Mickey Rourke, Winona Ryder and Kim Basinger. Interesting enough, all stars of the eighties, which is exactly where this movie should have stayed.",Rotten
"Imagine Absolutely Fabulous without Edina and Patsy, or Dynasty without Alexis, and what have you got? The Informers.",Rotten
"We may not care about these cokeheads, but only rarely does Jordan fall into knee-jerk retribution.",Fresh
"A lurid, soapy, moralistic melodrama so mucky you'll need a shower.",Rotten
"Directed by Gregor Jordan, Ellis's aimlessly dissolute collection of stories just doesn't hang together as a coherent whole.",Rotten
"There is a weird, almost comic absence of insight and perspective here. But it is a joke without humour and without a punchline.",Rotten
"This self-penned adaptation of his 1994 short story collection - a period piece set in 1983 Los Angeles - has supposedly been cut to ribbons, and it shows.",Rotten
Jordan gives all this an entirely appropriate sheen and the cast play well through glazed eyes. The film will fascinate those who love to see the tormented lives of those who seem luckier than the rest of us.,Fresh
"Failing to work on so many levels, The Informers operates as a time capsule of 1983 and a time when substance was negated in favour of style. Sadly, this movie is severely lacking in both of those departments.",Rotten
For diehard Ellis completists only.,Rotten
"It's an empty shell entertaining a nasty streak of misogyny, a single note ensemble piece that's very much less than zero.",Rotten
"This film is bad - really, really bad.",Rotten
A star-studded mess.,Rotten
"Bret Easton Ellis pens a mean tale, in all adjectival senses. His prose is artfully maleficent; he is a laid-back Severus Snape of the sex-and-drugs generation. You need a smarter directing hand, though, than Gregor Jordan's.",Rotten
"Director Gregor Jordan seems to have gone into reverse since his 2001 Buffalo Soldiers, aiming for the LA rondeau of Altman's Short Cuts but missing all the vital ingredients - wit, humanity, charm, nuance and meaning.",Rotten
"The film has a slick surface sheen and evocative soundtrack (Simple Minds, A Flock Of Seagulls, etc) but those are just incidental pleasures in a languid condemnation of soulless excess.",Rotten
"The Informers isn't dull but the characters are hollow and the dialogue stilted. In the hands of the film's less experienced actors, it verges on the embarrassing.",Rotten
None of the characters are particularly appealing and it ultimately fails to engage on an emotional level.,Rotten
"Watching people live such vacuous, clone-like lives of privilege and decadence, it's impossible to feel anything for them.",Rotten
The Informers proves once again that Ellis's stories are difficult to realise for the big screen and perhaps best left for the printed page and the imagination.,Rotten
"Much of it remains purposefully pointless, and Ellis and Jordan never attempt to reframe the dead-eyed hedonism and solipsism that makes these characters very hard to care about.",Rotten
"It has a good cast and a terrific 1980s soundtrack (Devo, Simple Minds), but it also has the superficiality of a TV soap. The Informers is not so bad that you can't sit back and enjoy it, but nor is it good enough to go and see.",Rotten
"In structure and location the film resembles Robert Altman's Short Cuts, though it's much inferior and far less interesting.",Rotten
While it's an occasionally unsettling piece - and comes with a big-name cast - the story never goes anywhere.,Rotten
"bleak, boring and bloated.",Rotten
...a ninety-eight-minute snooze-fest.,Rotten
"Imagine American Psycho with less violence but more nudity, transplanted from New York to California and stripped of all self-awareness. That's The Informers.",Rotten
"Rating less than zero on the sophistication scale, The Informers is thus a totally faithful adaptation of Bret Easton Ellis' novel--and an accurate look at early '80s-era Los Angeles.",Fresh
"Brad Renfro in his last movie role, playing a wannabe film actor who sprays out filthy perspiration like a collie emerging from a sewer. It's possible this role killed Renfro.",Rotten
Heaven protect us from any more Bret Easton Ellis versions of Tales of the Empty Lives of Los Angeles.,Rotten
It was a series of randomness that don't really offer much information or contribute to the overall point.,Rotten
The film manages to capture the palpable frustration on the ground.,Fresh
"As in Land Without Bread and The Bridge, Meeting Resistance raises all sorts of ethical questions about its making.",Fresh
"I think it is time for us to take a film like Meeting Resistance very seriously indeed, and to ponder its message very carefully, despite my abiding doubts about its ultimate reliability as a guide to our actions.",Fresh
"Filmed during the first year of the U.S. occupation of Iraq, Meeting Resistance suffers from the same problem as the Iraq-set feature film The Situation %u2013 timeliness.",Rotten
An eye-opening documentary that reveals the diversity and zeal of the resistance movement in Iraq to the U.S. occupation of their homeland.,Fresh
Astonishing introduction to the Iraqi insurgents who explain why they resist occupation--a film that is a must for anybody trying to understand why the war continues to this day.,Fresh
"Although at times tedious and repetitive, Meeting Resistance is nonetheless an important journalistic document about the Iraqi insurgency.",Fresh
A little resistance might have done the project some good.,Rotten
"If nothing else, Meeting Resistance should dispel any lingering misconception that the Iraq insurgency is mainly the work of outside agitators.",Fresh
"In the brave, defiant and principled tradition of Gillo Pontecorvo's Battle of Algiers, the film is a valiant dissection of the anatomy of collective struggle, and a visionary blueprint for the end to US military madness and reckless foreign invasions.",Fresh
"Offers a rare glimpse into the hearts and minds of those who have dedicated themselves to ridding Iraq of its invaders, captured by intrepid reporters who risked their lives at a time when fragile trust was still possible.",Fresh
"Meeting Resistance argues that the failure of the war was set in its early days, when Iraqis felt alternately abandoned and threatened by Americans, and soon after, occupied.",Fresh
A chilling rare glimpse of the U.S. Iraqi occupation from the side of the insurgents.,Fresh
The problem with the film is that it makes for better journalism than cinema.,Rotten
Meeting Resistance is worth the effort. It tells a nuanced story of the Iraqi resistance that American media rarely has fleshed out.,Fresh
This documentary does one thing and does it well. It provides first person interviews with people who were attacking U.S. military forces in Iraq in 2003.,Fresh
"It offers no judgment, nor does it proffer a solution, but this slow-paced and vivid glimpse behind the veil is an achievement and an education.",Fresh
While there are some points of interest along the way -- such as a dissertation on the recruitment and training of resistance fighters -- we emerge from this patchwork of viewpoints with no real picture.,Rotten
"Of all the Iraq documentaries that have been released since the war began five years ago, this is the one that most seriously addresses the nature of the insurgency.",Fresh
"Again and again Iraqis cite restoring their pride and dignity as their reasons for planting roadside bombs, firing RPGs and lobbing mortars into the Green Zone.Hell hath no fury like a Muslim humiliated!",Fresh
"The Freshman is a dawdling, occasionally amusing stunt.",Fresh
A quirky sleeper with something truly unexpected around every corner.,Fresh
"So consistently daffy and free-spirited, it simply defies audiences to dislike it.",Fresh
Cinema fans should enjoy all the references to classic films.,Fresh
"A great actor's self-parody might be fascinating, especially if the actor is Brando. But the performance Brando gives here is anything but a good-natured goof on himself.",Rotten
There have been a lot of movies where stars have repeated the triumphs of their parts - but has any star ever done it more triumphantly than Marlon Brando does in The Freshman?,Fresh
"With Brando around, The Freshman has a snappy madness that's hard to resist.",Fresh
Forget Brando. Andrew Bergman is the star here.,Fresh
An amusing Brando and a komodo dragon - it doesn't get better in this story of a naif in the big city.,Fresh
brando's personal godfather sequel,Fresh
Clever comedy with Brando showing a good sense of humor about himself.,Fresh
Sort of amusing. Good turn by Brando.,Fresh
"A perfectly-paced, winning comedy",Fresh
A witty and enchanted comedy.,Fresh
One of the most savagely underrated films of the 1990s.,Fresh
"The casting, needless to say, is perfect, and Bergman keeps the various escalating intrigues clipping along at a brisk pace.",Fresh
A truly genial and delightful comedy.,Fresh
"Sweet and warm as well as manic, this is full of loopy surprises.",Fresh
"Broderick is his usual charming self, and there are occasional moments of inspired whimsy or absurdity.",Fresh
Great.,Fresh
"The Freshman has a preposterous plot even the writer's mother couldn't believe, and it strains and creaks down the runway, but when this baby gets off the ground, we're talking seriously funny.",Fresh
Marlon Brando's sublime comedy performance elevates The Freshman from screwball comedy to a quirky niche in film history.,Fresh
An underrated hidden treasure.,Fresh
No film offering the spectacle of a Komodo dragon being transported across a state line for immoral purposes can be lightly dismissed.,Fresh
"It's a nice premise, film informing life, and Bergman's film succeeds thanks to its sprightly pace, modest but fully realised ambition and the ever affable Broderick.",Fresh
"The Freshman is like no other comedy. Just when you think you've figured it out, it ambles away.",Fresh
Here's a chance to see a mellow Marlon Brando in his greatest comedy performance.,Fresh
"Andrew Bergman's The Freshman is a charmed comedy, the kind of seemingly effortless movie in which everything falls neatly into place, as if ordained by nature.",Fresh
Brando does a wonderful sendup of Corleone that manages to play off the Don's entrenched place in pop culture. But The Freshman is no copycat comedy.,Fresh
"The Freshman has dead spots, certainly, but makes up for them with its moments of inspired craziness.",Fresh
"In the case of this inspired comedy, the plot is a dignified bonkers combination of The Graduate, The Sting, The Godfather and The Producers.",Fresh
"Though writer-director Andrew Bergman sets up potentially funny situations, the payoffs aren't nearly as clever as they need to be. Many situations don't pay off at all.",Rotten
"Just when you've had it with the mistimed scenes and the clunky direction, writer-director Andrew Bergman comes through with an inspired piece of lunacy.",Fresh
It's fun to watch Marlon Brando parody one of his most justly celebrated roles.,Fresh
"It's the kind of material that could easily fly apart into silliness, yet Brando and Broderick help the director to keep it anchored in a certain emotional reality, which is always the source of the richest comedy.",Fresh
"Marlon Brando returns to the movies with one of his funniest performances as, in essence, Don Corleone with a screw loose.",Fresh
"Without Brando, the movie would be all gags and surfaces. But the big guy's self-parody is so charming that the whole picture resonates with his presence.",Fresh
"Bruno Kirby provides an added shot as Brando's wiseguy right-hand man, and Paul Benedict practically steals the film as the over-opinionated film prof.",Fresh
"Marlon Brando delivers six-minute sonatinas of send-up and sincerity. He keeps things light but also from tilting over into something ephemerally broad like, say, ""Mickey Blue Eyes,""a perfectly enjoyable comedy but a piffle next to this perfection.",Fresh
Performers are convincing enough to keep audience involvement in a tale of revenge: victims become victimizers.,Fresh
"Black comedy about upper-class Koreans being humiliated and worse by countryside thugs in a kind of homage to both Mozart and ""Deliverance""!",Fresh
"Half as amusing as that viral video of a sheep scaring its peeps while wearing a Halloween mask, A Bloody Aria is also less incisive.",Rotten
"The film isn't illuminating, just inflammatory.",Rotten
"With so much pointless violence for the sake of violence and a terrible non-sensical ending, this film is a grueling and pointless exercise that never fully delivers on its premise.",Rotten
"It may seem an odd thing to say about a film in which a baseball bat as an instrument of assault and rape is a recurring theme, but what makes A Bloody Aria a darkly delightful surprise is its restraint.",Fresh
For the most part A Bloody Aria has an adept way of muddying these themes for audiences expecting the usual gore-thirsty trip.,Fresh
A simply unpleasant experience.,Rotten
will ultimately confound American audiences who don't appreciate the complexities of the Korean national psyche,Rotten
"It would have been fine but the acting is pretty over the top, making scenes almost laughable.",Rotten
"although the degeneration of events from bad to worse is made unbearably tense, Won also peppers his film with black humour, without ever abandoning his allegiance to social commentary.",Fresh
"Still, Won pulls off a rare trick: to be funny and frightening while continuing to ratch the tension up and up. Performances, too, are top notch.",Fresh
"A gripping, disconcerting and thought-provoking exercise that eschews graphic horror in favour of complex, darkly funny psychological drama.",Fresh
"It's slow, bloody and pretty much devoid of merit.",Rotten
Time should surely now be called on the vogue in Korean cinema for black-comic ultraviolence.,Rotten
"Director Won Shin-yun infuses the moralisms with a pulpy energy that recalls cheery shockers such as Hostel and Saw, while also indulging in Three Stooges-style bumpkin-knockabout humour.",Fresh
"Despite the title, A Bloody Aria is unlikely to be music to the ears of extreme cinema fans.",Rotten
Sore disappointment is in store for anyone expecting Won Shin-yun's revenge/psycho thriller to emerge as the new Oldboy.,Rotten
"Won's critique of the abuse of power in South Korean society lacks trenchancy, but he subverts convention with an incisiveness lacking in much transatlantic horror.",Fresh
"It's supposedly an essay on the nature of human brutality and there is a certain amount of narrative deftness at play, but whether in the sequences of dialogue or violence, in both cases extended, the film is not merely unattractive but also uninteresting",Rotten
"I suspect it falls between two stools: not nearly grisly enough for the aficionado of extreme Asian cinema, rather too grisly for everyone else.",Rotten
"It all looks like Michael Haneke-lite but, as a comment upon the fact that people tamed by violence tend to promote it when given half a chance, it has its grimly amusing merits.",Rotten
"Korean filmmaker Won uses a startlingly in-your-face style for this outrageous examination of bullying at all kinds of levels. Both unsettling and entertaining, it also finds real terror and black humour in the least likely places.",Fresh
The perfect antidote to any disappointing summer blockbuster.,Fresh
"The result is a minor masterpiece of tone in Kenny's portrayal of a character that is absurd, guileless and shrewd at the same time.",Fresh
"Waste is a terrible thing to mind -- unless you are port-a-potty installer Kenny Smyth, the unlikely hero of a hilarious and fresh (figuratively speaking, of course) comedy from Down Under.",Fresh
"I sense that the Jacobson brothers set out to make a simple little comedy. But how grand it must be for them to see the humanity of their fresh, inventive film rising to the level of its humor.",Fresh
Crude (in every sense) but surprisingly charming.,Fresh
"A hit and prize winner in Australia, Kenny has the power to charm, no matter which way the water swirls.",Fresh
"It's like an Aussie equivalent of The Foot Fist Way, shot quick and dirty, but coasting efficiently on the affable personalities of the performers and their characters. Sweet and amusing.",Fresh
"The Australian charmer Kenny, about a hard-working, jovial employee for a portable toilet company, is a low-key study of underdog pride rather than a Larry the Cable Guy bodily function jokefest.",Fresh
"Don't worry, though; Kenny isn't so realistic that you can smell it.",Fresh
"Despite all the wild and icky antics, this is in no way your typical gross-out. Because the spotlight is less on crude easy laughs, than a genuine feel for the Chaplinesque proletarian plight of a worker just trying to find dignity in an unfeeling world.",Fresh
"The film's real accomplishment, in this era of masked superheroes, is making a paladin of a regular guy whose ethics we can all emulate.",Fresh
"The film's strongest asset is Shane Clayton, whose Kenny is the funniest thing to come out of Australia since Crocodile Dundee.",Fresh
"Funny, accessible and ultimately a good time.",Fresh
Kenny is always there in an instant with a philosophical quip and a stoic resolution.,Fresh
"The result is a mockumentary that never mocks, but instead introduces us to a character we never stop rooting for and won't soon forget.",Fresh
Funny enough to give scatology a good name.,Fresh
Old-fashioned toilet humour gets a postmodern makeover in this laconic Australian mockumentary about a mobile toilet installer.,Fresh
Kenny is hilarious - toilet humour and all - and surprisingly touching. Just remember to wash your hands afterwards.,Fresh
Charming comedy with a strong script and a delightful central performance from Shane Jacobson.,Fresh
Kenny is the genuine article.,Fresh
"If you didn't know better you'd think Kenny wasn't an actor, so naturalistic is Shane's performance and so true to milieu is Clayton's camera work.",Fresh

"Few comic characters come with that degree of wit, let alone a philosophy.",Fresh
"It's a risky strategy, but one that pays off triumphantly here.",Fresh
An unexpectedly charming and bitingly funny mock doc.,Fresh

"Rainn Wilson has already been typecast as ""that weird, crazy guy"" in every role he plays, but he seems capable of more.",Rotten
It's exactly the kind of film that I'll forget having ever seen by the time Summer is over and that's too bad as I do love the premise of the film and I'm a fan of Rainn Wilson.,Rotten
"This is pre-packaged entertainment, a product designed to give bored teenagers something to watch on a Friday or Saturday night when steamy summer nights are getting longer and Labor Day is just around the corner.",Rotten
"[A] well-crafted, feel-good satire.",Fresh
There's enough innocent charm and dumb optimism here to pad the movie's lighthearted pokes at humor.,Fresh
This satire about an aging heavy metal drummer finds a good comic rhythm.,Fresh
The only brazen thing about the film is how shamelessly it rips off School of Rock.,Rotten
"What has happened to Cattaneo (Full Monty)? His formulaic comedy about second chances ain the rock world recycles elements from School of Rock, Spinal Tap, Tenacious D, and it's not even a good star vehicle for talented comedian Wilson.",Rotten
"A great cast, solid writing, some poppy head-bopping tunes and a story full of warmth and laughs often makes up for its sometimes predictable high concept plot.",Fresh
Lightweight but likable.,Fresh
It is a goofy and amusing late summer film with more than enough laughs to recommend it.,Fresh
It's depressing when the best thing you can say about a comedy is that its second-rateness is pleasantly in sync with its unmagnetic hero.,Rotten
"I guess if you like Rainn Wilson alot, you might enjoy it. But I find his humor flat and tedious. I can't believe this is from the Oscar-nominated director who made THE FULL MONTY.",Rotten
An uneasy mixture of raucous Will Ferrell farce and kid-friendly Disney Channel teen teleflick that never gels.,Rotten
"may not rock your world, but it's a sweet little fable that doesn't trouble itself with reality",Fresh
"A comedy in the vein of ""School of Rock,"" ""The Rocker"" is a fine first starring vehicle for ""The Office"" star Wilson.",Fresh
"The timing is a bit off with this routine, even if there are a few solos that totally kick ass.",Rotten
"Feels like another one of those movies Will Ferrell turned down, so the producers had to find the next best thing (and Jack Black was already under contract to do something else).",Fresh
"Makes up for a lack of gut-busting moments simply by being genial and smartly written. The Rocker is a minor, feel-good entertainment. It's not rocket science, but its heart is in the right place.",Fresh
...an amiable little film that covers familiar ground to entertaining ends. The finale is as expected but satisfying nonetheless.,Fresh
"Certainly nothing this year will compete with the inexcusable The Love Guru for its sheer inability to create laughs, but The Rocker does its best to at least come close.",Rotten
"Wilson is buoyed by a sporadically witty script, and while there are no surprises whatsoever in the story, his goofy, puppylike charm renders what could have been a disaster merely an unfortunate event.",Rotten
"Jack Black's fearless, foolish ferocity is missing.",Rotten
"Like its protagonist, the movie is sweet but slow and a little out of date.",Rotten
The Rocker might really have rocked if it didn't feel like a cover of a couple of superior comedies.,Rotten
Audiences would be better served staying home and playing Rock Band than wasting their time on something as leaden and unfunny as The Rocker.,Rotten
"The real problem, of course, is that Fish isn't all that interesting a protagonist.",Rotten
"A juvenile fairy tale that plays like the pilot for a Jonas Brothers sitcom on the Disney Channel, The Rocker comes off as something penned by an old dude who hasn't bought music since it was sold 'on records.'",Rotten
"Rainn Wilson said in an interview on The Rocker: 'There is something about a drummer. They're not cerebral. I have a tendency to be more cerebral and reserved. But he's a big puppy dog. It was lot of fun to plunge into that character.'""",Rotten
"In yet the umpteenth arrested development manchild comedy, Rainn Wilson lets his inner Jack Black out with a good dose of Will Ferrell style body barement and mines some laughs out of a largely forgettable film.",Rotten
"A pox on the house of the individual who first told Rainn Wilson he was a funny man. For the inconsiderate moose that decided to open their trap and inspire this actor, I wish them the same discomfort I suffered while watching The Rocker.",Rotten
"A wealth of creative talent can't alter the fact that Rocker is merely a passable goof-off, and one less challenging or fun than a night spent playing Rock Band.",Rotten
"Appeals to the part of you that dreams of stage diving, counting groupies and trashing hotel rooms.",Fresh
"When the humor doesn't involve sweaty armpits or vomit, it's alternately dry, silly, and profane -- a mixed bag that will serve as a nice antidote to viewers maxed out on Apatow blue.",Fresh
"Breezily directed by The Full Monty's Peter Cattaneo, this amiable comedy features a solid supporting cast and the original songs, written by Chad Fischer of 'Superman' fame, are surprisingly good in a hooky, power-pop sort of way.",Fresh
"School of Rock, Tenacious D and about million comedies of prolonged adolescence have stripped most of the bigger nuggets from this particular seam.",Rotten
"I'm a drummer. Drummers aren't dorky. They are the heart and soul of a band, solid, dependable. Drummers aren't clueless or socially awkward. Guitarists on the other hand ...",Fresh
"The film equivalent of an inoffensive throwaway track, what we used to call a B-side, back in the days of Vesuvius.",Rotten
"The conflicts that arise are highly predictable. But there are plenty of funny moments, as well as a sweet subplot involving the unkempt drummer and the guitarist's no-nonsense mom.",Fresh
"It's a film that sometimes wants to be School of Rock, sometimes wants to be This Is Spinal Tap, but ends up more like an uninspired episode of The Partridge Family.",Rotten
A grubby little redemption comedy that in every way feels like a consignment-shop Jack Black vehicle.,Rotten
"Unfortunately, The Rocker, Wilson's first lead role in a feature film, emphasizes the wrong quirks.",Rotten
"If only the movie had some bite, some edge, some anger, some insight. Instead it's generic, staying far away from the darker temptations of the rock scene.",Rotten
"The Rocker is an amiable comedy, so efficiently constructed that you can practically see the computer software on how to write comedy screenplays at work. Nonetheless it is an enjoyable construction.",Fresh
"It's too bad the unambitious Rocker didn't give those fine performers more to do. As it is, it's only half a screenplay, and theirs is the half that's missing.",Rotten
An innocuous late-summer entry that barely rises above the level of sitcom alternative to Olympic-coverage overload.,Rotten
"The plot is ultrapredictable, but under the gentle direction of Peter Cattaneo the movie somehow works.",Fresh
"The Rocker feels safe, a long way from the cutting edge, a PG guy in a PG-13 movie, a comedy with too much 'parental guidance' to be rock 'n' roll.",Rotten
"If this isn't the laugh riot of the year, it's still a pleasant surprise, particularly for teen audiences. And in comedy seasons like this one, that's sometimes more than enough.",Fresh
"The Rocker qualifies as a B-side, but it still makes for a passable summer single.",Fresh
"Watching Rainn Wilson gyrate in The Rocker, you can't help wondering if Mr. Wilson is inhabiting a role that was originally turned down by Jack Black.",Rotten
Manages to be a notably funnier than average summer comedy despite being a fairly shameless rip-off of School of Rock.,Fresh
"While nobody's expecting This Is Spinal Tap, both the audience and the cast -- which is strong all around -- deserve better than the generic script and bland direction here.",Rotten
"The cinematic equivalent of elevator music: bland, occasionally entertaining and, once it's over, utterly forgettable.",Rotten
"It sort of gurgles, with some pleasant-sounding pops here and there. But this is essentially a film that squanders a good idea by playing things too safely.",Rotten
How much you ultimately like The Rocker will inevitably depend on how much you like Wilson. And a little goes a long way.,Fresh
"The film gets credit for heart, and a certain amount of rock 'n' roll spirit, but that's about it.",Rotten
"You want to like almost everyone in this film, but they're all undone by a weak script that really wasn't worth more than a Gilmore Girls subplot after all.",Rotten
"Tuneless execution, with flat writing and inharmonious direction as noticeable as Motley Crue's eyeliner. Or Whitesnake's snakeskin pants.",Rotten
"It can be hard to explain what makes a star, but it's fairly easy to identify a performer who doesn't have that mysterious star stuff.",Rotten
"While The Rocker may be completely unoriginal and campy at times, the film still exceeds well with great laughs and a couple of one-liners I will be adding to my collection.",Fresh
"Despite its breezy quality and occasional big laugh, The Rocker just never completely clicks as A-side material.",Rotten
"No matter how much a movie tries to convince us, emo will never rock.",Rotten
"Utterly predictable, formulaic, but not entirely unamusing.",Rotten
"I don't want to oversell The Rocker, but in a summer of erratic, assaultive comedies all up and down the budget scale, this Rainn Wilson vehicle -- a kind of Home School of Rock -- stakes out its own corner of the market.",Fresh
It's not exactly heartwarming to realize that The Rocker's Gen X fantasy of an escape from middle age is really a developmental nightmare.,Rotten
"Sadly, The Rocker is so rife with formula that a pre-school could wet nurse on it indefinitely and still never go hungry.",Rotten
"...a shameless rip of ""School of Rock.""",Rotten
"Some laughs, but this is no School of Rock.",Fresh
"If you have marginal talent as a filmmaker, this is the kind of a film you make.",Rotten
"""The Rocker"" is a likeable but sometimes awkward comedy about a likeable, awkward musician.",Fresh
"Sharp dialogue, knowing jabs at the music business, and a satisfying pay-off make this a late-summer pleasure that reminds us of what rocking out should be.",Fresh
"I felt nothing for the characters, and worse, I didn't care if Fish confronted his old band members and got even.",Rotten
Is it possible for a movie to actually kill rock n' roll?,Rotten
One of the best things about this film is the insane commitment that Wilson has to get a laugh.,Fresh
"I had a really good time watching The Rocker. I laughed, I tapped my foot to the music, and I reveled in the extraordinary Rainn Wilson.",Fresh
Wilson's amiably wild-eyed performance hits all the scripted notes in a comedy that is mostly tone-deaf.,Rotten
"It's a slave to formula, and it hits its marks satisfyingly enough to make for a pleasant time-passer, but Wilson and a loaded supporting cast are never as funny as they should be.",Rotten
The Rocker ends up doing more to whet appetites for School of Rock 2 than it does to actually entertain.,Rotten
"The Rocker has the requisite vomit, the view of some very unfortunate hind quarters and the suds. It's also got a vein of sweetness and charm.",Fresh
"I don't doubt you can find some sort of enjoyment in watching The Rocker, but it's just one of those movies you'll forget about in a couple days.",Rotten
"It's totally predictable, but if you've ever nursed a rock-star fantasy at any age, it's impossible to hate this. And the three kids are really good.",Fresh
"As a satire of the music biz and in micro, long-haired heavy metal bands, the film's obviously no 'This is Spinal Tap,' and the new songs are forgettable, just like the overall film, even if (or because) Wilson does a good Jack Black impersonation.",Rotten
Riff out? Please. This is about as hardcore as a wrestling match between Clay Aiken and Barry Manilow.,Rotten
"Memo to Rainn Wilson: A shot of a paunchy middle-aged man in jockey shorts is not automatically funny. Okay, it kind of is. But The Rocker is as formulaic as a Whitesnake song without the virtue of a four-minute running time.",Rotten
The melody of The Rocker feels predictable but the beat is refreshingly off-kilter.,Rotten
"Predictable, but fun.",Fresh
"The pratfalls and naked jokes don't eek out enough humor, and Wilson's Fish never becomes someone you can truly root for.",Rotten
There's nothing all that wrong with The Rocker. It's just that it's ordinary to a spectacular degree.,Rotten
The Rocker neither rocks nor rolls.,Rotten
"To those moviegoers who've expressed some weariness of Will Ferrell and Jack Black always doing what they do: Well, OK, here's somebody else doing it.",Rotten
"Wilson has neither the acting chops nor musician's soul to be believable, merely a rip-off of Jack Black and Will Ferrell.",Rotten
"Delivers what it promises and satisfies the filmmakers' objectives (even if it isn't my kinda movie), and despite its many predictable elements, has enough entertainment value to have elicited applause from the preview audience",Fresh
One of the problems of Peter Cattaneo's film is not knowing who it's aimed at. Kids won't identify with a bitter old rocker and the middle-aged will be hoping for more satirical Spinal Tap.,Rotten
"Likeable, if predictable comedy, enlivened by strong comic performances from Rainn Wilson and a talented supporting cast.",Fresh
"As a movie, it may not rock, but it rolls along nicely enough.",Fresh
"Amiable enough yet unadventurous and uneven, this may coax the odd big smile from viewers but it never rocks the house.",Rotten
"There are occasionally amusing moments, but the writing lacks the warmth that made School of Rock such a hit.",Rotten
It all looks good and there's a decent cast but nothing really takes off.,Rotten
"Essentially covering the same playlist as Jack Black's School of Rock, The Rocker is a good-natured, live-the-dream lark in which the one-liners score hits but the slapstick continually misses.",Fresh
Just the feelgood movie that everyone needs at the moment.,Fresh
"The film is untidy, cheery, sometimes amiable. If only it were funny too.",Rotten
"Director Peter Cattaneo will probably never repeat his Full Monty success, but even in its mediocre patches one senses a renewed eagerness to entertain.",Fresh
"A decent US ensemble cast includes regulars from Curb Your Enthusiasm and, though the pacing is too slack, some silly one-liners help to make up for it.",Fresh
"The Rocker is certainly not This Is Spinal Tap, but it is fair to moderate entertainment and Rainn Wilson holds it all together energetically.",Fresh
"Essentially a Will Ferrell Lite movie, this toothless comedy has a likeable central performance from Rainn Wilson and several hilariously spiky side characters. But it never quite hits its comical stride.",Fresh
"Uh, Mr. Projectionist? Could you stop the movie? I wanna get off now.",Rotten
"The moments don't add up to much, though, and the dramatic arc ends up feeling even narrower than it usually is in this kind of story.",Rotten
"This rock music comedy does has a few chuckles and belly laughs. And unlike a few other smug, self-satisfied comedies that have come along recently, this one at least seems to have a heart at its center.",Rotten
Just when you think the dog days of summer movies are upon us along comes a hilarious sleeper hit.,Fresh
"A whacked-out, superannuated, would-be rock star might seem to be too easy a comic target, but Wilson gives this sad sack so many fresh twists that he never wears out his welcome.",Fresh
Perhaps The Rocker's most annoying feature is that it isn't completely terrible.,Rotten
All premise and no purpose.,Rotten
"...an agreeable, sporadically hilarious comedy that benefits substantially from the almost uniformly strong performances.",Fresh
"Just because one is a scene stealer on TV does not mean he or she is big screen material, period, much less a movie star.",Rotten
More fun than a fifth of Rebel Yell and a bag of Quaaludes.,Fresh
"The Rocker is more Keane than Keith Moon: slow, safe and about as edgy as a tangerine.",Fresh
It should be a fun ride but the dialogue and plot are too predictable and Wilson has no fun with the old-fogey role.,Rotten
"Spicing up Christmas with some savvy soul, are tough love story tour guide Queen Latifah, Terrence Howard as her sidekick mute meanie, and devilish duo Katt Williams and Charlie Murphy's J-Jizzy, doing musical bad boys with deliciously nasty glee.",Fresh
There's a lot of sap in this Christmas tree.,Rotten
"There's not a single scene in Holiday that doesn't feel like it was copied from any number of other cookie-cutter rom coms, Christmas-themed or otherwise.",Rotten
Be grateful that Gabrielle Union and Morris Chestnut have the wherewithal to elevate a mediocre script.,Fresh
"Stay for the nail-biting conclusion, but only if you can stomach the horror of Queen Latifah and Terrence Howard reaching career lows as manifestations of all that is cheerful and insufferable, respectively, about the holidays.",Rotten
Picking the single dumbest element in this extremely dumb movie is easy.,Rotten
About as appetizing as a candy cane laced with arsenic.,Rotten
"The dialogue is so one-note, the plot absurd, and most attempts at humor fall flat.",Rotten
"In the annals of Noel films so wincingly, gratingly, insultingly bad that a lump of coal would be vastly preferable, The Perfect Holiday ranks alongside Surviving Christmas for sheer unwatchability.",Rotten
"Either you're in the mood for a sweet and simple Christmas movie or you're not. If you are, then Perfect Holiday should fit the bill nicely.",Fresh
Not perfect. Not really about a holiday. At least 'The' is accurate!,Rotten
The messages here are what you'd expect: Love your family. Don't be selfish. Don't tell lies. Have a happy holiday. Christmas doesn't have to be perfect to entertain you. Just like this movie.,Fresh
"The cast is game, the script is watered nog, the kids push their charm hard, Murphy is often excruciating, Union is pleasant in a sitcom mommy way, and Lance Rivera is a zero stylist.",Rotten
"Ostensibly a Christmastime comedy about romance, The Perfect Holiday manages to be none of the above.",Rotten
"The actors distinguish themselves mainly by their ability to make the material, directed and co-written by Lance Rivera, seem even more painfully awkward and unfunny than it already is -- which is very.",Rotten
"The Perfect Holiday makes the safest, blandest choices possible in delivering some Christmas cheer for the whole family.",Rotten
"Despite the flabby direction and uninspired plot, The Perfect Holiday almost works because Chestnut and Union are an attractive couple and you want them to get together.",Rotten
"The likable cast and the script's low-key humor help, as does Howard's soulful, if fleeting, presence.",Fresh
"[Queen Latifah and Terrence Howard] may be a draw, but it's too bad no one thought the endearing performances in this charming (if clich) family romance would be enough.",Fresh
"Jovial and junky as all get out, The Perfect Holiday is about what you'd expect from a holiday comedy daring to put 'perfect' in its title. As in anything but.",Rotten
"The Perfect Holiday, as many a holiday movie before it, meticulously goes through the motions, but never quite finds the magic of the season.",Rotten
[The script] hasn't been written as much as stamped out like so many cheap Christmas knickknacks that will be on the clearance shelf come Dec. 26.,Rotten
"The Perfect Holiday, directed by Lance Rivera, is that most dispiriting product, a formulaic movie that doesn't believe in itself.",Rotten
The cold void of January can't come fast enough if it means an end to releases like The Perfect Holiday.,Rotten
It's a shame that Gabrielle Union can't get better scripts than this one.,Rotten
"Queen Latifah often is the saving grace of many of the movies she's in. That can't be said of her latest, however.",Rotten
The sparks that [Union and Chestnut] ignite onscreen cannot save the disjointed mess of a film that is The Perfect Holiday.,Rotten
Dear Santa: Please leave better scripts under her Christmas tree.,Rotten
"There's not much original about the film, but it's played with high spirits and good cheer, there are lots of musical interludes, and it's pitched straight at families.",Rotten
"For fans of lousy seasonal cheer, Dec. 25 comes early.",Rotten
"Wants to be a Christmas perennial, but it wilts badly well before the final credits roll.",Rotten
"This sugarplum of a movie is held together with good intentions and paperclips, but its appealing cast and seasonal sweetness make it -- if not the perfect holiday treat, a pleasantly enjoyable one.",Fresh
"If you've seen every slushy, sentimental Christmas movie on the Hallmark Channel and are still able to keep your breakfast down, you might want to catch this.",Rotten
"Queen Latifah and Terrence Howard act as commentators, nudging the contrivances this way and that.",Rotten
The Perfect Holiday is so modest and good-natured that its flaws are hardly glaring.,Fresh
"Belying its title, the film does little to inspire good cheer toward its various imperfections. Maybe I should find Santa and ask for better films. You'll certainly wish I had if you're unfortunate enough to sit through this 'gift.'",Rotten
Most people seeing this movie might wonder what Queen Latifah did to convince Terrence Howard to take on what will surely be his worst role of the year.,Rotten
"Despite the appealing supporting performers, I'd like to cap this movie.",Rotten
"Is The Perfect Holiday a good film? The answer is: not really, but it isn't terrible.",Rotten
[A] wretched yuletide comedy.,Rotten
"If tickets to this yuletide dreck are hiding in your stocking, you'd be better off with a lump of coal.",Rotten
"In one scene, Terrence Howard kneels in a pair of shoes like Tim Conway in a 'Dorf on Golf' video, licks a lollipop and utters this line: 'I gotta go dookie.' I hope they paid him well.",Rotten
...a clumsy mess of silly contrivances and musty sight gags...,Rotten
There's no rush to see this disappointing excuse for a holiday film.,Rotten
The movie's reach extends beyond it's grasp.,Rotten
"Perfect Holiday is far from an offensive effort. It's just pathetic and forgettable, and when it comes to Christmas cheer, mediocrity should never be left under the tree.",Rotten
There's just no cynicism in this whole story. As if a woman knows how to take a compliment. But this movie allows you to suspend disbelief and buy into a woman who can say thank you.,Fresh
I'd rather watch 90 minutes of a flickering yule log video than sit through this overcooked Christmas goose again.,Rotten
It's deplorable that these two stars have been reduced to appearing in such garbage.,Rotten
Bad Santa! No cookie!,Rotten

"Despite some strong performances from the mostly amateur cast, as well as some intriguing insights into family dysfunctions and racial prejudice, the movie still comes across as being self-indulgent and at least a little disappointing.",Rotten
A dark and hilarious parable of human absurdity.,Fresh
A ponderous tragedy about put-upon manhood? A verite snoop into cultures that are sexually mingled but publicly uneasy? A pill to be swallowed in the name of serious filmgoing? Maybe all of these.,Rotten
"Time stretches out to the limits of endurance, Slimane's and ours, and there are moments toward the conclusion of this picture when you will want to scream and throw things at the screen, but it's mesmerizing. When it does end, suddenly, it feels a little",Fresh
"Never sagging, it unfolds over 2 1/2 hours. Nothing is overexplained. Indeed, it takes us time to suss out Slimane's various familial relationships.",Fresh
"Secret of the Grain may be the most ambitious, complex, and suspenseful film about a feast ever to be served at the movies.",Fresh
"When the film, as it must, comes to an end after two and a half hours, you won't be ready; the bond made to this family makes its sudden absence feel downright brutal. [Blu-ray]",Fresh
"Many great suspense sequences have been built around props: a bomb under the table, explosives in the back of the truck, a nuclear launch code. And now couscous.",Fresh
... a magnificent journey through culture and family and community.,Fresh
A beautifully painted portrait of everyday Arab immigrant life in France among a large dysfunctional family.,Fresh
"Kechiche may subscribe to Renoir's ""Everyone has his reasons,"" but here he shoots the action with a nervous tension that's more evocative of Pialat.",Fresh
The best of the film is expressed between the beats of the plot and the meandering conversations around dinner tables or over drinks on the sidewalk tables of a hotel bar. It's as joyous and genuine a portrait of a community as you'll see in the movies.,Fresh
"Almost certainly the best movie in SIFF 2008, Abdellatif Kechiche's follow-up to Games of Love & Chance burrows into a tight-knit Tunisian immigrant community in a small port town in the south of France.",Fresh
This depiction of Arab family life with all its attendant problems shares with comparable drama La Haine an empathy for immigrants.,Fresh
"[Abdel] Kechiche knows his subject and the film reflects the warmth and understanding with which he views it, though it is inordinately long at 2 hrs and 30 minutes.",Fresh
"The movie's abbreviated title is LOL, which is ironic since Ferrell offers hardly a smile, much less laughter out loud.",Rotten
"Whatever it was these filmmakers were hoping to achieve, I very much doubt the reaction they were looking for was ""weird"".",Rotten
Would that a time machine actually existed that could somehow restore the 106 minutes spent watching Land of the Lost.,Rotten
"There should be criminal penalties for wasting $100 million on a movie this dreadful. Abandon hope, all ye who enter.",Rotten
We're in Howard the Duck and Pluto Nash territory here...so awful that watching all forty-three episodes of the original without a break would be less painful.,Rotten
"Director Silberberg should have known better than to go with this draft by TV writers Chris Henchy and Dennis McNicholas, an ""SNL"" shtick-meister.",Rotten
Director Brad Silberling can't seem to decide whether he's making fun of the show's cheesy visuals or seizing on its sense of roughhewn adventure.,Rotten
"McBride and Ferrell, who seems content to spin his wheels in vehicles that indulge his passion for stripping and dumbing down, are gifted performers. Here, they are given little to work with, and deliver accordingly.",Rotten
"Modernizing a 1970s children's TV show known for its cheap special effects offered certain possibilities, but the filmmakers have traded in any kid-friendly elements for bathroom humor of dinosaur-sized proportions.",Rotten
"Land of the Lost has stray amusing ‚Ä®tidbits, but overall it leaves you feeling splattered.",Rotten
"Many of the bits are far too adult for children, yet no adult with a brain bigger than a walnut -- inside joke the filmmakers evidently thought was hilarious -- would find the story the least bit compelling.",Rotten
"Stupid on an epic scale or epic on a stupid one, Land of the Lost is as close as Will Ferrell comes these days to a 'kid friendly' movie.",Rotten
Land of the Lost sheds its TV-formula origins as a 1970s network series and becomes glib fun.,Fresh
"Boasts a lewd monkey man fond of fondling human private parts without permission, apparently not a felony in prehistoric times, boob sign language chuckles, Tyrannosaurus tongue baths, and moments of humor that seem to arrive centuries apart.",Rotten
"Land of the Lost is halfway toward amusing, which means it's just as close to awful.",Rotten
Two funny actors and a criminally underused actress tramp around an alternate reality in search of comedy but not finding much for us to laugh at.,Rotten
"Land of the Lost is only one hour and 36 minutes long, but it could easily be 15 minutes shorter without the scenes of Ferrell's meandering ad-libs.",Rotten
An amusing and incredibly strange experience that might have you laughing at the ballsiness of pulling something as crazy as this off.,Fresh
"Land of the Lost becomes an endurance test -- one that's too borderline bawdy for families and too dull and rote for anyone over 15. Who, exactly, is the intended audience for this drivel?",Rotten
Will Ferrell justifies his outsized fame in this surprisingly bizarre and dirty adaptation of the campy '70s TV time-travel classic.,Fresh
This only intermittently amusing film isn't going to win over any new fans of the divisive Will Ferrell.,Rotten
Why remake a property when the demographic you're aiming at would have almost no familiarity with the original? Wouldn't it be enough to just hire someone to write a movie with Will Ferrell and dinosaurs and be done with it?,Fresh
"Genially terrible, Lost is lazy, sloppy multiplex filler, good for a few solid giggles and not much more.",Rotten
"(T)he equivalent of a nonsexual succubus, slowly sucking out the audience's intellect with each succeeding scene.",Rotten
"It doesn't help that neither Ferrell nor McBride bring their best material, with McBride offering yet another variation on an angry redneck, and Ferrell falling back on Ron Burgundy-like bluster and nonsense exclamations.",Rotten
A soulless special effects flick crossed with a tired gross-out comedy.,Rotten
as much of a nonsensical head-scratcher as the source show.,Rotten
Will Ferrell has officially used up my cache of good will...,Rotten
This Land exists at the bottom of the pop-cultural barrel.,Rotten
"Not a children's movie, but a movie for people with childlike minds, Land of the Lost"" combines the kind of juvenile humor that might amuse a 14-year-old with a shoddy plot that wouldn't satisfy a 5-year-old.",Rotten
"The movie races around to nowhere in particular, more concerned with rarely spectacular spectacle than a beating heart.",Rotten
A pleasantly undistinguished pudding.,Fresh
"Audiences of a certain sort will be dumbstruck by how high the silliness gets piled; but whether or not you're puffin' stuff, you'll likely get lost in laughter.",Fresh
"It's not that Land of the Lost is devoid of humor or adventure... Ultimately, though, the film feels like a series of ideas thrown at the wall, with only some of them sticking.",Fresh
Preteen boys and Ferrell followers will like it fine. Wider audiences might be harder to impress.,Rotten
"On the Ferrell scale, Land of the Lost ranks squarely below Anchorman and leagues above Semi-Pro, landing right in that murky middle-ground Talladega Nights territory. Let your tolerance level for the comedian be your guide. If",Rotten
"Land of the Lost is, unfortunately, a perfect example of studio bloat: It's all noise and flash and chaos, but it lacks virtually everything that made the original television series so memorable.",Rotten
[M]erely a cynical attempt to mine some cash from one of the few remnants of Generation X's collective childhood that has yet to be picked over for the sake of nostalgia...,Rotten
"An aggressively weird, suitably uneven and decidedly un-kid-friendly keg-stand of nostalgia for those unable to scrub the fever-dream of a series from their memories.",Fresh
"Confronted with such effects, the actors make not the slightest effort to appear terrified, amazed or sometimes even mildly concerned. Some might consider that a weakness. I suspect it is more of a deliberate choice, and I say I enjoyed it.",Fresh
"Still boring, senseless and something no one should be proud of.",Rotten
"Lame sketch comedy, an uninspired performance from Will Ferrell and an overall failure of the imagination turn Brad Silberling's Land of the Lost into a lethargic meander through a wilderness of misfiring gags.",Rotten
"Dull, unfunny, and completely unsuitable for viewing by anyone who isn't a charter member of the Will Farrell fan club.",Rotten
"Tonally inconsistent, incoherently plotted and almost never funny.",Rotten
Will Ferrell is a buzz kill to this innuendo-laced comedy that's unrelated to the television series it's ostensibly based on.,Rotten
Land of the Lost makes a wise decision to never poke fun at its source material's campy flaws; instead it takes the best parts of the beloved series and puts a hilariously off-the-wall spin on it.,Fresh
"The reason this new picture works on occasion is precisely because it isn't a Will Ferrell movie; rather, it's a movie that just happens to star Will Ferrell.",Rotten
The Will Ferrell Comedy Train might be out of steam.,Rotten
"In the interim, however, he makes us laugh now and then, and that is supposedly why we're there in the first place.",Rotten
"Maybe those lowered expectations played some part, but I was very, very surprised by the actual movie.",Fresh
"a dumb, fun amusement park ride, and it touched a certain level of childlike excitement in myself. I'm a little embarrassed to admit it, but I had a blast watching it.",Fresh
"It's a little more than half and half, definitely fun to watch with some memorable parts.",Fresh
"Even Will Ferrell can't save the repetitive, inane and uninspired humor from often falling flat.",Rotten
It lives down to the source material.,Rotten
Land of the Lost is if nothing else an interesting place to visit.,Fresh
"The movie is 90 minutes of bickering and blase under-reaction to outrageous events, interrupted by gross-out scraps such as Ferrell's run-in with an enormous mosquito, which ends with a tremendous amount of blood and guts.",Rotten
"This is the worst adaptation of a classic kids TV show to the big screen since ...well, since last year's joyless movie Speed Racer. But Land raises the bar on joylessness.",Rotten
"Pity the unwitting parents who take their kids to see Land of the Lost, Will Ferrell's terminally stupid, sloppy, campy and cheesy -- and thoroughly unexciting and unfunny -- experiment in 'family entertainment.'",Rotten
I hereby pronounce Land of the Lost the funniest dinosaur movie since Caveman.,Fresh
It all amounts to a certain brand of comedy -- something closer to long-form Dada than conventional humor.,Fresh
I'm pleased to report the new Land of the Lost movie keenly understands that what was once scary is now ridiculous.,Fresh
"When it comes to movies, there's good stupid and there's just plain stupid. Land of the Lost is just plain stupid, and that's not good.",Rotten
"Land of the Lost is harmless enough. It just isn't, with the exception of a few odd air pockets, particularly funny.",Rotten
What next: The Banana Splits movie?,Rotten
"It's hard to say what audience Silberling had in mind. For the kids, there's a steady parade of dinosaurs, time-travel adventures and absent-minded- professor jokes. But there are no kids to identify with.",Rotten
"Always weird, sometimes aimless but occasionally really funny.",Fresh
"With his belligerent blankness and gawky aplomb, Ferrell has made me laugh as much as any comic of his generation, but he's not doing anything fresh in Land of the Lost.",Rotten
"Land of the Lost is an enjoyable regression to Saturday mornings gone by, as junky and sweet as a strawberry Pop-Tart.",Fresh
Land of the Lost amounts to a $100 million bet that Will Ferrell's brand of sketch comedy can survive contact with the day-glo sludge Sid & Marty Krofft purveyed. And vice versa.,Rotten
"A spin-off of the '70s TV kids' show of the same name, it's far from a good movie, but it's also more enjoyable than this season's heavier or more pretentious misfires.",Fresh
"Land of the Lost seems more intent on being off-putting than being funny. Mission accomplished, I guess, but it's not entertaining. And whoever thought it would be must have been out of his gourd.",Rotten
"[The screenwriters] haven't given Ferrell a single witty line, which may explain why he seems to be so grimly going through the motions. The jokes aren't just worn out, they're clubbed to death.",Rotten
"This dramatically, thematically and artistically bankrupt comic fantasy cost something in the neighborhood of $100 million to make and isn't worth the celluloid it's printed on.",Rotten
"Land of the Lost is not completely terrible, and it moves briskly and safely, even though its more laugh-worthy bits have already been seen in endless commercials for the movie.",Rotten
Parental Content Review,Rotten
"As long as you enjoy the actors involved, Land of the Lost will mostly deliver. If you don't, you'll vanish into an entertainment void all your own.",Rotten
"Surprisingly, the film actually delivers some great visuals, laughs and gives hope that Will Ferrell can be funny again. Rent it.",Fresh
Land of the Lost will have kids asking if they can just go see Up again. Hopefully mom and dad have a little money left after blowing it on this.,Rotten
"About once a year, I like a film everyone else despises, a film so admittedly and indefensibly bad that I have no justification whatsoever for having enjoyed it. Last year it was The Love Guru. This year it is Land of the Lost.",Fresh
"The only discernible intention in Land of the Lost, the latest comedy starring Will Ferrell acting like Will Ferrell, seems to have been to take a slight idea and make the least of it in a very expensive way.",Rotten
"More rudely silly than funny, action-comedy Land of the Lost is staged with colour and a fair amount of energy, but not much in the way of inventiveness or surprise.",Rotten
Will Ferrell and Danny McBride can find the dumb fun in anything. Too bad that Land of the Lost is so much less than anything.,Rotten
"The result is a giant mess, albeit one with about a dozen solid laughs.",Rotten
Not exactly a hundred million dollars' worth of classic comedy.,Rotten
"The only marginally interesting, if unsurprising, thing about Land of the Lost is that a lot of money has been spent on yet another cultural throwaway.",Rotten
"Land of the Lost isn't the butt of the joke, Will Ferrell is, and we've seen this movie before.",Rotten
"There are a few funny-ish moments, but the filmmakers rely too much on self parody",Fresh
"All in all, Land of the Lost is big scale escapism, even if the escapism is wanting.",Fresh
"Ferrell plays Dr. Rick Marshall, Quantum Paleologist. Well, kinda. He's really just Will Ferrell, Guy Who Wears Speedos No Matter What Movie He's In.",Rotten
"A wildly bizarre and frequently hilarious adventure that appears to be whacked-out by design, not out of sloppiness.",Fresh
"An oozing slice of stink from director Brad Silberling, writers Chris Henchy and Dennis McNicholas and star Will Ferrell.",Rotten
The biggest disappointment of the summer movie season.,Rotten
A mostly funny bowl of Dumb with the nutritional equivalent of all those giant bowls of Froot Loops you ate while watching cartoons back in the day.,Fresh
"Embrace the inane wackiness that is Land of the Lost. Seriously, you need to chuck any rational thought and just let yourself enjoy this one %u2013 and don't feel ashamed about it.",Fresh
"Land of the Lost isn't a movie, it's an endurance test.",Rotten
This seems like a good fit. A mediocre comedian featured in a parody of what some believe is the worst Saturday morning kiddie show in history.,Rotten
You sit for long stretches where set pieces fail on every level and then laugh at a PG-13-skirting entendre or an strange reference or a rambling bit of improv from McBride,Rotten
"Unfortunately, the best moments are all on view in the various trailers and film clips available on the Internet, which makes the experience of watching the complete film somewhat disappointing.",Rotten
The only positive thing I can say about Land of the Lost is that it's so bad perhaps it will put an end to the classic-TV-to-film machine.,Rotten
... an aimless romp lost in the land of juvenile humor and missed opportunities.,Rotten
It bears too much resemblance to the detritus jumbled across its frame: patchwork components trying vainly to form a cohesive whole.,Rotten
"Tiresome, repetitive and time-warped, the title says it all.",Rotten
"A big budget, limp comedic exercise in male adolescence.",Rotten
This big screen re-invention of the hokey old saturday morning series is a passably silly summer guilty pleasure thanks to the antics of Will Ferrell and Danny McBride.,Rotten
... one can't help but wonder if a more serious version wouldn't have been better... possibly even in the hands of someone like Terry Gilliam (Time Bandits anyone?),Fresh
Asks viewers to take off their thinking caps and put on their dunce hats. Comic rewards await for those who agree to do just that.,Fresh
"The interesting thing, though, when you actually see ""Land of the Lost,"" is that it ... essentially functions as a high-cost, high-gloss parody of itself.",Fresh
Farrell and McBride are great together at times in this movie.,Fresh
"Danny McBride is funny in the movie, not nearly often enough.",Rotten
"The pathetic, witless state of modern film comedy and mass appeal. Even at this level, 'Land of the Lost' bores.",Rotten
"It's a little dismaying to hear a man as funny as Will Ferrell give forth with witless exclamations like ""Captain Kirk's nipples!""",Rotten
"Defying space and time, we will see one of the worse films of this year.",Rotten
Will Ferrell's latest movie fiasco is just one more nail in the coffin of his career,Rotten
"Caught in an unfunny netherworld between kid-oriented mainstream summer entertainment and a cheap-looking green-screened sort of surreality, it might have been a watchable, no, bearable movie had it just embraced one or the other fully.",Rotten
"I had a good, dumb time.",Fresh
Saying it's slop is sort of like saying that entering a dank subway restroom at the height of the lunch rush hour is like wandering into a French perfumery. This baby stinks from start to finish.,Rotten
"Land Of The Lost is flimsy stuff, but in an appealing way. Its brainlessness and lightness of touch and ability to turn in a new direction in the blink of an eye keeps it ticking over and means it'd be churlish to say much bad about it.",Fresh
I don't know why this ridiculous film works as well as it does. Possibly it has to do with Will Ferrell being fearless about making a complete idiot of himself that is just dumbfounding and eventually seductive.,Fresh
"The ideal viewer would be, I guess, a 5-year-old who still thinks dinosaurs and urine jokes are cool, but realizes they pale in comparison with breasts and gropings.",Rotten
"Nothing at all besides two funnymen and one disposable, objectified woman running from place to place, screaming a bit, joking about bodily functions, and running around a bit more.",Rotten
"The original was unbelievably cheesy in its special effects but more sophisticated in its concepts, employing real science-fiction writers to work up ideas. Will Ferrell and partners have succeeded in reversing those priorities in this spoof.",Rotten
"Land of the Lost probably looked hilarious in pre-production, but on the big screen, it only induces the odd chuckle.",Rotten
"A Will Ferrell comedy comes with certain expectations, and the latest Hollywood adaptation of a beloved TV show does not disappoint on that front. Whether fans of the original Krofft Brothers cult TV show will go along with it is another story.",Fresh
A sure-fire candidate for one of the year's worse films.,Rotten
Somewhere in a distant corner of the near infinite universe there must be a life form that finds Will Ferrell funny. Come and take him. Please.,Rotten
"The great irony of the new big-screen Land of the Lost adaptation is that the filmmakers have spent a reported $100 million to make a movie that looks like it cost $1.95. And you know what? In a weird kind of way, I actually appreciate that ethic",Fresh
...[Will] Ferrell's talents don't extend to making something out of a nothing script.,Rotten
Lost is putting it mildly.,Rotten
"A misbegotten project that immediately alienates kid-toting parents with shameless and incessant product plugs, surprisingly foul language and other inappropriate references...",Rotten
"...too flawed to love unconditionally, while at the same time being too bizarre to hate.",Fresh
There are countless mentions of feces and urine. A woman is fondled several times. The lead character mouths a two-word vulgarity to another character.,Rotten
"The technical quality [of the effects] has improved, but the inherent cheesiness of the saucer-eyed Sleestak remains intact.",Rotten
"This just might be one of the most confused, cluttered, and off-the-mark TV adaptations to ever hit the big screen.",Rotten
The year's funniest moment may involve dino pee.,Fresh
"If you hated the show, you'll hate this even more. If you loved it, prepare to find your precious childhood memories drenched (literally) in dinosaur pee.",Rotten
"perhaps the movie isn't quite weird enough, so instead of seeming inspired in its dementedness, it just seems inept and desperate",Rotten
"Land of the Lost the movie is upbeat, pretty silly, but funny in enough portion to render it pleasant, with heavy reliance on the tongue-in-cheek art of understatement.",Fresh
"Be it dead serious, moronic racecar driver Ricky Bobby or idiotic, deadpan Ron Burgandy, Ferrell has managed to create quite the niche for himself as the honest, earnest moron.",Rotten
Just too random and silly to make any sense at all. Although there are a few laughs along the way,Rotten
"Humdrum adaptation that should, given the ripe nature of its source material, have been much better.",Rotten
"A ragbag of lackadaisical plotting, drugs references, puerile lechery and shiny effects work, an assemblage far from child-friendly yet not quite grungey enough to wow older teens.",Rotten
"It's not just the land that feels lost in Ferrell's lumbering latest. After Bewitched, you'd have thought he'd have learned to leave old TV shows well alone.",Rotten
A doughily inexpressive Will Ferrell extinguishes any flicker of originality in one of the worst performances of his career.,Rotten
"It is very surreal, absurd, and often quite gross, with loads of very arch and knowing gags. It's not going to win any awards. Really, it's a DVD rental. There are some laughs. I laughed, anyway.",Fresh
"The humour is lame and more than a little smutty, while the plot barely hangs together.",Rotten
"Neither conventional action-adventure or enough of an out-there pastiche, this really is the land of the lost.",Rotten
"It's not clear whether the director, Brad Silberling, is camping it up or simply trying to get through it all without too much strain.",Rotten
"Like a valley of sedimentary rock, the film is comprised of layer upon crumbling layer of dumbness.",Rotten
"Too rude for kids and too dumb for grown-ups, this laboured romp is a dino-snore.",Rotten
"Drawn out to 100 punishing minutes, this has all the markings of 2009's flabbiest summer turkey.",Rotten
"As a TV-to-movie remake, LOTL ranks with Lost In Space: fitfully entertaining, largely uninspired. Ferrell does his best, but ends up stranded in the middle of an ideas desert.",Rotten
"The funniest aspect of this turkey is that it cost more than $100 million to make, yet it still looks like something assembled by idiots. It's one of the most abject family films ever to have slithered out of Hollywood's nether regions.",Rotten
The crude humour is as unfunny as it is ill-judged. Set to become a favourite of bad movie clubs everywhere.,Rotten
"A lumbering and largely unamusing comedy adventure. Ferrell and McBride are occasionally funny when they head into improv territory, but on the whole it is a limp affair.",Rotten
Find your juvenile inner self and you might just enjoy Land Of The Lost.,Fresh
"Will Ferrell capers earnestly through a Journey to the Center of the Earth-style comic romp witless of script, wan of invention and pasty of imagery.",Rotten
"It's a kind of cut-price Jurassic Park, with a support cast of gabbling monkeys and lizardish humanoids, and if they don't seem far-fetched you might believe Anna Friel as a Cambridge- educated scientist.",Rotten
"This big-budget revamp of the Seventies TV series flounders around with little consistency of tone, courting kids with roaring dinosaurs and visual gags, then winking at adults with near‚Äëthe‚Äëknuckle asides.",Rotten
"A good-natured, hit-and-miss mess, further muddied by some seriously inappropriate humour.",Rotten
"The insane comedy/action hybrid emerges as a nutty, funny, unashamedly weird action comedy hybrid that is more consistently laugh-grabbing than many of its contemporaries doing far better business at the box office.",Fresh
"Land of the Lost has decent special effects but ultimately fails thanks to a poorly written script, a general lack of imagination, a series of painfully unfunny gags.",Rotten
"It's far too raunchy for family audiences, nowhere near funny enough to satisfy comedy fans, and asks us to get all nostalgic about a 70s TV show that nobody in the UK has heard about.",Rotten
"A jumbled, incoherent mess of ad-libbed indulgences.",Rotten
"In a summer of terrible blockbusters, Land of the Lost's ability to distinguish itself as the worst of the bunch (so far) is almost commendable, given that its awfulness appears to have been achieved so effortlessly.",Rotten
There's a docu-drama to be made about movies like this. About how no-one had the courage to tell the star: This ain't funny!,Rotten
"By and large, it's knockabout kids' stuff (and has been advertised on that basis), but it has some quite risqu√© smut.",Rotten
"There are genuine thrills, gross-out moments, zingy lines and a Will Ferrell in solid form. No one asked for this movie, but now that it's here, we should be pleased.",Fresh
"An odd film, which will hardly be enough to turn it into the massive hit that it needs to be.",Rotten
Will Ferrell's and Danny McBride's natural charisma isn't sufficient to save Land of the Lost,Rotten
"Not really a film version of the oft-rerun '70s Saturday morning staple that happens to star Will Ferrell, but rather a Will Ferrell movie that happens to bear the title and some concepts of the show.",Rotten
...the film boasts a pervasively puerile sensibility that's reflected in virtually all of its attributes...,Rotten
"Better than ""Bewitched,"" if only for its straightforwardness. Then again, even Nora Ephron didn't turn Will Ferrell into a colonoscopic agent for a dinosaur. Depending on if you like him, that may be a comic equivalent to the Berlin Wall's collapse.",Rotten
Ladies and gentlemen- this is it. This is the moment where Will Ferrell's shtick (already wearing thin after his last couple of films) officially got old.,Rotten
Land of the Lost is a terrible family film - let's just get that out there - but it is certain to live on as a staple of bleary-eyed uni students' movie nights; sandwiched in-between repeat viewings of The Wall.,Fresh
"By stringing together a bunch of campy retro set-ups and witty improvs, Land of the Lost manages to be a watchable comedy with plenty of laughs.",Fresh
Who is this movie being made for in the first place?,Rotten
Danny McBride and Will Ferrell make it worth a trip to Land of the Lost.,Fresh
[A] gigantic chunk of scat.,Rotten
Part of the fun in this flick is watching Ferrell turn science fiction stereotypes of the intrepid explorer upside down.,Fresh
"More jokes fall flat than actually work, but the complete strangeness of it all adds a level of charm to it that it might not otherwise have had.",Fresh
Falls short of its comic potential.,Rotten
"Lazily scripted, without even a pretense of character development or psychological depth, it offers nothing new for genre fans and no reason for mainstream auds to bite.",Rotten

...boasts a number of brutal and unexpectedly creepy interludes that instantly set it apart from its stylistically-similar yet thoroughly inferior brethren...,Fresh
"While utterly nihilistic in its attempts to disorient the audience, the directors keep ""[REC]"" a consistently terrifying experience with some of the most gruesome deaths filmed...",Fresh
An unexceptional workout for the adrenaline glands nudged up several notches by a climax that will cause muchos trouser trauma to all but the recently deceased.,Fresh
"Gripping, unsettling and truly horrific, [REC] is much more than the gimmick suggested by its title. Prepare to squirm, wince and wonder at how a potential Blair Witch knock-off is quite so grimy and engrossing. And don't eat dinner before you see it.",Fresh
The final reel is real eyes-behind-your-fingers type stuff with the filmmakers cranking up the audience's apprehension to I-really-would-rather-be-somewhere-else levels.,Fresh
"A brilliantly staged early scare signals that the safety rails are off and, despite an unexpected, last-minute swerve into the supernatural realm, the edge-of-the-seat tension is sustained to the very last second.",Fresh
"Even thought it's the third such effort to employ handheld camera in a zombie flick, this has more than enough shocks to hold its own.",Fresh
[Rec] will definitely jangle the nerves. But it's a movie that's unlikely to last in the memory.,Fresh
"At its best, ""[REC]"" is a stress test, with genuinely frightening and surreal use of grainy, fidgety camerawork and eerie night-vision.",Fresh

[REC] is ridiculously good. It's a show-stopping terror trip through something that really shouldn't work all that well.,Fresh
A well-made funhouse ride of pure terror and near-breathless dread.,Fresh

"Midway through, the plot blows a gasket and the camerawork turns altogether crazed, joggling us about in the semi-darkness while the soundtrack rings to distorted screams.",Rotten
The film corners you with the ferocity of a Spanish inquisitor with a branding iron and holds you there to the bitter end.,Fresh
. . .this film is a quick way to learn to treasure your peaceful quiet existence.,Fresh
"There wouldn't be much more to say if Spanish cinema didn't demonstrate a continued ability to reinvent the horror genre. REC, in this case, is a bad exception. [Full review in Spanish]",Rotten
"A sterling effort in the eventually overplayed ""found footage"" genre.",Fresh

The movie gives the impression of being pasted together from many different parts rather than presented as a cohesive whole.,Rotten

"Kelly tries to gather so many ideas under this movie's umbrella: He has strong ideas about the necessity of compassion in everyday life. He wonders what awaits us after death. But he can't flesh out all of these ideas properly, or even haphazardly.",Rotten

The Box is a fantastically made thriller that brilliantly captures the tone of the 70's and makes you ponder in a negative way about humanity.,Fresh
"The Box...breezes right past slick, pre-packed sci-fi to find a resting place somewhere in the outlandish and exceedingly eccentric world of artists so true to themselves that their work inspires and infuriates in equal measure.",Fresh

First-semester social-science students would wince at the overreaching metaphors in Donnie Darko director Richard Kelly's latest Rorschach test.,Rotten
The first half is a brilliantly realized exercise in sustained tension; the suspense fades as the story becomes increasingly bizarre...,Fresh

Movie Marmite. Many will be perplexed. Donnie Darko fans should lap it up.,Fresh
"While it's true that the film's sci-fi antics are far from watertight in the logic department, there's enough eccentricity and ambition at play to charm and bemuse in equal measure.",Fresh
"Think very carefully before you attempt to unlock the mysteries of The Box. There is no going back, you cannot undo your decision, you will never get back those 115 minutes, and by the horrifying end, those same 115 minutes will feel like a life sentence.",Rotten
The clueless and overreaching ambition which has started to characterise [Richard Kelly's] cinematic failures comes into play again.,Rotten
"This film just goes interminably on and on, like some pop video to a prog rock track from hell, padding things out to feature length with all sorts of incredible gibberish and extraneous nonsense.",Rotten

"A certain faecal word certainly sums up the artistic merits of The Box, a tedious and often excruciating production from Donnie Darko director Richard Kelly.",Rotten
"So shudder to think what [Matheson would] make of this dogs' dinner of an adaptation by Richard Kelly, a shambles rivalled only by the writer-director's own Southland Tales.",Rotten
"Richard Kelly returns with a tense, unnerving and jumpy thriller. It loses focus towards the end, but Donnie Darko has just entered The Twilight Zone.",Fresh
"This cosmic joke isn't as bad as Kelly's previous picture, Southland Tales, but it's still a total mess, even if it is a stylish looking one.",Rotten
"People start wandering about in a zomboid fashion but no one notices. The acting deteriorates into overwrought melodramatics. The plot gets sillier and sillier, and makes less and less sense. The Box should be taken away in one, and speedily buried.",Rotten
"Richard Kelly's Donnie Darko made him famous, but to judge by this unhappy mess he's having trouble confirming his talent.",Rotten
"The Box is based on a 10-page short story and, while it was successfully adapted for a one-hour episode of The Twilight Zone, there's not enough for a feature, let alone one lasting two-hours.",Rotten
"A shame, then, that a film that starts with asking such a definite question, to push the button or not, should end so vaguely that it fails to push ours.",Rotten
"A lot of stuff about Nasa, Mars exploration and amateur theatre - Sartre's Huis Clos and its glowing chestnut adages (""Hell is other people"") - add to the film's richness or, depending on opinion, its overcooked confusion.",Rotten
The single question I wanted to ask was: how many more times will a studio allow Richard Kelly to commit career suicide?,Rotten
"The 1976 setting is nicely evoked in some hideously familiar wallpaper, fashion choices and facial hair but the film never feels more than a convoluted shaggy dog story stretched out over a very long two hours.",Rotten
"Kelly maintains a suitably creepy atmosphere throughout and the frequently twisty plot is both intriguing and unpredictable, at least in the first half.",Fresh
"While it's fascinating and twisty, with a wonderfully creepy atmosphere, it's also pretentious and overwrought.",Fresh
"Nowhere near as bad as the hype suggests - although if you're in the mood for something straightforward, this is not for you.",Fresh
"With excellent period detail, it's a high-concept premise deftly handled by the director and beautifully played by Diaz and Marsden who turns out to be a bit of an acting revelation.",Fresh
"A heartfelt, brain-bending mystery just slippery enough for answers to remain tantalisingly out of reach.",Fresh
"...I walked into a Cameron Diaz film expecting to be treated to shlock, and concluded that I had just witnessed the rebirth of the classical sci-fi/thriller.",Fresh
"The most disturbing thing here is the yellow, oval-patterned 1970s wallpaper",Rotten
A potentially clever idea becomes a pretentious trip into the director's own obsessions.,Rotten
"The acting is stiff, the special effects look cheap and the dialogue is unintentionally funny.",Rotten
For the first half-hour the movie is engagingly mystifying in a David Lynch vein. Subsequently it modulates into a piece of didactic transcendental science-fiction in the manner of The Day the Earth Stood Still and Close Encounters.,Fresh
"The Box is by no means as indigestible as Southland Tales, and there's as much to relish as there is to groan at.",Rotten
"What is supposed to suggest a state of discomfort and unease feels more disjointed and frustrating than anything, and what's meant to be menacing soon turns laughable.",Rotten

"[Director Kelly] ventures boldly into the ludicrous, and comes out the other side with an even more sinister conclusion.",Fresh
It is a film that wants to be profound but it ends up feeling more like a lesser episode of The X Files.,Rotten
Kelly stretches a perfectly good 22-minute television episode out to two hours with an insane barrage of red herrings and metaphysical sci-fi mumbo-jumbo,Rotten
"[Richard] Matheson's original story was a short, sharp piece with a very direct point. Kelley simply uses it as a jumping off point for his own dense, weird and oddly personal ""what-if"" tale.",Fresh

Think twice about giving into foolish curiosity and leave The Box's button untouched.,Rotten
Here's one box you don't want to open.,Rotten
Richard Matheson probably wouldn't care for Kelly's adaptation too much because it certainly goes its own way. It's not perfect; it's a little slow and plodding and has a few characters that don't add much to the overall affect. But it's still quite good.,Fresh
Total head-scratch entertainment.,Fresh
Is it an odd film? Certainly. Will it creep you out more than it engages you? Probably. Should we be rewarding folks who are willing to step out of bounds and make us think? Definitely.,Fresh
Kelly treats what is essentially a Stanford University psychology experiment with inflated somberness.,Rotten

"As a dark, strange and enjoyably paranoid little sci-fi thriller, I'd say the good points outweigh the bad by a long shot.",Fresh

"Kelly is at his best when he's making mind-melting science fiction with allegorical underpinnings, but unfortunately The Box is more like a morality play with a few science fiction characters hanging around in the background.",Rotten
"In short; it's kind of a mess. And as a whole, The Box doesn't add up to anything remotely entertaining.",Rotten

It's a cute idea that a better filmmaker than writer-director Michael Schroeder could have done a lot with.,Rotten

"shrewdly shuffles together attractive young leads, cagey screen vets and a fantasy-fulfillment scenario in a slickly polished package",Fresh
"Because 21 subscribes to the allure of Vegas and not how it is infiltrated with logic and quantification, its details are subordinated in service to familiar cinematic protocol.",Rotten
"Glitzy on the surface, Luketic's fact-inspired fantasy-adventure is yet another Faustian morality tale, but as scripted it defies narrative logic and has too many implausible twists and turns and at least three endings.",Rotten

Harold & Kumar Go to Las Vegas would be lots more fun as well as more sociologically astute.,Rotten

In real life gambling is exciting; on movie screens it generally is not.,Rotten
"Despite primal instincts and fast-moving montages, 21 is a tired, music video-style fable.",Rotten

"The vast majority of 21 is pure fun; I would've loved to give it an unqualified rave, so its flaws are especially annoying.",Fresh
"... the film is such a love letter to 'Risky Business,' it almost qualifies as a pseudo remake.",Fresh
A clich√©-ridden ride through the world of blackjack.,Rotten

"While this is eager-to-please Hollywood-by-numbers fare, 21 should provoke enough interest to make you pick up a copy of the book that the film cheats to get the real deal.",Fresh
"The movie introduces a world and sells it extremely well. It does a good job of explaining the rules of the card-counting scam, and the actual blackjack scenes are quite exciting",Fresh

"The film goes through the motions of a thriller, but few thrills result.",Rotten

"It may take a rocket scientist to successfully count cards, but not to wite a smarter script than what 21 delivers.",Rotten
"Much like in Vegas, whatever happened in the book and made it so marvelous stayed in the book.",Rotten
"Treating card playing as an exciting spectator sport rather than, say, about as thrilling as watching fishing for two hours, this offbeat cautionary tale warns all those impulsive casino-bound eggheads out there, that losers come in all IQ's.",Fresh
"Empty calories, yes, but tasty enough.",Fresh
Everyone involved should have known when to fold 'em. The movie is about as interesting as counting cards.,Rotten
"It has some decent eye candy, but overall this film is bluffing if they think it's a great, intelligent blackjack film. I know I just used a poker term, but I doubt 21 would have noticed.",Rotten
"Even though you can predict what happens, 21 is still fairly compelling for a movie about counting cards at a blackjack table.",Fresh
"If only director Robert Luketic and screenwriters Peter Steinfeld and Allan Loeb had not opted for glitz. As filmmakers, they're playing for very low stakes.",Rotten
"As ever with gambling films, it's difficult to convey the thrill of winning at second hand; the human-interest complications are unconvincing and Spacey himself, I'm afraid, is a lugubrious and deadening presence.",Rotten
"Spacey makes a nicely chilly villain and Bosworth a warm and glamorous leading lady, if an implausible maths genius.",Fresh
"Disappointing thriller that's let down by a tedious script, a frankly ridiculous final act and some dodgy overacting by Kevin Spacey.",Rotten

See this for the sheer fascination of it.,Fresh
"Regardless whether there are a number of clich√©s and plot incongruities, this entertaining and fast-paced flick will find an audience hoping to learn how to beat the dealer.",Fresh
"When the movie 21 was announced with Kevin Spacey and Laurence Fishburne, it sounded like a winner. When everybody else involved in 21 was mentioned, it was doomed to be a loser.",Rotten
One can't help but think there was a smarter film to be made from this premise.,Rotten
"It's a slick enough movie, with an intriguing enough concept. It would be a much more enjoyable movie, however, if the wheels didn't come off script-wise.",Rotten
"Luketic's dunderheaded, would-be caper is a morality tale where the only moral at stake is the dullard-hero's thoughtless entitlement",Rotten

Craps out leaving you wondering how it all went so wrong.,Rotten
"Despite being ""based on a true story,"" the script is a loaded deck that plays like a pack of lies. 21 just doesn't add up.",Rotten

Slowly but expertly depicts the jousting courtship of an ill-fated love affair between a Parisian socialite and a Napoleonic war hero.,Fresh
"Patience, waiting, frustration, bad timing, lost opportunities - it takes a certain directorial boldness to highlight these as the principal themes of what is essentially a claustrophobic two-hander whose duration extends to nearly two and a half hours.",Rotten
"If you appreciate their acting, and enjoy the words of the battle between them - during which the duchess prevaricates until it is too late - it will seem fascinating.",Fresh
"The duologues between the couple seldom vary in tone: he's the doormat, and she wipes her silk slippers on him. Depardieu makes for a compelling presence, even if he's a bit one-note.",Rotten
"In a tale of passion, don't we want passion? Instead of Rivette's painterly pose-striking tableaux, would we not like some madness and modernism?",Rotten
"Severe, sometimes subdued, but ultimately fascinating.",Fresh
Terrific performances by the two leads make this a far more rewarding film than the rigorous formality might suggest.,Fresh
"No lavish costume drama, it's instead a theatrical dissection of the spiteful games lovers play.",Fresh
"A rewarding and cleverly constructed experiment - but not one that is easy to enjoy or warm to. All will agree that it's a fine thing that Rivette should still be pushing the boundaries, few will actually want to watch him doing it.",Fresh
Balibar delivers a supremely arch portrayal of a woman whose every gesture and expression seem calculated for effect.,Fresh
The whole thing is compelling from start to finish; 'cruel ironies' doesn't even begin to describe it.,Fresh
"Jacques Rivette, one of France's most original filmmakers, stumbles with his latest film from a novella by Honore de Balzac, a period drama set in mid-19th-century France and Italy that is stopped dead by the one-note performance of Guillaume Depardieu.",Rotten
"Scenes move ahead in a plodding manner. Since the film's hero is supposed to be a man without charisma, he cannot rivet an audience.",Rotten
"Demonstrando uma quase rever√™ncia √†s origens de seu projeto, Rivette cria um roteiro que ret√©m a natureza liter√°ria da narrativa.",Fresh
Rivette's handling of this talky tale is static in the extreme.,Rotten
"See it for the respectfully literal Balzac screen transcription. After all, I may have been wrong about Mr. Rivette all these years, and it would not be the first time.",Fresh
"Well acted and aesthetically attractive, the film remains by and large inert.",Rotten
The film is a piercing pas de deux that excoriates romance even as its doomed characters are consumed by it.,Fresh
"Jeanne Balibar is radiant in Antoinette's deception and self-deception that speak of and to all lovers, male as well as female.",Fresh
"It may sound like silly wordplay, but this film is nothing short of rivetting.",Fresh
"With the simplest of means, the director Jacques Rivette has cut a path to the heart of Balzac's The Duchess of Langeais.",Fresh
"The latest film from master French director Jacques Rivette is a masterful, multilayered, sometimes enigmatic work of dark irony, an assured tragicomedy of manners and more.",Fresh
"The gorgeous floorboards creak -- loudly -- in the veteran French director Jacques Rivette's fascinating drawing-room war of the sexes, The Duchess of Langeais.",Fresh
Duchess of Langeais -- compared to an exhilarating neo-New Wave movie like The Witnesses -- is always dull.,Rotten
The Duchess of Langeais contemplates an especially crazy case of l'amour fou.,Fresh
so completely ousts love and romance as a mere act that you expect curtains to sweep in at the end.,Fresh
"This old-fashioned, dialogue-driven two-hander is a very long sit for anyone not already under Rivette's spell.",Rotten
"The Duchess of Languor might be more evocative. Faithfully lifted from the pages of Honore de Balzac, Jacques Rivette's overlong, resplendently decorative drama takes on the phlegmatic air of its character.",Rotten
How a proficient practitioner of seduction tries to ensnare a Napoleonic general in her web of coquettishness in 1820s Paris.,Fresh
One of Rivette's most accessible films.,Fresh
Exquisite void.,Rotten
"Handsomely produced and featuring fine performances, the film will travel well to festivals and art houses where audiences respond to classy period pieces with a modern sensibility.",Fresh
A scarred war hero and a delicately placed courtesan spar amongst the moldering walls of Restoration Paris. A graceful story of love's struggles amidst a brutal social climate of denial and despair.,Fresh
"In principle, anyone who loves his open-ended sense of film performance as adventure...ought to thrill to Rivette's latest film. So why did I spend most of The Duchess of Langeais...fighting to stay awake?",Rotten
"After more than 50 years of idiosyncratic filmmaking, Rivette, who turns 80 on Saturday, is as intense and rigorous an artist as ever.",Fresh
Rivette tells the story at a length any other filmmaker would have halved.,Rotten
"In Jacques Rivette's remarkable The Duchess of Langeais, romantic devotion becomes a perverse kind of warfare, in which a lover who admits that he's in love loses the campaign.",Fresh
"A study in 19th-century European extremes, The Duchess of Langeais may put you off at first, but its playful tone could just as easily leave you pleasantly exhausted.",Fresh
"Without Rivette's usual daring or playfulness, but still a highly accomplished entry in the lazy, stagnant ""costume movie"" genre.",Fresh
"The movie's satisfactions are subtle, but they run deep, and there are many.",Fresh
"Both Jeanne Balibar and Guillaume Depardieu are quite compelling in their roles, and after about an hour, you fall into this film as completely as you'd fall into a book.",Fresh
"The Duchess of Langeais benefits from many New Wave innovations -- long, fluid takes and loosely organized improvisational scenes. Still, it feels like a curiously static entertainment.",Rotten
The film's a minuet fetishistically repeated until either the audience or the lovers go crazy. I'd say it was a tie.,Rotten
"Based on a Balzac story, Rivette's Duchess manages to be both old-fashioned in its settings and circumstances, and coolly modern in its view of thwarted passion and despair.",Fresh
"It is the ultimate in movie as pane of glass, completely un-self-conscious of its own movieness but simply an intensely focused examination of human behavior on a narrative armature.",Fresh
"Jacques Rivette's Duchess of Langeais seems to me a nearly impeccable work of art -- beautiful, true, profound.",Fresh
"Classy? Yes,",Rotten
"Even though it's nearly 2 1/2 hours, unfolds in flashback and derives from Balzac, then, The Duchess of Langeais is among Rivette's more succinct and approachable works.",Fresh
"A remote and chilly exercise, more museum piece than movie.",Rotten
"If you like multi-arced episodes of Masterpiece (formerly Masterpiece Theatre), the pacing might work in this padded film. As it was, experiencing this in real time was akin to watching two snails race on a muddy track.",Rotten
"The director guides the viewer through a sly consideration of near-sociopathic not-quite-lovers, one of whom finds refuge in religion, the other in romantic obsession.",Fresh
Stands with some of the best efforts of Rivette's long career.,Fresh
"The everyday moviegoer will find it as impenetrable as its heroine. But if you vibrate to nuances of style, if you enjoy tension gathering strength beneath terrible restraint, if you admire great acting, then you will.",Fresh
"Of course, it would also help if we could understand what's supposed to be so alluring about the title character, Antoinette de Langeais.",Rotten
The Duchess of Langeais is a romantic dance of death.,Fresh
"Maybe even Rivette himself is a little too delicate for this ferocious, intensely focused pair. But he's fascinated by them, and ultimately, he loves them.",Fresh
It's charged with nuance yet ultimately an exercise in compressed literary adaptation.,Rotten
Visually arresting period drama finds the core of the emotional life of its characters in the debate between the duchess and the general about love. Balzac fans will delight.,Fresh
Well-acted literary period drama based on the 1834 novella La Duchesse de Langeais by Honore Balzac.,Fresh
"...the film's pinnacle example of masterful direction, as well as the abyss-like darkness of the story's creeping sense of the fruitlessness of romance, and possibly of life.",Fresh
"By offering such a faithful interpretation of an old-fashioned vision of love, ""The Duchess of Langeais"" challenges us to ponder whether our own relationships might not be equally tortured.",Fresh
[Director Nic] Balthazar's determination to draw a positive message from a negative situation doesn't quite fit.,Rotten
"Enriquecido ainda por uma direo de arte que ilustra a tristeza do universo de Ben, este  um projeto artisticamente ambicioso que revela sua sensibilidade particularmente atravs de seus belos dilogos.",Fresh
It would be hard to guess from the final result that Balthazar has never made a film before; Ben X takes full advantage of all that the medium has to offer.,Fresh
"What leads off like a docudrama of the social ills accompanying a misunderstood condition merges into fantasy until, in very clever ways, director Nic Balthazar turns the medium into the message.",Fresh
"[Director Balthazar] has made a vivid little film about bullying and cyber-bullying, and done a remarkable job of opening up the head of a silent witness.",Fresh
"It's not the overarching naturalism of the performance that stands out but the conceptual breakdown of the portrayal into smaller, loosely connected segments.",Fresh
Ben X's brand of reality [is] as vital as it is virtual.,Fresh
There's an especially important central theme to this striking teen drama that gives the film a potent urgency.,Fresh
"In short, Ben X is a well made, superbly acted drama with an emotionally engaging script and an important message. Recommended.",Fresh
It is based on a successful play and has won festival awards. But its convoluted plot and an ending which we are not sure is real or fantasy prevent it striking home as well as it might.,Rotten
"This ""issue"" movie from Belgian director Nic Balthazar throws a dramatic feint so improbable one can almost see a cartoon question mark floating above the audience's heads.",Rotten
"An acute sense of foreboding animates this ambitious Dutch drama; clearly, something's about to go very badly wrong.",Fresh
"Flawed, but a forceful debut from a promising director.",Fresh
It's a promising idea that hits the skids.,Rotten
"The next it has cast all narrative sense to the winds as it grabs desperately at a triumphant (even feel-good) ending. So much good work, undone at a stroke.",Rotten
Ben X is about nothing and nothing.,Rotten
"It has its moments of triteness but by and large Ben X is provocative, moving and effective. It's a refreshingly different film that cleverly uses aspects of game culture to tell and intriguing story and confront difficult social problems.",Fresh
"The film's moral, technological and psychological themes are glazed over, and the manner in which Ben finally conquers his personal demons is laughably overblown.",Rotten
Nic Balthazar's morality tale is a shrewd exercise in expectation-subversion.,Fresh
Ben X boldly melds virtual reality with live-action vrit style and docudrama to create what may be a new film grammar.,Fresh
"Balthazar's aesthetic is ugly, aloof, maddeningly literal and unimaginative.",Rotten
The best movie I've seen about teen angst since Donnie Darko comes from Belgium?,Fresh
Undeniably a high-level achievement.,Fresh
"There's not a moment of warmth or ease in Ben X, Nic Balthazar's punishingly cacophonous debut.",Rotten
"The Flemish dialogue is not the only distinction of Belgian Nic Balthazar's confident, fearless directorial debut.",Fresh
The best movie I've seen about teen angst since Donnie Darko comes from Belgium?,Fresh
"A provocative, exultant stunner.",Fresh
"The film is harrowing, if maybe a bit melodramatic, until it crashes and burns in a feel-good ending.",Rotten
This is a movie specially made for viewers who like a surprise ending.,Fresh
"There are lessons to be learned, but rarely have such lessons been transformed into such vivid and emotionally affecting drama.",Fresh
"In adapting his novel and subsequent stage play, first-time writer-director Nic Balthazar seems more intent on impressing World of Warcraft gamers than honestly exploring the inner life of the mildly autistic boy at the center of his story.",Rotten
"Writer/director Nic Balthazar, adapting his own novel, would fool most as a first time filmmaker, as ""Ben X"" compellingly pulls one into Ben's world...",Fresh
"Greg Timmermans gives an exemplary performance as the title character, making his withdrawn loneliness a palpable thing.",Fresh
There is a lot to like about this daring drama but the final act pushes the suspension of disbelief to the extreme.,Fresh
"From the opening moments, as the graphics of the Archlord online game intercut with the world of Dutch teenager Ben (Greg Timmermans), we know we're in for something special",Fresh
"The ambitious themes are treated with great sensitivity and imaginative power in a tale that is both touching and beguiling, pushing beyond the form and frame of conventional feature-length fiction.",Fresh
"The journey is pretty bleak, rarely varies in tone and as for Ben, just as he struggles to relate to the world, how are we meant to relate to him?",Rotten
"DiCaprio (not Crowe) is in top form in Scott's fast-moving, visually vivid but dramatically uninvolving noirish geopolitical thriller that despite problems conveys the point that in the new war on terrorism information, not weaponry, is the key variable.",Fresh
Neither the location-based verisimilitude of Ridley Scott's shooting style nor the estimable Middle East expertise of source-material author David Ignatius can disguise Body of Lies as anything other than the contrived phony-baloney it is.,Rotten
"DiCaprio gives the role plenty of brio, while Crowe -- who reportedly gained 50 pounds to play the morally and physically sloven office spook -- is agreeably obnoxious.",Fresh
"Convincing and gripping, Body of Lies is at the epicentre of Ridley Scott's comfort zone as an action adventure with political overtones as well as some intimate human insights",Fresh
"Lies and consequences form the heart of this bold, hard-hitting drama in which people are used as commodities, while Big Brother keeps a watchful eye -- both DiCaprio and Crowe inhabit their characters totally",Fresh
"""Body of Lies"" is a cynical cinematic Kamikaze sortie where the goal is for the audience to disapprove of every smug American character and every super tricky Middle Easterner.",Rotten
"Smart and tightly drawn; it has a throat-gripping urgency and some serious insights, and Scott has a greater command of space and a more explicit way with violence than most thriller directors.",Fresh
"High marks also to Strong, the almost overly polite leader of the Jordanian security forces. His soft spoken demeanor attempts to mask the furiousness of his convictions",Fresh
DiCaprio works hard while Crowe does chores at home and eats.,Rotten
"Body of Lies isn't half bad, sprinkling in well-shot action and some moments of genuine suspense.",Fresh
"While action-adventure conventions take precedence over socio-political analysis, visceral kicks are in short supply, a situation that throws the film's tendencies toward stale misdirection and goofy melodrama into sharp relief.",Rotten
"The plot devolves into a potboiler, reduced to a series of sequences wherein DiCaprio and Crowe can posture with the requisite machismo",Rotten
The Hollywood Surge still isn't working.,Rotten
"Collaborating with a director who doesn't give a damn, DiCaprio and Crowe have made a political action flick totally without emotional impact.",Rotten
"What distinguishes the book with gripping realism may not be so apparent in the cinematic context. Still, for spy calculus, action, and character realization, I assign you to see it.",Fresh
"If you're looking for a high-tech, old-fashioned racist B-western, you've come to the right place, pilgrim.",Fresh
"Working from a screenplay by William Monahan, Scott takes rusty '80s clich√©s from the days when we were playing nuclear chicken with Russia and retrofits them to the post-9/11 world. He exposes how weary those old spy tropes really are.",Rotten
"It's a wonder that Body of Lies squanders all of those ingredients in a dry, convoluted mess.",Rotten
"For the most part, this is a pretty solid thriller that combines Government mumble jumble with some pretty exciting action sequences.",Fresh
Violent spy thriller more about style than story.,Fresh
"Each character thinks that what he's doing is the right course for the greater good. But when you break down Body of Lies to its most fundamental elements, it's really about disagreeing with your boss.",Fresh
"Body of Lies is yet another in a long, tiresome line of loud, violent, nauseating and incoherent riffs on how mercenary and inhuman the spooks in the C.I.A. are, even to each other.",Rotten
"Reaching perhaps for the artistic merit of 'Syriana,' director Ridley Scott instead unfolds a convoluted story with little wit and flat humor.",Rotten
"Leonardo DiCaprio and Russell Crowe fire up Ridley Scott's terrific political thriller, which might finally drag audiences to a flick about the War On Terror.",Fresh
Easily the smartest film to date about the post-9/11 'war on terror.',Fresh
"An unfocused, almost pointless spy thriller.",Rotten
"Anchored by an amazing performance by Leonardo DiCaprio and little else, Body of Lies limps along for over two hours, never amounting to more than a decent, if derivative nailbiter.",Fresh
"After Ridley's less-than-stellar stretch including Matchstick Men, Kingdom of Heaven, A Good Year and American Gangster, expectations are medium at best and Body of Lies does nothing to raise them.",Rotten
"The film lacks the urgency and, ironically, the intelligence required for something along these lines to succeed.",Rotten
"As disturbing as it is compelling, Ridley Scott has outdone himself with his first modern-day political thriller, delivering his strongest movie since Black Hawk Down.",Fresh
The movie has the fungible quality of the kind of book you buy for an airplane trip and toss as soon as you arrive.,Fresh
Body of Lies is certainly one of most well-crafted and intellectually engaging political thrillers to come along this year.,Fresh
"A bewildering mishmash of double-crosses, cover-ups, and cliches, Monahan's treatment unfortunately undermines some terrific performances and a solid outing for director Ridley Scott.",Rotten
"Body of Lies is most alive while relishing the surveillance and communications tools abused by Hoffman, tools that supply him military intelligence, but not the smarts or scruples to effectively use it.",Fresh
"Body of Lies clicks along at an engaging pace, legibly limning its multitude of characters and even throwing in a good bit of wry humor.",Fresh
"Oscar voters leery of voting for (gasp!) comic book movie, 'The Dark Knight,' for multiple accolades come award season finally have another option with the release of 'Body of Lies.'",Fresh
"Body of Lies nearly goes too far. As it is, this heavily political thriller becomes too serious and much too dark at times, and it doesn't seem to be serious enough when it really counts.",Rotten
"So many like-minded films have beat it to the punch that there's nothing new to offer audiences. The talents of all involved have been wasted, and so has our time.",Rotten
"It's solid filmmaking that, bafflingly, leaves little to talk about on the way home.",Fresh
A thriller that reveals the latest twists and turns in the war on terrorism.,Fresh
"Lies is a turgid Middle Eastern thriller, firing blanks as an action submission and presenting a wet match to light the fire of political discourse.",Rotten
A passable Friday night flick.,Fresh
"Its generic attributes (and title) notwithstanding,Scott's film may be the sharpest and most perceptive of all the post-9/11 thrillers -- and also the most purely entertaining.",Fresh
"Body of Lies contains enough you can believe, or almost believe, that you wish so much of it weren't sensationally implausible.",Fresh
"Makes the threats, the obstacles and the explosions seem shatteringly real.",Fresh
"It's no surprise that Leonardo DiCaprio and Russell Crowe are so good in Body of Lies, Ridley Scott's thrilling film about the war on terror, its costs and its frustrations.",Fresh
Curiously lightweight...escapes neither the slick histrionics of a typical studio blockbuster nor the clumsiness that afflicts movies with political messages.,Rotten
Isn't it time someone did a serious cost-benefit analysis on the filmmaking partnership of Russell Crowe and director Ridley Scott?,Rotten
"A tight, first-rate espionage thriller that casts a bleak light on American involvement in the Middle East.",Fresh
"Body of Lies is an expertly made, well-acted movie, and that makes it worth seeing, but it's not what it could have been.",Fresh
"'Body of Lies' is a tense, deftly paced meditation on America's role in the Middle East, and if it's not quite a war movie, it offers somber insights into the Bush administration's campaign against terror that recent thrillers like 'The Kingdom' have not.",Fresh
It's basically just an excuse for Leonardo DiCaprio to play Jason Bourne while Scott once again turns his technical expertise towards making Morocco look pretty.,Rotten
"It's an exciting movie, done in the flashy, breath-catching hyper-visual mode we expect from Scott. But in the end, it gets bogged down ...",Fresh
"Doesn't tell its story clearly, and buries its most compelling aspects beneath action scenes and romantic subplots that detract from them.",Rotten
A palpable tension grinds on you for a bit over two-hours and leaves you as drained as the film's characters.,Fresh
"Its chief bid at seriousness, a confrontational colloquy with the top terrorist near the end of the film, comes across as the awkward regurgitation of a hastily swallowed subscription to The Economist.",Fresh
"Scott, Crowe and DiCaprio construct a sophisticated, intelligent thriller.",Fresh
Where BODY OF LIES does succeed very well is in demonstrating the multitude of ways in which even very well-thought-out plans to make the world safer can become not only corrupted but can also be hopelessly compromised by other likewise world-safety-minde,Fresh
"It's a study in semisimilitude, more Google-Earthly than grounded in feelings.",Rotten
"The plot occasionally becomes convoluted and murky, but when it trains its focus on matters of treachery and intrigue, Body of Lies is exciting and compelling.",Fresh
"The result isn't a lecture about American foreign policy, but a smartly updated old-fashioned espionage thriller.",Fresh
"Body of Lies is more than anything a missed opportunity -- or perhaps, given its cellular phoniness, a series of missed connections.",Rotten
"The world of Body of Lies should feel chaotic and dangerous. But Scott's camera, smoothly gliding across one stately image after another, keeps assuring us everything is fine.",Rotten
I'm still waiting for the war-on-terror thriller that has more on its mind than the threat al-Qaida poses to movie stars.,Rotten
"DiCaprio bleeds and curses and emotes all over the desert, but the movie he inhabits seems cold, like a clockwork mechanism...",Rotten
"It's a Mideast thriller pulsing with suspense, shootouts, explosions, flashy movie-star performances and the kind of evocative atmosphere that has made director Ridley Scott famous.",Fresh
"This makes for a movie experience in which the viewer sits patiently for about 45 minutes waiting for the story to kick in, only to realize, oh. So this is it.",Rotten
"Body of Lies is excessively intricate and extremely dull, the latest example of a filmmaker giving us a disjointed, overlong movie that's unnecessarily confusing to follow.",Rotten
"Like Blade Runner, the film reminds us of the corrupting nature of power, and how those who look down on others often fail to understand the consequences of their actions.",Fresh
"Though Body of Lies hews a bit too closely to convention, it still engages throughout thanks to DiCaprio and director Scott.",Fresh
"For those who care about there being more to a thriller than pointless car chases and over-edited fight sequences, Body of Lies offers a satisfying dose of truth.",Fresh
"""Body of Lies"" is an intelligent geopolitical thriller that ... is really about the manipulation of people like chess pieces on a worldwide board.",Fresh
Body of Lies moves so fast you don't notice its oddball structure.,Fresh
"Body of Lies is a riddle wrapped in an enigma served with a side of mystery meat. It's very watchable, with some entertaining action beats, kind of a Syriania as scripted by Tom Clancy, a The Kingdom with a little less C.S.I.",Fresh
"It's a well-crafted, suspenseful effort that at least tries to appear intelligent and aware.",Fresh
"It's a little bit of Syriana, a lot of Traitor -- and an awful lot of scenes of people cursing into cell phones.",Rotten
"Body of Lies is being hailed in some quarters as a 'new' kind of war thriller. While this glitzy production may attract audiences suffering from battle fatigue, it's nothing of the sort.",Rotten
"The movie isn't witty or memorable, but it keeps you on edge, and it's the first war-on-terror film to weave its anti-U.S. politics so deeply into the narrative that the characters don't need to speechify.",Fresh
"Say what you want about the guy's early films or performances, DiCaprio is quickly and quietly turning into one of the more fearlessly talented and gifted actors working today.",Fresh
"Art may be imitating life, but it sure makes for dull movies. Body of Lies is the latest example of what a crutch this has become -- show grainy satellite images, cut to a chase in a crowded bazaar, discuss 'intel'. Repeat.",Rotten
"An apocalyptic vision of cloak-and-dagger intelligence, Lies is like a suicide note written by Tom Clancy, but the movie's gloomy inaccessibility actually makes it all the more intriguing.",Fresh
Body of Lies has its share of exciting moments -- Scott remains a master at directing physical action -- and it certainly couldn't be more timely. But it's also a safe and predictable movie about a subject that is neither.,Rotten
"As the film's episodic story gradually reveals itself, it ends up too unconvincing and conventional to consistently hold our attention.",Rotten
"A well-crafted but curiously generic spy thriller that, for its final hour at least, comes off as formulaic as its title.",Rotten
"A stumbling block for myself as a big, fat American who doesn't understand all the nuances of Middle Eastern politics is that the movie was often hard to follow.",Rotten
"Even if Body of Lies lacks a huge emotional wallop, it dishes plenty of food for thought.",Fresh
"Given the giga-talent involved -- virtuoso visualist Scott, The Departed's William Monahan adapting Washington Post columnist David Ignatius's novel -- I was hoping for something more substantive than Syriana-meets-Spy Game.",Rotten
On this basic premise builds a complicated story plied with onion layers of perspective and cunning.,Fresh
"Russell Crowe's portrayal of an overweight, amoral CIA honcho in the Middle East thriller Body of Lies is mesmerizing, chilling, disturbing to the bone and one of the best performances of the year.",Fresh
Body of Lies is an A-list project with B-game results.,Fresh
High production value and solid performances lay enough of a spit shine on an otherwise dingy pile of drivel.,Rotten
"As a movie seeking to tell a story, Body of Lies is a confused jumble.",Rotten
"This is a little too slick and commanding for its own good; despite Crowe and DiCaprio's best efforts, their characters keep getting flattened by the steamroller narrative.",Rotten
[Ridley Scott] has few peers at keeping a complex script clear and tightly focused...,Fresh
The movie is an urgent current-events thriller that falls somewhere between Syriana and the Bourne movies.,Fresh
DiCaprio helps turn what could have been a dry-as-sand Middle Eastern thriller into a compelling suspense film that questions the ethics of espionage and counterterrorism without turning sanctimonious or screedlike.,Fresh
"DiCaprio and Crowe, who both deliver excellent performances, may nevertheless be overshadowed by the outstanding turn by British actor Strong.",Fresh
"Both complicated and compelling, Body of Lies offers an audacious glimpse at the hypocrisy and religious furor fueling a struggle most Americans recognize only as a political catch phrase -- a 'war on terror.'",Fresh
"Crowe's a delight as a crafty Deputy Dawg from Arkansas; Mark Strong's Hani has an IQ to match his GQ. Surprisingly, the only undernourished part belongs to DiCaprio.",Rotten
"Body of Lies is smart, sophisticated and hopelessly uninvolving.",Rotten
"Yet in spite of the movie's high-tech veneer and its top-billed stars, Body of Lies is depressingly inert.",Rotten
"...no matter how energetically the characters tear around the desert or barrel through the teeming souks, we remain underwhelmed.",Rotten
Director Ridley Scott delivers a passable spy movie that has nothing to say about this region; he may as well have been directing from a monitor in his hotel suite.,Rotten
"Despite the dog-eared set-ups and situations, Body of Lies also has a lot going for it.",Fresh
"By the end, Body Of Lies is revealed as just another big-budget movie designed to cash in on the real-enough Middle East conflicts. It's a gangster movie without cops and criminals.",Fresh
"Some show is made of plunging the viewer into a dense cloud of moral ambiguity, but this is mostly smoke and mirrors: while the American heroes may employ some dubious tactics, the justice of their cause is never in doubt.",Rotten
"The complex plot is rendered with clarity and precision, the action scenes are very well staged, the suspense is palpable, and the performances are first-rate.",Fresh
"[C]lever and subtle and demands that you pay attention, and rewards you for doing so...",Fresh
...should seem ripped from today's headlines. Instead it plays like a typical cat and mouse spy movie with top notch production values and a tacked on romantic angle.,Rotten
"I'm not much of a mathematician, but you can say this one is Crowe Scott DiCaprio = Disappointment",Rotten
"It's a film directed by one of the best directors in Hollywood, written by one of the best writers and has two of the best actors around. How could you go wrong?",Fresh
"Like the intelligence officers it portrays, Body of Lies uses double-crosses and slight of hand to conceal a fairly formulaic story and a climax as offensively conventional as it gets.",Fresh
"Mr. Scott's professionalism is, as ever, present in every frame and scene, but this time it seems singularly untethered from anything like zeal, conviction or even curiosity.",Rotten
A cut above some of the other recent spate of Middle East-set thrillers.,Fresh
Anyone who actually sees Body of Lies will have a hard time taking it as seriously as audiences took Scott's Black Hawk Down.,Rotten
What begins as a movie suggesting the moral complexity of counterterrorism ends up feeling very much like a thriller as generic as its title.,Rotten
"I'm usually not crazy about thrillers, but this one had me engaged from start to finish.",Fresh
'Body of Lies' ends up being a mostly chaotic movie featuring lead characters it's hard to care about.,Rotten
"Bloated and far-fetched, it's filled with two-and-half-hours of meandering meaninglessness.",Rotten
"There's just not much being said in 'Body of Lies.' When it comes to novel ideas, everyone gets left out in the cold.",Rotten
"That Ridley Scott guy, he directs things pretty good.",Fresh
"It's official: the Ridley Scott who created such signature visions as Blade Runner and Alien is dead and has been replaced by a pod person that churns out slick-looking, but wholly generic big-budget time-wasters.",Rotten
"Despite a too-long running time, a silly Hollywood ending, and an unconvincing love interest, this is a well-made, high energy, fast-paced film loaded with tension.",Fresh
"DiCaprio plays a hero with terrible judgment, while Crowe hams up a pointless part to the detriment of the movie.",Rotten
Gets across a palpable sense of Iraq fatigue. Which is another way of saying it invites the audience to see the talking-Chihuahua picture instead.,Fresh
Body of Lies could've been one of those gag trailers at the beginning of Tropic Thunder.,Rotten
"Hugely disappointing film, even moreso when considering the talent involved.",Rotten
A high-priced potboiler that never comes to a boil.,Rotten
"Body of Lies delivers excellent performances along with realistic action, suspense and drama.",Fresh
Tarred with the brush of the war movie curse,Rotten
"It looks really good and has really great acting in it, [but it] doesn't amount to much in the end, emotionally.",Rotten
"The fact that Roger could have turned to Ed and said, 'I got to go see about a girl,' comes close to negating the impact this film should have.",Fresh
I lost interest in this movie somewhere between the donkey crossing the road in Jordan and the donkey crossing the road in Syria.,Rotten
"Obnoxiously typical, and only its pointlessly convoluted series of double crosses in the middle even gives it the semblance of drama.",Rotten
"Just because Leonardo DiCaprio gets worked like a speed bag doesn't mean Ridley Scott isn't pulling the punches he usually packs. It's emotionless chaos that's more like ""Collateral Damage,"" less a film weighing what collateral damage really means.",Rotten
"The new Ridley Scott thriller, ""Body of Lies,"" is a misfire, but not an embarrassment. So, that's positive, I guess.",Rotten
"There always seems to be a gunfight, torture, or fireball explosion to keep you mindlessly entertained.",Rotten
Body of Lies is the movie Syriana and The Kingdom wanted to be.,Fresh
... a forgettable spy non-thriller ...,Rotten
"Exciting enough while it's unfolding, but it lacks an original element and there aren't enough scenes where Crowe and DiCaprio are playing off each other.",Fresh
"A respectable second-rank thriller -- intelligent but muddled, action-packed but thoughtful.",Fresh
"Body of Lies may not tell us anything we didn't already know about the way the US does business in the Middle East, but it's compelling nonetheless.",Fresh
"DiCaprio's solid, though I wonder if a real CIA agent could get away with looking so earnest every second. Crowe has the right idea, in addition to all the fun: Just throw it away, throw it away and pretty soon you build yourself a clever characterization",Fresh
"Body of Lies has nothing to say about geopolitics, the action scenes are formulaic, and DiCaprio is rarely on the screen with Crowe, who coasts through the most puzzling performance of his career.",Rotten
More gripping to watch in the moment than enjoyable to recall at its end.,Fresh
"Yes, there are a couple of chase scenes, but Scott rarely shifts into high gear.",Rotten
"It works better as an action-adventure, thanks to Ridley Scott's knack for tightening the screws on the intensity.",Fresh
So much of Body of Lies lumbers along in a lazily predictable manner.,Rotten
'Body of Lies' is an adults-only story about espionage and the politics of war.,Fresh
Ridley Scott delivers an involving if sometimes meandering spy thriller and gets in some choice digs about the paralyzed state of American intelligence in the post-9/11 age.,Fresh
"The macho swagger of these US espionage interlopers around the planet has all the finesse of a wrestling ring, while imperialism is made to come off as really sexy. Body Of Lies: An Amman Gangster.",Rotten
"Body of Lies grants Ferris the usual moral rightness -- even as he's committing questionable acts, he means well.",Rotten
A timely game of cat and mouse that benefits from the performances by its two leads.,Fresh
Characters act and react with inexplicable intents and the story evolves in a manner that defies linear or random templates and certainly anything that might keep us engaged emotionally or psychologically.,Rotten
"Thanks to its high-talent pro lineup, Body of Lies passes the time well, even if it doesn't necessarily enrich it.",Fresh
"Like Alec Baldwin, Russell Crowe is way more fun to watch when he's fat.",Rotten
"Perfectly workmanlike, unimpeachably prestige-y, achingly contemporary, and a near-complete failure as revelation",Rotten
"Good solid far-fetched multiplex action-adventure fare in the Bondian mode, with awe-inspiring technology and just enough moral philosophizing laced through it to give the mind a little something to chew on.",Fresh
Just because it's really dense and layered doesn't mean it's good.,Rotten
A complicated movie about the war on terror with two terrific performances and a terrific director.,Fresh
Body of Lies proves as generic as its title.,Rotten
"Over-directed, frequently dull and ultimately disappointing thriller that wastes the talents of its two leads and strands them with a tedious script that somehow manages to be both confusing and overly simplistic.",Rotten
"Ridley Scott does not reflect on causes, only on operations. Body Of Lies may engage the warrior techno-geeks, but its amorality is uninvolving.",Rotten
"Perhaps Scott's ever-restless shooting style doesn't quite differentiate between the peaks and troughs of the narrative, yet it's still an engrossing account of the intersection between process and ethics.",Fresh
"Like Syriana without either the balls or the brains, Body Of Lies is perfectly presentable. You just expect better from the likes of Leo, Russ and Ridley.",Fresh
"But despite the immaculate production values, the satire is so unspeakably crude that it ceases to matter. A shame. Scott has been an instrumental director in the Hollywood evolution of war films. But Body of Lies is a one-note rant.",Fresh
"Body of Lies is big and bombastic, confused and irritable - a 20th-century blockbuster struggling to adapt (too little, too late) to a 21st-century terrain.",Rotten
"Scott, at heart, is a pyrotechnician rather than a political philosopher. Sometimes, during the scenes when he shows graphic acts of torture, he seems like a two-penny shock merchant, too.",Rotten
"With high-class acts to match the hi-tech savvy of Scott and his trusty crew (cinematographer Alexander Witt, editor Pietro Scalia, composer Mark Streitenfeld), this is as taut and engrossing a couple of hours as you'll experience all year.",Fresh
"Syriana, this ain't. Ridley Scott's latest misses the scope, texture or depth to dig into the moral mess of the war on terror. But this entertaining techno-thriller feeds greedily off star performances from Leonardo DiCaprio and Mark Strong.",Fresh
"Body Of Lies lacks the epic sweep of Gladiator and the emotional pull of Thelma And Louise. But it's enormously competent, with a couple of fine supporting performances from Crowe and Strong.",Fresh
"If the starry but soulless crime flick American Gangster wasn't enough to convince you Ridley Scott was a man past his prime, check out Body Of Lies - a starry but soulless terrorism movie.",Rotten
"For all the enthralling visuals and action, the film feels garbled.",Rotten
"Visually the film is so undistinguished it may be time for the maker of Blade Runner to be subjected to that film's Voigt-Kampff test, to determine whether the current owner of the name ""Ridley Scott"" is real or a replicant.",Rotten
"But it's something of a penance to sit through, a token handwringing over American dirty tricks that's just another opportunity for Scott and co to blow stuff up.",Rotten
"What's surprising is that such a heavyweight combo of Crowe, DiCaprio and Scott would waste their collective gravitas on something so light. Action and acting are both solid but there's no deeper human or political dimension to justify the running time.",Fresh
Body of Lies can't quite make up its mind whether to be an all-out thriller or a savvy political drama with something relevant to say about Muslim fundamentalism and the American response to it.,Fresh
"While this film's themes seem to address issues of terrorism and CIA meddling, and the powerful cast suggests we're in Important Movie territory, the result is essentially just a routine spy thriller: entertaining but forgettable.",Fresh
"Better than the vast majority of the post-9/11 terrorist yarns, Body of Lies is both more ambiguous and ambitious than such heavy-handed duds as Rendition and Redacted.",Fresh
"Como divers√£o, Rede de Mentiras merece aplausos. Isto n√£o impedir√°, claro, que ele seja relegado ao esquecimento completo dentro de poucos anos.",Fresh
"B√°sicamente un buen film de entretenimiento sobre un tema ""serio"" como el combate al terrorismo, armado de manera eficaz aunque superficial.",Fresh
"When Russell Crowe gives a lackluster performance, you know how meager a year it's been at the movies. In Body of Lies, Crowe is bogged down in a thankless role in a thankless movie.",Rotten
"If you're going to have a mall-ready entertainment about the war on terror, you might as well have this one. [Blu-ray]",Fresh
...better than a lot of the post 9/11 espionage films that Hollywood has made.,Fresh
"For those of us who want movies to be about something and not just empty action with minimal shallow 'moral of the story' tacked on, Body of Lies is a disappointment.",Rotten
"Passable entertainment -- but definitely not on par with the usual DiCaprio, Crowe, or Ridley Scott output.",Fresh
"A certain rawness and despairing urgency is never quite achieved for the message the film wants to deliver, and so it remains a well-intentioned, well-produced, yet generally unmemorable entertainment.",Rotten
Short on thrills and shorter on political insights,Rotten
"Visually, the film is quite striking. Few modern filmmakers handle desert landscapes as well as Mr. Scott.",Fresh
"It doesn't help that those action scenes all blend together, relying overmuch on speeding convoys of big black SUVs and surveillance planes that can see you picking your nose from miles up.",Rotten
...[Ridley] Scott's most entertaining and involving effort since 2001's Black Hawk Down.,Fresh
"Body of Lies is an extremely well paced, tightly wound, and intensely violent thriller. There is no damnation or congratulations here. As Russell Crowe muses as the end: ""No one is innocent""",Fresh
"Russell Crowe has finally realised he's just an ordinary fat guy now, and taken a role he can accurately portray.",Fresh
"It has none of the sweep of, say, Syriana, as if that mattered to the audience it's gunning for.",Rotten
"A compelling, nail-biting spy thriller.",Fresh
Director Ridley Scott makes Body of Lies a visually stylish film that also has scenes of incredible carnage and wince-inducing torture.,Fresh
"Quite frankly, it was a waste of two talented actors.",Rotten
The film's veracity is undermined by its compulsive use of glib soundbites. Not to mention an over-wound plot that begs disbelief.,Rotten
"It's James Bond via today's headlines, which should, I suppose, at least make it feel very now, but it doesn't. There is nothing in this you haven't seen before, and oodles that you have.",Rotten
"A revealing, original and extremely dramatic film... [Full review in Spanish]",Fresh
The action sequences lack pizzazz and feel decidedly old-hat for Scott.,Rotten
"Body of Lies is a well-made film, but lacks the emotional impact required to keep its audience interested.",Rotten
"Body of Lies, on the whole, is a retrograde fantasy. Its characters are unconvincing inventions.",Fresh
Rises above the mediocrity of its storyline thanks largely to its ensemble cast.,Fresh
Solely predicated on its twist ending.,Rotten
"With a storytelling sensibility more common in foreign films than mainstream ones, Passengers is a compact, thought-provoking tale that challenges the viewer while shedding light on one's own life, and how he or she has chosen to lead it.",Fresh
"This middlebrow tone poem aims for ambiguity but often veers into soporific, suspending answers (and often, viewer interest) en route to an ending that explains all.",Rotten
"Anyone who doesn't see the film's ""twist"" ending coming from miles away just hasn't seen enough thrillers.",Rotten
"The film is a little too influenced by M. Night Shyamalan, which might be the wrong way to go given the reaction to his recent films.",Rotten
"She sees dead people, maybe. Stealth movie starring Anne Hathaway as the world's worst trauma counselor slipped into a few theatres without warning. Now you've been warned.",Rotten
"In addition to aspiring to be a sensitive portrait of emotional healing, it's also a supernatural mystery, a romantic comedy, a family weepy and a corporate conspiracy drama. One plot might have satisfied audiences; fractions won't.",Rotten
"Passengers is not a film I would recommend that you rush right out to see. However, it will make a good rental on a snowy night this winter",Rotten
Passengers is a haunting little movie that builds ever so slowly to an electrifying climax.,Fresh
"The actors make a noble effort, but Passengers turns out to be just another dud in the genre of revisionist mysteries that have been messing with our heads since Haley Joel Osment saw dead people.",Rotten
The biggest shock (aside from seeing how arbitrarily movies are chosen for theatrical release) is provided by an intrusively blown newspaper.,Rotten
Did Hathaway know when she signed to this that it would be released just in time to embarrass her during her accolades for Rachel Getting Married?,Rotten
Passengers is a supernatural thriller so mechanically inept and lacking in suspense that it doesn't even pass muster as lowbrow Halloween-ready entertainment.,Rotten
The surprise ending isn't as shocking as those of Jacob's Ladder or The Sixth Sense -- two stellar examples of the genre -- but it's still dramatically potent.,Fresh
It's a long ride to a familiar destination.,Rotten
"When a picture asks you to puzzle through a chain of ambiguous clues to a surprise solution, you have a right to expect something better than watered-down Shyamalan.",Rotten
"It is dark, depressing and seems to be built entirely around a twist ending that feels less like a surprise and more like relief.",Rotten
"Even though Anne Hathaway is good, it's no reason to get really emotionally invested in her quest",Rotten

"Este primeiro grande tropeo na carreira de Garca embaraa pelo roteiro batido e pela falta de ritmo da narrativa, no sendo salvo nem mesmo pelo charme de Hathaway.",Rotten
"The plane isn't the only thing that crashes in this ambitiously conceived mystery drama with conspiracy theories, central romance & supernatural elements. You know there is something seriously wrong when the resolution is more satisfying than the journey.",Rotten
A Hitchcockian thriller that'll keep you guessing till the last reel,Fresh
An uneven and lifeless film that shifts from saccharine romance to supernatural thriller as Anne Hathaway helps a handful of survivors of a plane crash deal with the strange effects of their trauma.,Rotten
"Surreal ensemble chemistry that rarely subsides, serving up a deliriously potent supernatural plane crash yarn that should sufficiently frazzle viewer nerves on impact.",Fresh
"Filmmakers have the power to change reality on us at their whim, but if they do so in ways that make us feel tricked and cheated, then this is an unforgiveable rip-off.",Rotten
"It's a blurred pass at suspense and hesitant smooches, but with Hathaway and Wilson around to carry most of the workload, at least it's well acted.",Rotten
Initial intrigue turns into tedium and frustration as the plot heads into the territory of absurd.,Rotten
spends too much time concealing its secret to fully realize its potential as a human drama.,Rotten
"Clever as it tries to be, the end really doesn't justify the means and Passengers becomes just another example of a big idea being reduced to cinematic sludge.",Rotten
"As my idol Joe Bob Briggs used to say, that's an awful lot of plot getting in the way of the story.",Rotten
If you're a fan of watching poker on television and inventive comedy than The Grand is an entertaining experience that delivers on its premise.,Fresh
"Did Zak Penn's The Grand, an improvisational comedy set in the world of poker, cast itself?",Fresh
"Zak Penn's The Grand is a seesaw, but the setting -- the high-stakes poker subculture -- is remarkably fertile and the actors are a treat.",Fresh
"Put Herzog at the same table as Hines, Harrelson, Parnell, Cross, and Farina, and poker on film starts to look a lot less dull. Imagine what they could do with Monopoly.",Fresh
"Penn only wanted to create his world, not explore it, and failing that he axes the players as quickly as possible as though he's bored and ready for the credits",Rotten
Too much of The Grand is eaten up by thin conceits that go nowhere.,Rotten
Director Zak Penn isn't quite up to [Christopher] Guest's level but the highlights of The Grand suggest he could be someday.,Rotten
The entire film is just too low-key and bland to stir enthusiasm.,Rotten
"The Grand lacks any sort of urgency or inner propulsiveness; the actors do their little goofs, then hand them off to the next, lending the jest the frolicking but ultimately monotonous quality of a game of tag.",Rotten
"The Christopher Guest troupe couldn't have done it any better, because they would have just done the same contrived characters and uninspired bits.",Rotten
"This has lots of TV sitcom stars working very hard to be funny with ludicrous characters. If an actor looks like he's laboring to be funny, he isn't.",Rotten
"The Grand is in the grand tradition of Christopher Guest 'mockumentary' comedy satires: Its greatest asset is its eclectic, quirky-funny cast.",Fresh
"Even if you know nothing at all about the game, you'd be hard-pressed to find better entertainment for such a modest entry fee.",Fresh
"[Director] Penn could not have selected a more spoof-worthy venue than the world of high-stakes Texas Hold 'Em, and he has packed his film with actors -- many of them sitcom or sketch comedy stars -- who get the point of the exercise.",Fresh
"As middling mock-docs go, I'll put The Grand ahead of that paintball one (Blackballed: The Bobby Dukes Story) and Bob Saget's Farce Of The Penguins. And then I'll fold.",Rotten
"The 'card flick' has usually been a standard western, drama or crime deal -- that is, until a pack of mostly veteran comic actors tried their hand at improvising, Christopher Guest-style, in the highly amusing The Grand.",Fresh
"[Director] Penn has crucially miscalculated, mistakenly assuming we'd rather watch comedic actors play poker instead of watching them be funny.",Rotten
"If it never achieves the balance of broad laughs and barbed insights into human frailty of, say, A Mighty Wind, it delivers plenty of sharply funny moments.",Fresh
"This failure of steely intention, combined with a not quite satisfactory resolution of the fates of the characters, keeps the movie just shy of being a first-rate comedy.",Rotten
"The sort of half-baked vanity project favored by the Tribeca Film Festival, Zak Penn's The Grand features a slew of recognizable faces in a fitfully funny improvised comedy.",Rotten
There's a lot of material there in the poker world that is ripe for satire but it misses the boat here almost always.,Rotten
"It's obvious that The Grand's director, Zak Penn, set out to make the Best in Show of high-stakes poker, but to raise the ante, he piles up the absurdities and zany backstories.",Rotten
[Director Zak] Penn eases into the candid style and subdued rhythms of the mockumentary with a breezy confidence.,Fresh
"It's hard to believe that a lineup so stellar could generate so few laughs, but there it is.",Rotten
Worth a gamble.,Fresh
"There may be too many cooks here, too many TV stars trying to make an impression in a relatively high-profile independent film, but they connect just often enough to leave you smiling.",Fresh
"You eventually get the feeling that the actors are riffing mainly for each other. Their attitude is, 'We're talented, trust us, we know how to be funny,' but in the end, it's mostly just a bluff.",Rotten
"There are small pleasures, but not many. It especially underwhelms when you consider how Penn seemed to have found a new paradigm for this now-hoary comic form.",Rotten
"There's enough good material in the first act to almost merit a recommendation, but, like a poker player who just stops getting dealt the cards he needs, the film runs out of chips long before the credits roll.",Rotten
One-eyed Jack Faro's chances aren't assured but low odds amusement is yours for the buy-in. Satire has been dealt better hands with less bluff.,Rotten
The new film The Grand should have been called Werner Herzog Steals the Show because that's precisely what he does in this mockumentary about a poker tournament.,Rotten
"There's nothing under the surface of the comedy, although it's rarely less than amusing and frequently hilarious.",Fresh
"Without Cheryl Hines or Chris Parnell, The Grand would be a fast fold.",Rotten
"Just showing us what ex-sitcom stars and Bavarian directors do in their spare time isn't quite enough to justify The Grand, which does for poker what Best in Show did for dogs while completely avoiding any jokes about poker-playing canines.",Rotten
"The year's big dramatic gambling hit, 21, is all plot, no personality; The Grand, a comedy that follows six contenders into the finals of a poker tournament, is all personality, no plot. I'll take personality.",Fresh
The Grand gambles on its cast's improv chops but comes up only with a pair of sevens.,Rotten
"THE GRAND has it's funny moments, and there were some things that I laughed hard at, but it's 104 minutes, which is much too long to be consistently funny.",Rotten
For every scene that goes nowhere -- and there are more than a few -- there's some comedy gold lurking around the corner.,Fresh
A collection of sketches does not add up to a drama in this case,Rotten
Decided that sticking to the formula was more important than letting something organic or crazy happen.,Rotten
A typically uneven fake documentary...,Fresh
THE GRAND is a Royal Flush!!!,Fresh
It'll make you laugh enough so that you forget you've seen it all before.,Fresh
The movie benefits from unpretentiousness; it never takes itself too seriously.,Fresh
It's surprising the film doesn't feature lesbians jumping on trampolines.,Rotten
"If you liked Rocky Balboa you should be in good shape, since it's exactly the same movie, just aimed at a teeny-tiny-bit younger demographic and with an affectless leading man who avoids hambone acting by not acting at all.",Rotten
[Adam] Carolla's gangling charm and improv rhythms nicely loosen up helmer Charles Herman-Wurmfeld's studied setups without ever deviating from the story's solid underlying structure.,Fresh
"Like the boxer himself, the flick is flabby but light on its feet, ultimately exceeding expectations",Fresh
Plays mostly like wish-fulfillment for its star.,Rotten
The movie's reliance on crass humor and long-shot solutions gradually take the charm off this underdog's blue collar.,Rotten
"It's no classic, but, unlike recent attempts at sports comedy (we're looking at you, Semi-Pro), The Hammer comes through by not seeming to try too hard.",Fresh
"The Hammer isn't going to sneak past Raging Bull in the boxing-movie pantheon (or even Rocky, for that matter). But like its star, it is an underdog you can root for.",Fresh
"Remaking Rocky Balboa as a comedy isn't a half-bad idea; remaking it as a comedy starring Adam Carolla, the dreadfully unfunny former host of Loveline and The Man Show, most certainly is a terrible one.",Rotten
There are plenty of opportunities for Carolla to spout wisdom and observations.,Fresh
"Working with utterly predictable material, screenwriter Kevin Hench finds plenty of offbeat humor, and Carolla knows how to make it sing.",Fresh
"I never would have guessed that Adam Carolla, the politically incorrect radio and TV personality, could hold his own in a movie, but here's The Hammer to prove me wrong.",Fresh
"Carolla is winning in The Hammer, which evokes Rocky and just about every other lovable-loser sports movie while showing enough comic originality to hold interest throughout.",Fresh
"A nearly comatose comedy that spends its time just bum-stumbling along, never putting in the work necessary to land a solid joke or develop a winning character.",Rotten
"[Adam] Carolla's grumbly, monotoned, stoop-shouldered pessimism in The Hammer, the first feature he has penned, is actually funny.",Fresh
"Adam Carrola makes for a pretty agreeable leading man in The Hammer, a movie tailor-made to the comic strengths of the radio/TV personality.",Fresh
"While this rock'em sock'em rom com about a middle-aged man's unlikely return to the world of amateur boxing doesn't quite score a knockout, it lands a respectable number of body blows -- and belly laughs.",Fresh
"So many movies these days are overworked or overblown: The Hammer feels genuinely tossed-off. It isn't a great movie, or even a consistently good one. Yet it gets to elusive feelings about failure and success, hope and mortality.",Fresh
"It's genuinely funny, oddly romantic and surprisingly engaging for what could easily have been an obnoxious vanity project.",Fresh
"Carolla has a tendency to riff when he should be acting, and the whole project is rambling and disorganized. At the same time, though, The Hammer also has dry wit and unforced working-class swagger, and hits some surprising emotional notes.",Fresh
"The script depends heavily on familiar stand-up comedy bits, but it's full of sharp wisecracks and slacker charm.",Fresh
Adam Carolla fans will feel they've died and gone to heaven...Unfortunately it all adds up to something more like a viral video than a full-fledged film.,Rotten
"Adam Carolla isn't everyone's cup of tea, but the man can sling around an acidic one-liner with the best of them, and his starring debut is a familiar, but persuasively funny brew of clichs and belly laughs.",Fresh
I think it's a terrific little film.,Fresh
Succeeds in spite of itself.,Fresh
"To his credit, Carolla carries 'The Hammer' with self-assured ease, hoisting the film on his broad shoulders while making sure, as screenwriter, to leave some of its sharpest one-liners to his supporting cast.",Fresh
A boxing comedy with a potty mouth and warm heart.,Fresh
"Like a television show, The Hammer wields that mysterious power to keep you watching even though you know it isn't any good.",Rotten
"watchable, if not unique.. all in good fun",Fresh
"All The Hammer really adds to the boxing-movie canon is the refreshing air of not worrying about adding anything to the boxing-movie canon. That, and being funny.",Fresh
Forget the 40 Year Old Virgin. How about the 40 Year Old Boxer with Self-Esteem Issues?,Fresh
The Hammer is one of the year's nicest surprises.,Fresh
"Much of the film's charm comes from its scruffy, self-effacing modesty; it's a relaxed, affable underdog about a relaxed, affable underdog.",Fresh
"Yes, this comedy about a sad-sack, has-been boxer is painfully predictable and manages to include every cliche of the genre, but executive producer and star Adam Carolla keeps it rolling along with his trademark, deadpan rants.",Fresh
"One of the films that should not fly under the radar of sports comedy fans, ""The Hammer"" is a surprising good time at the movies.",Fresh
"It's not ""Rocky"" and it's not ""Caddyshack"", but ""The Hammer"" was a pleasant surprise and is a welcome addition to the all-too-small list of reliable sports comedies.",Fresh
"For anyone in their late 30s and early 40s who has seen a great deal of their lives pass them by, this can be very relateable.",Fresh
"The Hammer could have become a typically sappy sports flick, but [Adam Carolla] filled it with enough of his trademark humor to keep things fresh even with plotting that isn't groundbreaking.""",Fresh
A dreary parade of the familiar...unrelentingly boring and needlessly unimaginative.,Rotten
"'Shutter' is a movie that's a few years behind its time, maybe even a few decades.",Rotten
"Ultimately becomes little more than a series of derivative, predictable genre conventions without the necessary skill to back them up.",Rotten
"A flat, boring, lifeless movie pro-environmental groups ought to protest as a waste of natural resources. Perhaps 20th Century Fox could give some free popcorn to people who buy tickets to their next movie.",Rotten
Another reason not to get the 'Supernatural Package' at the one-hour photo.,Rotten
Can no one think of a different reason for ghosts to haunt people?,Rotten
"Its PG-13 rating and basic lack of gore seem designed to be uncontroversial, but of course the result of all this anti-controversy is a really dull film.",Rotten
"Personally, I prefer the Thai original, which is available on DVD. It truly gave me the creeps.",Rotten
"Luke Dawson's screenplay isn't bad, it's just pointlessly derivative.",Rotten
...like a video copy of The Ring which has so degraded that all the good bits are no longer visible.,Rotten
"The choice of a Japanese director and a number of key Japanese crew seems to have helped make this American remake a notch better than the other atrocious remakes such as One Missed Call, Pulse and The Eye.",Rotten
"The epitome of gutless, derivative hackwork.",Rotten
"It's hardly news that in a scary movie, a white girl wandering through Tokyo is frightened and harassed by some supernatural phenomenon.",Rotten
"It gets points for avoiding the graphic gore so common in horror movies nowadays, but Shutter won't make you shudder, let alone scream.",Rotten
"As far as the Asian horror remakes go, I've seen a lot worse... But then again, I've seen a lot better.",Rotten
"It's fun to root for the one who says ""Boo!"" rather than the screaming ciphers for whom we are usually asked to cheer.",Fresh
"Asian horror remakes are typically not screened for critics, and Shutter is no exception. The studios know what they have: watered-down, lifeless shells of motion pictures devoid of characters, drama, or anything remotely resembling horror.",Rotten
"A blandly cast and crafted remake of the same-titled 2004 Thai pic that itself emulated J-horror norms, which seemed a lot fresher back then. Low on real scares, atmosphere and character.",Rotten
"Strictly perfunctory in its concept and execution, Shutter presents the usual series of spooky images of a deadpan female ghost showing up at odd times and moving in the slow, jerky movements that are de rigueur for the genre.",Rotten
"The director, Masayuki Ochiai, conjures textbook J-horror miasma: clammy clinical interiors; overcast skies; diffuse cityscapes.",Rotten
"Shutter coughs up another vengeful ghost in the form of a spurned Japanese waif who appears in photographs and sets about getting her message across as many ghosts do -- in the most indirect, passive-aggressive, logic-defying way imaginable",Rotten
Ochiai directs with calm assurance -- no eyeball-rattling quick cuts here -- and Dawson's screenplay preserves most of the original script's strengths and fixes a couple of weaknesses.,Fresh
The only thrills in 'Shutter' come from watching Joshua Jackson in a couple of appealing close-ups.,Rotten
"Add Shutter to the rapidly growing list of American remakes of Asian horror thrillers, in this case a flat, simple schlocky recycling of a crafty and scary Thai flick about the supernatural and the occult.",Rotten
"Shutter is a ghost story free of logic and spirit, representative of everything that's wrong with so much of current mainstream studio fare.",Rotten
"Apparently, they really do hate us abroad. Just look at this jewel inspired by Asian fare. Risible doesn't even begin to describe it. Lost in translation? No. Lost from the get-go.",Rotten
"Oh, snap!",Rotten
The main problem is that they spelled the title wrong. The first vowel should be an I.,Rotten
"Your soul will be intact after Shutter, but it will cost you 85 minutes.",Rotten
"With Shutter, that nerve-tingling soundtrack gets heavy use almost from the beginning of the movie. It becomes tiresome.",Rotten
Shutter is seriously short on shudders.,Rotten
"At some point in Shutter you will probably lose count, along with your patience, but the film will keep right on going.",Rotten
"J-horror thrives on atmosphere and that's one of the many things missing from Shutter, along with tension, wit and, you know, scares",Rotten
"Though a presentation of 20th Century Fox, Shutter has the look and feel of a proper J-horror film.",Fresh
"Running a slim 85 minutes, Shutter could easily lose two reels and still make sense.",Rotten
"If Shutter is any indication, the reputation of professional photographers is still on the wane. Not only are photographs creepy, the film suggests, but so are photographers.",Rotten
Will the next terror-minded remake involve a possessed telegraph machine or a grudge-minded ox and cart? Neither option could be any lamer than the shock-free Shutter.,Rotten
"Suffers from cumulative mediocrity. In other words, there's only so much recycled rubbish you can endure without wanting to take a hostage.",Rotten
"Really, what's the point? It's a business deal rather than a movie.",Rotten
"What happens is the same as every other J-horror remake only less so, at least in part because it stars Rachael Taylor and Joshua Jackson instead of actual famous people.",Rotten
No one needs a telephoto lens to see what's coming in Shutter.,Rotten
Only the punning title distinguishes this one from...other entries in this exhausted genre.,Rotten
"Are more of these Asian remakes in the offering? I ""Shutter"" to think.",Rotten
The latest in the downward spiral of remakes,Rotten

"Shutter the latest photographic enlargement of an Asian horror picture, is clearer and sharper than many of its predecessors, but even the most expert re-touching cannot obscure the fact that we have seen it all before.",Rotten
"Similar to a theme park ride that scares kids, this Asian horror film frightens only newcomers to the genre from which it practically bootlegs.",Rotten
... the film feels like a made-for-TV movie.,Rotten
"Out of the list of horrible remakes I've experienced in 2008, ""Shutter"" really isn't the worst one I've seen yet, but it sure does suck enough to rank up there...",Rotten
...an absolutely redundant piece of work...,Rotten
Avoid unless you've never seen a horror movie in your life or you just have very low standards.,Rotten
"Shutter, which attempts to do for cameras what The Ring did for videocassettes, what Pulse did for computers, and what The Grudge did for grudges.",Rotten
Consider this movie to be almost as good as The Eye but with less of a coherent story.,Fresh
"The very Thai-specific charms that made the original such an unforeseen, unpredictable delight when I first saw it are almost entirely absent here.",Rotten

The latest in a seemingly endless line of Japanese horror remakes.,Rotten
Not terrible.,Rotten
There's a wealth of material to be mined from crises of faith and the idea of the church as supreme governor. But it quickly becomes apparent that subtext is too much to ask of a film that just wants cowboys and clergymen to fight vampires.,Rotten
"Priest is stylishly conceived and has the odd decent action sequence but it's also derivative, curiously flat and neither as scary nor as much fun as it should have been.",Rotten
"A dourly humourless, futuristic farrago.",Rotten
"Clawing away under its 3D dinge and slick but desensitising effects, the movie is deadly, even when it's cool - a comic-book adaptation ruthlessly shorn of the word ""comic"".",Rotten
"Drab, eye-rollingly stupid and with noisy effects designed to drown out audience snores, Priest is just about as bad as it gets.",Rotten
"Paul Bettany in a cassock with a cross biroed on to his forehead, potholing with vampires. In 3D.",Rotten
Doesn't have a prayer.,Rotten
"Not exactly an unholy mess, but still a rather too pious retread of classic sci-fi/action/horror riffs that lacks originality or pizzazz.",Rotten
"Did Paul Bettany know, when he donned the cowl of the albino monk in 'The Da Vinci Code', that he would soon be typecast as Hollywood's go-to guy for God-bothering multiplex action movies?",Rotten
"A mlange of apocalyptic western, gothic horror and vampire action movie, Priest won't win any awards for originality. Still, it's streamlined and executed well enough to earn a tip of the cap from those in its target demo.",Fresh
"At best, Priest is a passable time-waster. Mostly, it's like watching an extended Gorillaz video.",Rotten
"[E]ven though it's easy to point out how derivative it is in a lot of ways, it's also sort of thrilling in how spare and clean and unself-conscious it is about itself...",Fresh
The over-optimistic promise of a sequel will hopefully be one premise which remains dead and buried. For ever and ever. Amen.,Rotten
"In an era where monster mythology has become raw material for all sorts of mediocrity, Priest is one of the best examples of a broad-scale vampire blockbuster.",Fresh
I guess you could call it a guilty pleasure.,Fresh
"Too good-looking to be dismissed entirely, not bad enough to be worthy of outright scorn, but not good enough to watch, either.",Rotten
"The film, based in name only on a series of South Korean graphic novels, has nice, washed-out desert exteriors and some cool jet-powered motorcycles, but there's nothing in the hackneyed story or the derivative action scenes to make you take notice.",Rotten
"The whole thing -- which in less than an hour-and-a-half manages to insult Catholics, Native Americans, John Wayne fans and anybody with two I.Q. points to spare -- all climaxes in a lot of fire and smoke and CGI explosions.",Rotten
The film is somehow a disappointing combo of too-full and oddly empty.,Rotten
"I liked Priest, and I wouldn't much mind any of these characters returning.",Fresh
"A soulless sci-fi thriller about crucifix-tattooed warriors battling vampires, Priest is too serious to be any fun.",Rotten
"While I hardly hold Priest 3D sacred, I'm not throwing holy water on it and casting it out, either. It's fine, as long as you're fine with adequate horror actioners.",Rotten
"When you watch Bettany, you can't help wondering why the hell a talented actor is stuck in such an ungodly mess.",Rotten
"In the way it unimaginatively regurgitates familiar genre elements in service of preachy piousness, director Scott Charles Stewart's cinema is the equivalent of Christian rock.",Rotten
"At $12.75 a movie ticket, you might be better off buying the comic book.",Rotten
"[If] you're looking for a diverting sci-fi actioner that handily mixes the DNA of several different movies, with a few flying crosses thrown in and a heavy dose of Western mythology, sink your teeth in.",Fresh
There are some nifty touches in the big city sequences ... but the vampire-heavy scenes are nearly incomprehensible.,Rotten
"Adapted from a graphic-novel series (and what isn't these days?), this unholy mess of horror and Western clichs is, at least, blessed with a wonderfully loony premise.",Rotten
It's admirable how a movie with so many obvious influences and references can offer an experience that still feels like its own thing.,Fresh
"Lately, it feels like there are two things you can count on in a Screen Gems movie. 1) It will suck. 2) It will feature Cam Gigandet. And he will suck.",Rotten
"The simplistic directness of its storytelling is refreshing. It's as if the filmmakers realize they're wasting everyone's time, so they at least want to take up as little of it as possible.",Rotten
"Maybe I'm giving the filmmakers too much credit, but I'd like to believe there was once more to Priest than the tedious, hollow, joyless jumble that's presented here",Rotten
"Priest's shortcomings should not really come as a surprise. Previously, Stewart directed the equally lame Legion, which also mixed religion and demonic creatures.",Rotten
Its truncated running time suggests that a huge amount of it was left on the cutting room floor.,Rotten
"A surprisingly effective piece of genre filmmaking, littered with flaws but none so glaring as to sink the film as a whole.",Fresh
It just makes me sad to think director Scott Stewart and all the artists under him had high ambitions and substantial resources... for this.,Rotten

Already seems this aggressively B-level entertainment will quickly wither and disappear in the face of Hollywood's A-level events.,Rotten
"On a visceral level, Priest offers enough action and cool bits to probably hold the interest of most 14-year-old boys, but its hodgepodge story and overall derivative nature make it feel like a movie that should have come out back in the '90s.",Rotten
Things progress in a thoroughly clichd manner,Rotten
"After a strong beginning, Priest ends with a whiff of Jonah Hex about it.",Rotten
"If you have an action movie that doesn't have enough loud, wham-bam, explosive fun to wake a sleeping baby, which was the case at my screening, then you, my friend, have an action movie not worth seeing.",Rotten

Priest could never live up to its geek cool promise,Rotten
"If you've watched any of the trailers, they make about as much sense as the full feature does.",Rotten
"High production values and slick editing can't save this picture. Nor does its overbearing soundtrack music, which tries to strong-arm viewers into believing they're watching a pulse-pounding thriller.",Rotten

"Priest is so not a good movie. In fact, it's a pretty bad one, but it's also the most fun I've had at a bad movie for some considerable time.",Rotten
"Bettany exudes an intensity that lays the groundwork for an interesting character, but Priest hasn't a prayer of creating anything more subtle than the giant cross tattooed on his face.",Rotten

Priest 3D might be of interest for those keen on the comics but for others it's a very loud and chaotic but lame fantasy effort with much mayhem but insufficient payoff.,Rotten

"Vampires, cowboys and warrior priests: an unholy mess.",Rotten
"Bettany is a great actor who does melancholy very well, he also has a sense of mischief. It would be nice to see it shine a bit before it, too, fades to grey.",Rotten

There isn't anything here that is nurtured enough to resonate either emotionally or mythologically once the film is over.,Rotten
"The movie Priest was a surprisingly racist, semi-coherent piece of mindless Hollywood idiocy, complete with genocidal fantasies, derivative Blade-Runner-future stylings, and please-please-please-grant-us-a-sequel tripe ending.",Rotten

"A brooding, atmospheric exercise in upscale psychological horror.",Fresh

"At it's heart there are some good ideas in The Broken but, as I said in the beginning, it's very, very slow in revealing those ideas.",Rotten
"...grips your attention throughout, only to leave you unsatisfied at the end. Nevertheless, the journey is worth taking even if the destination is disappointing.",Fresh
Why the evil-doers need to do what they do is never explained. All we get is an atmospheric soundtrack desperately seeking a horror movie.,Rotten
"Part mystery, part horror, it keeps us wondering what the hell is going on, while the sombre lensing ups the air of menace. The silly finale undoes a lot of the fine work, though.",Fresh
"Writer-director Sean Ellis is influenced by M. Night Shyamalan, and manages an approximation of both Shyamalan's habitual look and whispery melodramatics.",Fresh
"Fleeting pleasures are undermined by an inane, directionless narrative, barely-even-one-dimensional characters and an overall sense of superficiality.",Rotten
"This chilling moodpiece is both psychological thriller and ghost story, with each holding up a mirror to how the other half lives.",Fresh
The tedium is almost as annoying as the sound effects.,Rotten
"The Brken is interesting and confident in some ways, though laden down with unfinished moods, images, ideas - and a few scary-movie cliches. It looks like a short film pumped up to feature length.",Rotten
Pompous and dour attempt at a psychological horror movie.,Rotten
"With a nod and a wink to Edgar Allan Poe and Hitchcock he has created a slick, supernatural thriller set in a cold and disquietingly quiet contemporary London.",Fresh
"A slick if derivative concept is well served by cold, grey cinematography and a chilling sense of shadowy menace.",Fresh
A cerebral horror that's more creepily unsettling than out-and-out scary.,Fresh
"Mr Ellis has some visual flair. He builds up a menacing atmosphere, and there are a few nasty shocks. However, he seems to have no sense at all of pace or humour. His screenplay is terrible.",Rotten
"This stylishly-shot psycho-thriller from Sean Ellis is a creditable stab at the horror genre, but it lacks pace and plot. There's not enough blood 'n' gore for horror fans, while thriller admirers may find it too slow.",Rotten
"This is hardly a horror classic because it takes so damn long for anything to happen. And when it does, the ideas aren't built upon, leaving you with the feeling the script is two or three rewrites away from a final draft.",Rotten
The Sneak was left wishing another film would break through the screen.,Rotten
A Babel cast in a piece of free-associative gothic babble.,Rotten
Horror fans who like their senses assaulted slasher-style with old-school gore and lots of jumpy bits may find this cerebral affair a tad too dull for their liking.,Fresh
"This unbelievably ponderous British chiller keeps priming us for some shocking revelations - oodles of ""scary"" incidental music, ominous shots of the London skyline - and signally fails to deliver them.",Rotten
Here is a film from a director with a little more imagination and skill than story-telling sense.,Fresh
"This is very much a case of style over substance, but the atmospheric camerawork never really compensates for the subdued performances and a derivative, increasingly ridiculous plot.",Rotten
The Broken isn't a bad horror film. It's just not a film-it's scary footage that serves no purpose.,Rotten
A slick but unscary spine-chiller.,Rotten
"Occasionally scary, often laughably portentous, never explained.",Rotten
"An extremely stylish, emotionally aloof film that lacks a strong enough story to create a great horror yarn.",Fresh

"This film looks good, is capably acted and builds excellent atmosphere. And then it gets lost, and so do we.",Rotten
"This rather nutty thriller begins to fall apart the more it tries to explain its premise, but it maintains a terrific sense of suspense right to the end",Fresh
"The Brken may offer a somewhat derivative resolution, but it gets there via an aptly fractured narrative, intertwining two radically different kinds of story type to disorienting effect.",Fresh

"[Star Brian] Cox calmly registers ranges of steely determination, fatherly care and regret-filled sadness with great authority.",Fresh
Those looking for an innovative new take on the prison genre should be pleased with the latest from this talented filmmaker.,Fresh
"The Escapist is a film worth seeking out, for both its fresh re-invention of the prison film genre and the absolute clinic on acting put on by Brian Cox and the rest of the actors in the film (not a weak link among them).",Fresh
"Here, the visceral, the intellectual and the spiritual all come together, elevating The Escapist beyond merely escapist entertainment, and offering something that any viewer can dig.",Fresh
"There's a strong sense of style to this prison-break thriller, + a few strongly sympathetic characters and some nifty twists",Fresh
"At last, a British crime movie that's as good as its pitch sounds: Brian Cox trying to break out of prison. Do you need to know any more to want to see it?",Fresh
"Enjoyable thriller with strong performances and some suspenseful sequences, though the ending is likely to provoke mixed reactions.",Fresh
About as plausible as platform 9 3/4 for the Hogwarts Express.,Rotten
The Escapist wrings jagged tension out of a fractured timeline.,Fresh
Wyatt and his superb cast pull it together in the movie's boldly-imagined final act that justifies the movie's sometimes elusive form and turns it into something a cut above the rest.,Fresh
Director/co-writer Rupert Wyatt deconstructs the typical prison escape story form to dramatically successful effect with the help of a strong ensemble cast.,Fresh
"O bom elenco  desperdiado por um roteiro que se julga mais inteligente do que  na verdade e por uma direo que acredita imprimir originalidade  narrativa quando, na realidade, est apenas seguindo as batidas convenes do gnero.",Rotten
"Taut, full of soul but with no sentimentality ... the tension is ingrained in the story and the performance by Brian Cox.",Fresh
"Director Rupert Wyatt and his co-writer Daniel Hardy have neatly trimmed the fat from this story -- there's almost no character, incident or visual cue that doesn't somehow enhance the plot or set up a surprise or key revelation later on.",Fresh
"The prison escape movie -- a tired genre -- gets some fresh energy in The Escapist, a compelling, carefully written and totally gripping film from the U.K. that is acted with naturalism and conviction by a smashing cast.",Fresh
Neither more nor less than a solid prison-break thriller.,Fresh
"A taut thriller that ends on a note of unexpected grace, the British prison drama The Escapist marks the impressive feature debut for director/co-writer Rupert Wyatt.",Fresh
"The splintered viewpoints help with the monotony, but from the taunting of new inmates to the cell-block sadist, we've gone through all this before, right down to the final twists.",Rotten
"Too much of this movie about prison feels only like a movie about prison, with actors posing and directors getting poetic.",Rotten
It's simply an experiment in throwing a familiar premise into a blender and seeing how it looks once it's all chopped up.,Rotten
A customarily fine performance by Brian Cox and a well-oiled supporting cast are not enough to lift this brutal and listless prison melodrama out of the ranks of '40s B movie.,Rotten
Shapes a standard prison-break drama into a metaphysical study of freedom and reparation.,Fresh
"Cox is a master of understatement, of using his gloomy eyes, his lined face and the intensity of feeling in a simple gaze or gesture to suggest the full measure of a man.",Fresh
"There's an intriguing twist to this puzzling escape-from-prison drama, as Brian Cox's convincing performance propels the flasbback/flashforward suspense.",Fresh
A rousing film packed with solid performances and relentless suspense that brilliantly reinvigorates the genre of prison escape thrillers.,Fresh
"The movie was written specifically for Brian Cox, and it's a great fit.",Fresh
This is down and dirty and raw.,Fresh
"How much you enjoy this prison drama will depend on your reaction to its fractured, flashback-laced structure. Oh, for the simple, straightforward days of The Big House!",Rotten
"It's swifter, grittier, and louder than the typical escape movie, but it still falls firmly within the tradition of underground breakouts. Its contrapuntal timelines are twisted into a surprisingly elegant first feature.",Fresh
"An old-fashioned prison breakout yarn and a tight little package of sharp acting, cloying atmosphere and narrative misdirection.",Fresh
I hate criticising someone for ambition but The Escapist is a victory of ambition over dramatic achievement.,Rotten
"The filmmakers succumb to the temptation of trying to have their escape movie cake and eat the psychological drama, too",Rotten
"Brilliant or obscure? Engaging or pretentious? Intense performances, artistic cinematography, ambitious editing and eclectic music are the filmic elements, but obtuse storytelling with almost incomprehensible dialogue completes the picture",Rotten
A combination of a superb score and amazing performances make this a genre defying prison break film.,Fresh
"A fractured, stylish and tense affair built around a band of great performances.",Fresh
"This is a rather curious film, admirable in some ways but also strangely frustrating.",Rotten
"The two narrative tracks only really come together at the end, and meanwhile we have to work a bit too hard to keep track of it all.",Rotten
"By keeping the focus on the humanity, Rupert Wyatt makes a strong debut as a writer/director here, and his film's got a great sense of low-budget style.",Fresh
Prison drama breaks all the rules - and wins.,Fresh
"Unfortunately, the depiction of prison life is predictable and the inmates are extremely dull stereotypes.",Rotten
The Escapist is not an easy movie to watch.,Rotten
"Sympathetic, genial and exceedingly wholesome, it's a film that, once seen, will permanently and favorably influence the way viewers regard the characters' real-life counterparts.",Fresh
"The immigrant experience has been seen many times on film before but rarely with the authenticity, wit and intelligence of Anna Boden and Ryan Fleck's Sugar.",Fresh
"Boden and Fleck know what they're doing, and I'd expect we'll see many more films from this pair in the coming years. They're just warming up.",Fresh
"Directors Ryan Fleck and Anna Boden use Sugar's tale to draw attention to pertinent social and economic issues. Thankfully, they do so with a light touch and an immense feeling of sympathy for their characters.",Fresh
"Rich in texture and colour, music and aura.",Fresh
"In a world where too many filmmakers are content to bunt their way onto second base, Sugar swings for the fences, and knocks one out of the park.",Fresh
The sweet title character just might prompt American audiences to call for an open door policy to all immigrants who want to live in America.,Fresh
"A deeply felt, personal story, exposing in very specific microcosm the struggle experienced by thousands of immigrants each year.",Fresh
The gifted team behind Half Neslon has now made another compelling and honest film that's emotionally effective as a sports saga as well as immigrant and culture-collision tale.,Fresh
Fictionalized tale of a Dominican baseball player trying to make it in the States is also a wonderfully observant film about acculturation and the immigrant experience.,Fresh
"A more bitter than sweet tale told with uncommon sensitivity and uncanny scrutiny of race and class, about exploited immigrant ball players in a game that has evolved into ruthless baseball capitalism.",Fresh
"An immigrant's saga more than ""a baseball movie,"" Sugar ultimately runs headlong away from the clich√©s that mar formula sports-related narrative films.",Fresh
"As inspirational as it is heartbreaking, a moving story about pursuing one's dreams and how one can still find a life for oneself even if those dreams don't come to fruition.",Fresh
"The filmmakers' confidently modest helming ... allows events to feel, if not fresh, then at least real.",Fresh
Such indie banality -- linked to liberal message-mongering -- proves Fleck-Boden go into a slump long before rookie Miguel.,Rotten
"This is a sports drama of total originality, as well as the most authentic inside view of the immigrant experience the movies have given us in quite a while.",Fresh
"Anna Boden and Ryan Fleck have transformed some of the saggiest, most clich√©d genres with smarts, non-screechy politics, superb acting, and visual beauty.",Fresh
A combination sports story and immigrant account that reveals the wisdom of downsizing our dreams and making choices that affirm our deep-seated need for community.,Fresh
"It's a beautifully made film about a young man's journey of self-discovery, about how Miguel ""Sugar"" Santos makes his way in the world and tries to figure out, as we all do, who he is meant to be.",Fresh
"It is both sad and hopeful, but the film's sorrow and its optimism arise from its rarest and most thrilling quality, which is its deep and humane honesty.",Fresh
Boden and Fleck are exceptional talents who refuse to sweeten Sugar for mass consumption. The result is raw and riveting.,Fresh
A quietly surprising drama.,Fresh
"Think of it as a subtle arthouse antidote to the groaning galaxy of baseball movies, a film more concerned with character, mood, and capturing a highly specific cultural milieu than with big games that invariably come down to the very last inning.",Fresh
a movie in search of the yearning for even the smallest American dream,Fresh
"How many sports dramas dare to think beyond winning, losing and how you play the game? The narrative thrust of Sugar comes from somewhere less expected.",Fresh
"Quiet, deliberate and naturalistic...refreshingly truthful, especially for a picture about sports",Fresh
"The most remarkable thing Sugar does is give American viewers a sense of how our country must seem to a newly arrived immigrant, without caricaturing or condescending to either guest or host.",Fresh
"It seems Fleck and Boden didn't have much of a game plan for the main character off the mound after all, and this wearying aimlessness waters down the tension of Sugar's rapidly imploding life, grinding the film to a disappointing halt.",Rotten
"An often engaging drama that tackles provocative issues, but, without a sensitive and intelligent screenplay, it ultimately fails to be truly moving, profound or memorable.",Rotten
"A striking document of an immigrant's journey, in some ways reminiscent of Elia Kazan's Oscar nominated 1963 film, ""America, America"".",Fresh
Let down by a manipulative script recycled from dozens of sports and immigrant movies. At least it dispenses with a Hollywood ending.,Rotten
A thoughtful drama about guys who have a moment in the big time before returning home to an odd reflected glory.,Fresh
Sugar is an inside-the-park homer.,Fresh
"A moving, surprising and provocative baseball flick that rises immediately to No. 1 with a bullet on my personal list.",Fresh
"Sugar stands the baseball movie on its head by approaching the genre with off-speed material, instead of the plot equivalent of sizzling fastballs and home runs.",Fresh
...a rich character study of the title ball player and his metamorphosis into something greater than he could have expected %u2013 to live as a free and happy man doing what he really wants in his life.,Fresh
This is one of my favorite movies of the year so far...,Fresh
Fleck and Boden are clearly storytellers.,Fresh
It's got an authenticity that most sports films lack.,Fresh
"In this carefully observed and impressively minimalist movie, Sugar redefines and refines his art.",Fresh
"In its unhurried fashion, Sugar can take its place with the best baseball movies. Where most focus on the grand slam, this one's about the life that surrounds the game and everything that comes after.",Fresh
Scenes that would usually be mere setup ... become engaging in their own right. ... game and practice sequences have an easy authenticity from the start.,Fresh
"Some of the surprise of seeing a major new talent appear from thin air is lost in even a strong sophomore effort, but Boden and Fleck have set and met a high standard for their work. I found it sublime.",Fresh
"Sugar is a gripping look at the immigrant experience, with small moments as important -- and visually arresting -- as any on the baseball diamond.",Fresh
"...an interesting tale of a young man devoted to his family back home, trying to come to grips with surviving in a completely different culture.",Fresh
This Sugar doesn't blend the sweet with the bittersweet as deftly as it might have.,Rotten
"They have instead chosen a low-key and realistic approach that is so effective that when I saw the film for the first time, I was convinced for the first 10 minutes or so that I was watching an actual documentary.",Fresh
"Easily one of the year's best, Sugar is an intelligent and sublimely moving film that should not be missed.",Fresh
The approach is flighty at best and a cinematic bait-and-switch at worst.,Rotten
"Algenis Perez Soto plays the character so openly, so naturally, that an interesting thing happens: Baseball is only the backdrop, not the subject. This is a wonderful film.",Fresh
"An authentic, timely ""immigrant experience"" tale about trying to score.",Fresh
[A] terrifically human account of a young Dominican pitcher's discomfiting odyssey from his tiny village to a major league training camp to A-ball in the American Midwest.,Fresh
"The film's strength is reportorial, sensitively exploring a theme that has grown ever more prominent with the globalization of sport.",Fresh
"This is a drama of shifting values and compromised ideals, arriving at a view of life that's wise, complicated, and tinged with melancholy.",Fresh
Sugar is a departure from movies of its kind in quietly observing that life is often a series of base hits rather than grand-slam homers. The film has few moments of high drama and the games played matter only in how they shape Soto's character.,Fresh
"Of course, calling a movie 'too humane' isn't really all that much of a complaint...",Fresh
"With all the scandals surrounding baseball lately, Sugar is so good that it reminds people that stories of drug-induced superstars are the exception and kids like Miguel ""Sugar"" Santos are far more common.",Fresh
"Please understand that I am not praising ""Sugar"" just because some scenes were filmed here in the Quad-Cities.",Fresh
A sports movie that transcends its genre.,Fresh
Anna Boden and Ryan Fleck's film is a modest but masterful triumph.,Fresh
"Sugar has its own knuckle curve - it takes familiar images of the U.S. and flips them, giving us an idea of how strange our country can look to an outsider.",Fresh
"Fleck and Boden probably will get better at making movies, but for now, they can get by with this: They are curious about what makes people tick, and they have a talent for making us curious, too.",Fresh
"With the moving, absorbing drama Sugar, Boden and Fleck not only avoid the sophomore slump, they demolish it, delivering a film of rare intelligence, beauty and compassion.",Fresh
"A story about expectations, the division of work and play, and the terrifying but terrific ability human beings have to change their minds.",Fresh
"Sugar is a subtly engaging film about a world -- indeed, a string of worlds -- that hums energetically all around us and yet remains invisible.",Fresh
the feeling of it when it's over is exhilaration at time spent with real characters placed in real situations.,Fresh
"This is a film that finds certain purity in disillusionment and freedom in failure. Which may not be sweet, but it is tasty.",Fresh
"A terrific film that's not just for sports fans. Written and directed by Anna Boden and Ryan Fleck, it's as insightful as it is entertaining.",Fresh
A penetrating exploration of the hardships that Dominican baseball recruits face in making to the major leagues.,Fresh
Dominican natives pursue their diamond dreams in the U.S.,Fresh
"It is a gently persuasive, bittersweet run around the base paths in the game of life.",Fresh
"That the movie manages to avoid some of the customary cliches and formulaic machinations of the sports drama genre makes the film rewarding, as do the performances by its mostly fresh-faced cast.",Fresh
"While it's interesting, it's never truly absorbing.",Rotten
"This sophomore effort from the writing and directing duo of Anna Boden and Ryan Fleck (""Half Nelson"") is not your typical sports movie, but rather focuses on the immigrant experience of a foreigner on a work visa to play minor league baseball.",Fresh
"Sugar is a baseball movie in the way that Macbeth is a play about kilts. The description is accurate as far as it goes, but it doesn't go nearly far enough.",Fresh
It resists cliche at every turn and puts something solid in its place: raw yet controlled observation that gives the film the form of a flexing muscle.,Fresh
"Naturalistic performances, even-handed characterisation and the utter eschewal of genre cliches ensure that this tale of a stranger in a strange land hits home.",Fresh
Sugar is a completely convincing character who inhabits what appears to be an utterly authentic world.,Fresh
"Like a slow curve ball, its journey unexpectedly going off course, Boden and Fleck deliver their magnificent take on the American dream by skewing it sideways.",Fresh
What's this? An inspirational sports flick whose every step doesn't lead up to the climactic Big Game in which the underdog hero must score that touchdown/hit that home run/kick that goal/deck that opponent?,Fresh
Sugar is a slow-burning exploration of the immigrant experience that grows more compelling as Miguel starts to realise he might not be good enough to realise his dream.,Fresh
"In 'Sugar', the pair skilfully dismantle the timeworn themes, characters and story patterns of the conventional sports movie and then reassemble them as a rich, socially astute realist drama.",Fresh
"As a sports movie the film perhaps lacks the pace and punch to capture the genre's traditional audience. But Sugar is much more than a sports movie. It is a picture of integrity, intelligence and empathy that studiously avoids clich√©.",Fresh
"Sugar is a revelation, not least in the way it ducks an onrush of cliche to expose the whole rags-to-riches mantra as a bright and shining lie.",Fresh
"Sugar, winningly played by the complete newcomer Soto, isn't a cut-out ingenu but a testy, competitive, driven but fallible person. The road he follows is modest, but the film is beautiful and searching in letting him find it for himself.",Fresh
"Poignant and beautifully written, directed and performed, Sugar confirms Boden and Fleck as eloquent chroniclers of the underbelly of the American dream.",Fresh
"Sugar might look like a typical underdog sports movie on the surface, but over the running time it transforms into something much more interesting.",Fresh
"The final reel veers away from the sports movie formula - and the narrative loses some of its drive - yet there's a believability about the twist. If anything, Sugar underlines the fact that this particular immigrant experiences is not all sweetness.",Fresh
"Sugar is a human story told with immense skill, right down to the deft transitions and the soft fuzz of the electronic score.",Fresh
"Great cinema can extend our own experience by making us understand how it must feel to be somebody else - and this is, in its gentle and unpretentious way, great cinema.",Fresh
"A compelling and compassionate stranger-in-a-strange-land drama, it's a film brimming with insight, integrity and life. I reckon we're looking at one of the films of 2009.",Fresh
"Sugar is dazzlingly free of message creep. We are perplexed, yet fully persuaded.",Fresh
The story's slow-burn never quite flares into dramatic wildfire.,Fresh
This masterfully pitched exercise in sombre revelation may frustrate sports fans looking for an easy hit.,Fresh
"Brilliantly directed, superbly written and thoroughly engaging drama that skilfully blends sports movies, immigration dramas and coming of age movies, while avoiding the usual cliches.",Fresh
A powerfully engaging coming-of-age immigration sports documentary-style drama. And this unpredictable genre mash-up is pure magic.,Fresh
"...an immigrant's song, a story about cultural dislocations and human connections that happens to be one of the year's best movies.",Fresh
"We're so used to sports movies hitting certain dramatic beats that when ""Sugar"" completely avoids them, it forces us to sit up and pay attention.",Fresh
Pays such attention to detail ... that it's easy to forget you're watching a work of fiction and not a documentary about a real-life star on the rise.,Fresh
"Sugar is a refined and appealing love letter to baseball, and a reminder of all that makes it matter.",Fresh
"Full of life, even sexy and at times bouncy (and with a fine score), Sugar is a lovely, moving treat... full of rich supporting characters.",Fresh
"Sugar showcases a lovely performance by Soto, a match for the modest, low-key filmmaking style of Boden and Fleck... [Blu-ray]",Fresh
Scarcely a manipulative or fake moment,Fresh
"Though a little long at two hours, Sugar is a treat for any serious student of baseball.",Fresh
"Sugar makes my top ten list of baseball films. It's not your typical sports film, it's emotionally honest, and it's delightfully detailed, yet subtle.",Fresh
"In a word, Sugar is extraordinary.",Fresh
"Not your usual film about chasing the American dream, Sugar gains mileage instead from a more sober brand of inspiration while imparting wisdom in the form of welcome reality checks.",Fresh
"At a time when sabermetrics break players down into pages of predictive statistics, Sugar delivers a potent reminder of off-the-field challenges that affect performance on the field.",Fresh
"Fresh perspectives offer fresh ideas, even if they don't result in a smile and a happy Frank Sinatra song about love.",Fresh
"Steroids enter the equation, but ""Sugar's"" narrative turns feel more generous than obvious - emphasizing baseball's calming, community ideas over its cult of personality. The gravity of Miguel's plight stays with you, but so does his eventual peace.",Fresh
"A portrait of an immigrant, a sports movie commentating on the machinations of American sport and a coming-of-age drama: Sugar is not short of subject matter.",Fresh
We begin to get the feeling that the United States of Baseball is somehow grander and more generous than the United States of America.,Fresh
"Follows its own path, defying stereotypes and avoiding just about every sports-movie clich√© and fish-out-of-water convention, all the way to the end.",Fresh
"You get the perfectly calibrated story of one young man's travels, not just to the United States from his tiny island country but to the land of expectations that come with adulthood.",Fresh
"I've watched thousands of baseball games and seen tons of baseball movies, but Sugar opened new doors of understanding and insight.",Fresh
"Anna Boden and Ryan Fleck, the makers of Half Nelson, return with another subtly observed drama about a character on the outskirts of mainstream America.",Fresh
"Sugar, a baseball movie, an immigrant parable and a thoroughly entertaining drama that accomplishes the seemingly impossible task of putting a fresh face on the fractured American Dream.",Fresh
"Not only have director-writers Anna Boden and Ryan Fleck crafted a poignant immigrant tale, they've made a sports saga rife with rare truths.",Fresh
"The camera is on Sugar the whole time, but the faux-documentary approach keeps him out of reach in all the ways that really matter.",Rotten
"To tell you what happens to him from here would be a tremendous disservice. We'll just say that, refreshingly, nothing about it is sickly sweet.",Fresh
Boden and Fleck are attentive to detail and the nuances of social interaction -- in the cornfields of Middle America as well as in the Dominican Republic. And Sugar is a thorny but endearing hero.,Fresh
"It is full of so much humor, grace, and unexpected detail, and arrives in such a truthful place, that in the end it's far more enthralling than the typical rags-to-riches tale one might have anticipated.",Fresh
A rich and moving reminder of the way professional sports aspirations can shape someone's destiny in the real world.,Fresh
This is a tragic sports movie that shies away from every element of tragedy.,Rotten
"As the film plays out its melancholy story, we realize that what we are watching is far rarer than the usual sports flick.",Fresh
"This captures many moving moments and atmospheres in the diverse settings, bu the narrative arc isn't quite as engaging as it could be.",Fresh
The problem is that it is incredibly tedious and at some point very uneventful.,Rotten
"A familiarity with baseball is probably crucial to getting the most out of this quiet, absorbing drama.",Fresh
"Just as Hoop Dreams had the urgency of great storytelling, Sugar exhibits the patience of the most penetrating documentary.",Fresh
The cinematic equivalent of an investigative Sports Illustrated two-parter.,Rotten
Sugar's personal achievement is uplifting-and it's also cause for celebration when artists create just for the love of the game.,Fresh
A raw and insightful film that will appeal to viewers who may or may not be sports fans.,Fresh
"Sugar is worth seeing not because it invalidates baseball's meritocracy, or because it makes us feel guilty for enjoying the national pastime, but because it shows us with empathy and insight how baseball players are more than what they do on the field.",Fresh
"Sugar is one smart, beautiful movie, and from where I stand, it is an instant classic with the guts and integrity to remain focused on a winning story about a flowering American-immigrant soul.",Fresh
"By refusing to ""win one for the Gipper"" or any of the other boring sporty standards, the directors have a lot to be proud of. By being a little bit bolder, however, they really could have hit it out of the park.",Fresh
"Writer-directors Anna Boden and Ryan Fleck could have created a clich√©-ridden film...But the pair (who also made the teacher drama Half Nelson), are more concerned with humanism than proving that dreams do come true.",Fresh
"A hopeful story, a heartwarming story, an entertaining story...",Fresh
"An exceedingly odd meeting of the minds (and bodies) occurs in Quid Pro Quo, a strikingly original and provocative first feature from scribe-helmer Carlos Brooks.",Fresh
"Has some pretty insightful things to say about the nature of being ""disabled,"" and it says them with a good deal of humor, style, and understanding.",Fresh
"Although not a perfect film, ""Quid Pro Quo"" is a highly crafted cinematic achievement that taps into its characters' subconscious with surgical precision and elegant assurance.",Fresh
"Not exactly Bunuel's differently abled erotica classic Tristana, it raises mystifying questions about disability as a state of mind. And whether or not the final clues to this mind over matter mystery reside in sex, shoes or tulips, hypochondriacs beware.",Fresh
The first half of Quid Pro Quo is among the most jaw-dropping things I've ever seen: Who knew there was a closeted subculture of people pretending to be paraplegics?,Fresh
"Like a fender-bender to David Cronenberg's Crash, Carlos Brooks' Quid Pro Quo is a tame, yet weird and wonderful love-letter to the walking wounded.",Fresh
"A bleakly humorous romantic character study, Quid Pro Quo is appealingly offbeat until its narrative takes a wayward detour into pat simplifications.",Rotten
"It certainly won't be everyone's cup of breakfast bitters, but you can't dismiss it nonchalantly.",Fresh
"Quid Pro Quo is a respectable feature-film debut for Mr. Brooks, and it remains reasonably thought-provoking without ever becoming emotionally absorbing.",Fresh
"Farmiga is captivating, Stahl less so -- although a bigger problem is writer/director Carlos Brooks's script, which sets up one story, then shifts gears into something more personal and psychologically specific.",Rotten
"It frustratingly refuses to go bonkers, but the film is a compelling sit, brought to life by two very crafty, pointed performances.",Fresh
"[Director] Brooks plunges into the thick of a largely unfamiliar subculture in Quid Pro Quo, but the journey involves a series of well-telegraphed twists and turns.",Rotten
"Might work if it was really about what it's really about, but its too-tricky script has too many paths that lead nowhere.",Rotten
"A finely observed, compelling drama with the creepy tinge of a thriller.",Fresh
Quid Pro Quo hovers in a noir-shaded twilight zone where repressed memories and guilt merge in an obsession with physical and emotional paralysis.,Rotten
The movie exerts a certain appeal without ever being convincing.,Fresh
This warped masochistic cousin to David Cronenberg's Crash - not to be confused with the Oscar winner of the same name -- is well worth seeing for Farmiga's stunning performance.,Fresh
"While a good director can spin a worthy movie from any subject, first-timer Carlos Brooks does surprisingly little with the jaw-dropper of a topic he chose.",Rotten
"This odd little fugue of a movie would be implausible, even laughable, if it weren't also marvelously played, visually composed and plotted with the utmost cunning.",Fresh
"If you were a fan of David Cronenberg's Crash, you might just be the target audience for Quid Pro Quo, a perverse psychological drama about able-bodied people who yearn to become disabled.",Rotten
The film is lightest on its feet when it shakes off the Red Shoe Diaries foreboding for moments of sly irony,Fresh
"Brooks has no idea how to pace his irritatingly giddy script, and the film feels overlong at 82 minutes.",Rotten
"I wanted Quid Pro Quo to develop into something at every turn, but it just never gels. It's a great 20-page short story that can't sustain 82 minutes of life on the big screen.",Rotten
"Brooks tiptoes into territory Luis Bunuel would have frolicked in, but he does so without the master surrealist's desire to outrage and confound his viewers.",Rotten
An obscure and terrifying mental disorder leads a reporter to the strangest and then the most terrifying story of his life. A neat film noir in a very modern setting amongst people who are not all there.,Fresh
"An outsider adventure strictly for the very open-minded, presenting the numbness of paralysis, ironically, as a potential source of paroxysms of pleasure.",Fresh
"Very deftly made, with some lovely cinematography and two quirky, engaging lead performances, it's a satisfying debut.",Fresh
"By far the movie's strong suit is Farmiga, who gives an astonishingly layered performance,",Fresh
"has the best ""middle"" I've seen in a long time",Fresh
"Strikingly original and spectacularly twisted, Quid Pro Quo is a gem. Two outstanding performances from Nick Stahl and Vera Farmiga provide riveting viewing",Fresh
"Its biggest mystery is how it was financed (by Texas trillionaire and Dallas Maverick owner Mark Cuban, no less) and selected for distribution.",Rotten
"In fact, ""Quid Pro Quo"" is not at all funny, merely occasionally sarcastic, its plot a succession of half-baked pop-psych speculations and its dialogue a glib sampling of sub-Diablo Cody incredibility",Rotten
"The film, intimately shot, sidesteps exploitative potential, and the finely tuned screenplay obscures its titular theme (colloquially translated ""tit for tat"") in multiple layers of narrative and a hit of noir.",Fresh
"An enthralling, erotically charged drama that marks the terrific debut of a director that is most certainly a talent to watch.",Fresh
The idea that a man would go so far over the death of a dog is a little hard to buy into.,Rotten
"Screenwriter Stephen Susco communicates with a wisdom beyond his years, injecting moments of profound introspection, both spoken and silent.",Fresh
"A well-made, neo-Western from Norwegian directors.",Fresh
A simple tale of how love and affection can sometimes inspire some of the nastiest human emotions imaginable.,Fresh
Cox's performance is more than enough to make the film worthwhile.,Fresh
"[Cox] inhabits Avery like a force of nature, drawing the audience to him and eliciting sympathy, even when his acts become morally dubious.",Fresh
Animal lovers may or may not like the way that the principal character gets revenge on a young man who killed his dog.,Fresh
"This movie has a humungous amount of problems, but I think that its absolute worst sin is that it'll make you think that the Jack Ketchum novel is some sort of Oprah's book of the month reject.",Rotten
"It's Brian Cox's powerful but low-key performance and an abiding respect for animals that can't defend themselves that invest this simple, straightforward narrative with an understated passion that is unforgettable.",Fresh
The film's climax ultimately seems less an example of its protagonist's irrational fury than of cockeyed storytelling.,Rotten
"This powerful, elemental drama hits all the buttons, probably to a fault, but it's helped along by fine performances all around.",Fresh
"The lesson to be taken away from Red is that, after some killin', the only thing that can make someone feel better is a new puppy.",Rotten
"Somewhere along the line someone should have taken a long, hard look at the excesses of the ending and changed course.",Rotten
Begins promisingly and then swerves into absurdity.,Rotten
"What makes this movie worth seeing is the acting, which is superb throughout.",Fresh
"Along with Shotgun Stories, Felon, and a few other recent 'indie pulps,' Red is part of a wave of low-budget genre films that turn injustice into an abstract force ripping decent folk apart.",Fresh
"Once Avery's mission assumes a Freudian dimension, the allegory loses its moral force and changes from a meditation on justice, power and inequality into a gory melodrama.",Rotten
"As Diesen fades out with a pat, artificially full-circle ending, we still appreciate how Red danced on the edge of the Movie-of-the-Week abyss and, thanks to Cox and the careful tending of Jack Ketchum(TM)s original novel, never fell in.",Fresh
A final quarter sentimental streak clashes with the masochistic pleasure of watching middle America close ranks against a victim who can't even bark in his own defense.,Fresh
"The movie's escalating series of tit-for-tat revenge ploys becomes a bit tedious even at 95 minutes, but Cox and a rich (if not always well-served) supporting cast that includes Tom Sizemore, Amanda Plummer, and Robert Englund keep it more than watchable.",Fresh
An elegant and deceptively straightforward dramatic thriller.,Fresh
A movie that's completely out of its tree.,Rotten
A low-key but compelling thriller that refuses to follow the traditional vengeance movie template.,Fresh
...a deliberately paced and downright thoughtful piece of work.,Fresh
The hero in Red doesn't want revenge. He wants an apology. This isn't your ordinary vigilante film.,Fresh
A vicious and brutal parable on human cruelty in the Jack Ketchum tradition...,Fresh
This beguiling wisp of a film charms and maddens in equal measure.,Fresh
A sobering and resonant tale.,Fresh
"Saffron Burrows is commanding as a distraught woman who finds a novel way to cope with tragedy, but the movie constantly subverts realistic detail with the fantastic in ways that are not dramatically satisfying.",Rotten
"To be brutally honest, there are many other things I would rather do with my final days than sit through this clichd mess all over again.",Rotten
"Without its weirdo visual flourishes, The Guitar would be completely reprehensible.",Rotten
"After spending 45 of the movie's 95 minutes in an orgy of consumerism, The Guitar suddenly speeds up its tempo and begins bombarding us with plot developments.",Rotten
"The movie has more clichd rebirths in mind, and you'll resent where it goes.",Rotten
"Written by Amos Poe and directed with moxie by Amy Redford, it's the ultimate movie about optimism.",Fresh
Interesting only in showing how tin-eared scriptwriting (by Amos Poe) can make 2008 New York City seem less familiar than 1952 Japan.,Rotten
You have to see it for yourself. It is that out-of-the-depths triumphant.,Fresh
"Some new directors often opt for minimalism in the hope that less is more. This doesn't work for Amy Redford (Robert's daughter), who transitions from actress to filmmaker with The Guitar.",Rotten
[A] bizarre art-house equiva lent of The Bucket Lisy.,Rotten
That the movie is easy on the eyes (Melody's fetching silhouette against those sunset river views) doesn't make it any less bogus.,Rotten
"I was seduced by Melody's story. Sucked in, enjoying Amy Redford's film despite myself.",Fresh
"A strong, kind-hearted start to a hopefully active career [for director Amy Redford].",Fresh
"An interesting premise is weakened by directorial callowness, tonal uncertainty and an unengaging central performance.",Rotten
"The Guitar is a lark, at best, but when Burrows' healing indulgence extends to taking on lovers of both sexes, its goofiness acquires a certain hedonistic charm.",Rotten
We've probably all wondered what we'd do if given a few short months to live and the premise of The Guitar takes one self indulgent option,Rotten
"Director John Hillcoat has performed an admirable job of bringing Cormac McCarthy's Pulitzer Prize-winning novel to the screen as an intact and haunting tale, even at the cost of sacrificing color, big scenes and standard Hollywood imagery.",Fresh
"There is so much in this picture, from dread, horror, to suspense, bitterly moving love, extraordinary, Oscar-worthy art direction and a desperate lead performance from Viggo Mortensen which perfectly illustrates the ... desperation of parental love.",Fresh
"Except for the physical aspects of this bleak odyssey by a father and son through a post-apocalyptic landscape, this long-delayed production falls dispiritingly short on every front.",Rotten
"Fortunately, the rumourmongers were wrong -- Hillcoat's vision is forthright and brutal.",Fresh
Very moving.,Fresh
"The two principals are superb, and the direction is resonant in its very restraint.",Fresh
Viggo Mortensen gives the performance of his career in the faithfully rendered film adaptation of Cormac McCarthy's heartbreaking apocalyptic novel The Road.,Fresh
A journey worth taking.,Fresh
Really pulls you in and sticks with you ... an incredibly strong piece of dramatic storytelling.,Fresh
"John Hillcoat's faithful, near-perfect adaptation beautifully captures McCarthy's synthesis of all-encompassing darkness and enduring hope.",Fresh
"Based on Cormac McCarthy's Pulitzer Prize-winning bestseller, The Road primarily transpires within a bleak, post-apocalyptic United States that's been decimated by an unnamed catastrophe -- with the bulk of the narrative following a father (Viggo Mortense",Fresh
It's hard not to divine that The Road will be receiving near universal acclaim and a truckload of Oscar noms.,Fresh
"Partly horror, partly sci-fi, mostly a family-bonding drama with stellar acting and patient action.",Fresh
"The Road evokes the images and the characters of Cormac McCarthy's novel. It is powerful, but for me lacks the same core of emotional feeling. I'm not sure this is any fault of the filmmakers.",Fresh
"pure, stripped-down bleakness, both in the desaturated drabness of its appearance and in the last-days essentialism of its themes.",Fresh
You won't find anything entertaining in The Road but maybe you'll find something else.,Fresh
"For all of its bleak content, the final equation proves surprisingly optimistic.",Fresh
"When a movie is bleak and depressing, it had better be damned good. The Road is damned bad.",Rotten
"Overall, THE ROAD is a horror movie in the truest sense -- it is about the horror of humanity, the horror of our legacy, the horror of what we might become.",Fresh
"And unlike the better-than-the-book No Country for Old Men, it's only as good as the book. I guess I'm saying there's enough blame to go around.",Rotten
"Despite the carps, a receptiveness to this material will pay off in tension and suspense, pushing you off The Road in a state of emotional exhaustion.",Fresh
"This relentlessly grim drama, which is tougher and more challenging than No Country for Old Men, deserves to be seen for the performance of Viggo Mortensen, who carries the film on his solid shoulders.",Fresh
"Evocative as it is, The Road comes up short, not because it's bleak but because it's monotonous, and because McCarthy's vision is finally as inflexible as his patriarchal hero's.",Rotten
One of the most important and moving films to come along in a long time.,Fresh
Hillcoat took it as far as he dared and created a beautiful suffering; a film that somehow manages to be both unwatchable and unmissable at the same time.,Fresh
A cinematic adaptation at once faithful and superior to its source material.,Fresh
Hillcoat has a way of undermining the earthy performances of his cast with overly refined images and obtrusive music.,Rotten
"""The Road"" is like the proverbial tree that falls in the forest when no human or animal is around. Whether or not it makes a sound is a moot point.",Rotten
"Let's be honest: go to see this apocalyptic drama, you're not going for a good time. This desperate and determined story of survival isn't the super effected tilt-a-whirl of, say, the hugely popular disaster epic, 2012.",Fresh
A heartbreaking and powerful adaptation of Cormac McCarthy's Pulitzer Prize-winning novel.,Fresh
"The movie The Road is nowhere close to its literary sire, but it's probably the best one could hope for from a movie version.",Fresh
"Emotionally affecting enough to please fans and the uninitiated alike, even if it falls short of its source material's profound beauty.",Fresh
"Adapting a masterpiece such as The Road is a thankless task, but the film doesn't work on its own merits.",Rotten
"[T]ruly great in the classical sense of the word, as grand as our most terrible fears and as wild as our most outlandish hopes and as intimate as being alive can be.",Fresh
The Road is effective -- and interesting as a comparison for those who loved the book.,Fresh
"It's never clear why the movie needed to be made, unless Hillcoat wanted to show that he could compete with Bela Tarr's 7 1/2 hour Satantango by having just as many endless shots of downtrodden people walking down a dirt road.",Rotten
It's a grueling experience that still allows for the viewer to survive with a self-centering hope. This is no Disney amusement ride.,Fresh
So intent on finding the shortest route to the essence of the book that it never discovers its own soul.,Rotten
Parental Content Review,Fresh
"It was unforgettable on the page, and it impresses equally, or at least it does so remarkably often, on screen.",Fresh
"What we've been given is no more than a reasonable facsimile, an honorable attempt at filming an unfilmable book.",Rotten
"While the film is not as resonant as the novel, it is an honorable adaptation, capturing the essence of the bond between father and son.",Fresh
"There is a small twinkle of hope in the end but getting there is tough, relentless going.",Fresh
The ending rings false; and the overbearingly sentimental music can't compensate for the lack of even harsh lyricism.,Rotten
"Wrenching, elegiac, but ultimately inspiring, this is a film that knows how to hold onto its own fire.",Fresh
"... what remains of 'The Road' is an honorable failure, given there was never any real hope of translating McCarthy's style-driven novel into film.",Rotten
"an interior novel that has been rendered on the screen with post apocalyptic drear and actors trying their damndest, but Hillcoat's episodic tale only strikes a real emotional chord once.",Rotten
A post-apocalyptic tale that is nothing more than an ad for patriarchy and dualistic thinking.,Rotten
"The picture glimpses what it might really be like if the earth went to hell. As shattering as the sights are, turning away is out of the question.",Fresh
"In adapting this harsh, unyielding book for the screen, Hillcoat and screenwriter Joe Penhall pull their punches the slightest degree and thus too much.",Rotten
"Hillcoat gives the film a remarkably evocative backdrop, but the drama lacks depth and dimension, and the scenes tend to blur together.",Fresh
"The Road has the signposts of an important film, but it lacks the diversions of an inviting trip.",Rotten
"When the most moving line in a movie is ""Do you eat people?"" you know you're in for a tough time.",Fresh
"I cannot think of another film this year that has stayed with me, its images of dread and fear -- and yes, perhaps hope -- kicking around like such a terrible dream.",Fresh
"The Road, for all its vivid desolation, remains a curiously unmoving experience.",Fresh
"delicate and indefinable, with only a thin reed of a story.",Fresh
"Viggo Mortensen plays ""The Man"" (in the anonymous, Everyman sense, not in the ""Stick it to the..."" blaxploitation sense). Charlize Theron is ""Wife."" Kodi Smit-McPhee is ""The Boy."" And I'm The Audience, and I'm annoyed.",Rotten
"For those who found the Coen Brothers' adaptation of Cormac McCarthy's No Country for Old Men too lighthearted, John Hillcoat's relentlessly faithful version of the author's post-apocalyptic Pulitzer-winning novel might hit the spot.",Fresh
"Already, Hillcoat's film has divided critics on the international festival circuit. The one constant is the praise, rightly so, for Mortensen.",Fresh
"one of the most riveting, emotionally draining, and strangely beautiful films of the decade.",Fresh
"Oppressively, but appropriately, bleak adaptation of Cormac McCarthy's end-of-the-world novel about a father and son wandering a post-apocalyptic landscape. Points for strong performances from the two leads and the film's unyielding view of the end of day",Fresh
"Like McCarthy's book, The Road is dark, bleak and nightmarish but also stirring and beautiful and optimistic: As long as life remains, the movie argues, there is always hope.",Fresh
"A grim, tedious slog that goes nowhere emotionally [and] never manages to be either viscerally affecting or intellectually insightful.",Rotten
"A film that takes a bleak, harrowing story and makes it tender and compelling...deserves to be in the Oscar hunt for the shattering performance by its star, Viggo Mortensen.",Fresh
"The apocalypse probably won't have a soundtrack, yet there's a pesky score during every heavy-handed emotional moment.",Rotten
I could watch my favorite stars gather supplies all day long.,Fresh
A powerful film adapted from Cormac McCarthy's powerful apocalyptic novel...One of the most faithful translations of a novel to cinema that I've ever seen.,Fresh
"The high-minded antithesis of 2012... The Road is mired in morning-after misery, set in a world where fear of a living hell is more reasonable than hope of heaven.",Rotten
"Mortensen and Smit-McPhee may deliver intense, often gut-wrenching performances, but their journey is too mysterious and soaked in one-note misery to keep you rapt.",Rotten
"Tedious, dull and anticlimactic despite decent performances and exquisite cinematography filled with bleak images. It's ultimately an underwhelming experience that lacks emotional resonance.",Rotten
"Hillcoat's noble effort ultimately falls under the category of things much better imagined than seen. Instead of The End of All That Is, this is, well, just a movie.",Fresh
This year's entry in the Movies You Admire and Respect but Don't Ever Want to Watch Again Sweepstakes.,Fresh
"The most arresting aspect of The Road is just how fully the filmmakers have realized this bleak, blighted landscape of a modern society reduced to savagery.",Fresh
"Mortensen has proven to be one of the best actors in the business, and The Road is his masterpiece.",Fresh
"(T)hanks to Hillcoat's reverence to the source material and his desire to visualize McCarthy's mind's eye Armageddon, we wind up with something so harsh it's almost unbearable.",Fresh
"The Road possesses undeniable sweep and a grim kind of grandeur, but it ultimately plays like a zombie movie with literary pretensions.",Rotten
"I'm not sure if The Road could ever have worked on the big screen, but I am sure that this version could be used to make that case.",Rotten
"Zombieland was the same movie with laughs, but if you take away the comedy, what is left? Nothing, on a vast scale.",Rotten
"Cormac McCarthy's Pulitzer Prize-winning, Oprah-endorsed, post-apocalyptic survivalist prose poem... was a quick, lacerating read. John Hillcoat's literal adaptation is, by contrast, a long, dull slog.",Rotten
"This adaptation of Cormac McCarthy's 2006 Pulitzer Prize-winning novel is intense and, yes, depressing -- and earns every minute that it rattles inside your head.",Fresh
"Unless you're far better at walling yourself off from identification than I am, you walk out in a state of untreated shock. Rather than thinking about the movie afterward, you wait for it to wear off.",Rotten
"The Road immerses us so completely in its world that it's as if it is teaching us, as well as the characters, a new way to think.",Fresh
"It seems a strange thing to say about one of the most depressing films ever offered as popular entertainment, but The Road is a beautiful movie.",Fresh
"My, but it's been a fine year for Armageddon.",Fresh
"Mortensen warms the film with his presence, creating a vivid portrait of a bereft man clinging to the one thing he has left.",Fresh
"There are still some things that magnificent prose can do that a movie, for all its stars and CGI, just can't. Director John Hillcoat's movie is, however, an admirable attempt.",Fresh
"The Road -- centered by Mortensen's typically physical but tempered performance -- is hard to watch. But it could have been much harder. Hillcoat isn't doing opera here, he's doing tragedy.",Fresh
"It'll leave you exhausted, emotionally spent and with much to ponder.",Fresh
"This is a willfully, skillfully crafted film with insufficient heart to the task it undertakes. It never fully connects us to love amid its ruins.",Rotten
"The Road, a tremulous heartbreaker onscreen, has successfully made the leap despite an unthinkable amount of fidelity.",Fresh
Hillcoat gives [the postapocalypse] an unnerving solidity by focusing on the drab details of survival and linking them to the more hellish aspects of modern American life.,Fresh
The film has pacing issues but it should win an award for casting a brilliant young actor (Smit-McPhee) to carry this heavy drama. He steals the film.,Fresh
Vividly atmospheric direction and performances that are packed with raw honesty.,Fresh
"Haunting, ominous and evocative, it's a cautionary, cryptic allegory about the indominable hope for survival, even in the face of unfathomable horror.",Fresh
Hillcoat's rendering of McCarthy's words can't be faulted for its visual replication of the author's grim picture of mankind's final days.,Fresh
"The Road can be a tough slog, but the journey is a rewarding one.",Fresh
"Breathtaking in the totality of its harrowing vision, The Road is an unflinching contemplation on the astonishing duality of the human animal.",Fresh
"This is a dramatic, slow moving Mad Max with a kid along for the awful ride. It's a survival tale, and The Road should be seen for those who want to keep carrying the fire.",Fresh
"Is the film too grim? Or not grim enough? In a perverse way, I fear it's both.",Fresh
"By only allowing us a peek at the characters' interior lives before we're forced to move on down that eternal Road is to deny this fascinating piece its full power. An emotional highway robbery, if you will.",Fresh
"Alas, this Road is long and hard, but it leads nowhere.",Rotten
"Movies like '2012' wreck the world in front of our eyes through long pageants of explosions. 'The Road,' however, deals with cataclysmic ruin in a far different and much more compelling manner.",Fresh
A nerve-wracking and emotional experience...as true to the book as it could have been without having narration the whole way through.,Fresh
The visions of the Pulitzer Prize-winning book I read were precisely what I saw on screen.,Fresh
"In this haunting portrait of America as no country for old men or young, Hillcoat -- through the artistry of Mortensen and Smit-McPhee -- carries the fire of our shared humanity and lets it burn bright and true.",Fresh
How could anything so bleak be so promising?,Fresh
"You hang on to yourself for dear life, resisting belief as best you can in the face of powerful acting, persuasive filmmaking and the perversely compelling certainty that nothing will turn out all right.",Fresh
Great junk like Resident Evil and passable schlock like 28 Weeks Later have more skill and integrity. Why would anyone want to make -- or watch -- this Hillcoat/McCarthy desolation except to feel fashionably cynical?,Rotten
"It hits a few tinny, sentimental notes. Still, I admire the craft and conviction of this film, and I was impressed enough by the look and the performances to recommend that you see it.",Fresh
"What's unnerving is that the end of the world was shot on location. Apparently, if you want to see doom, just go to New Orleans or Pittsburgh.",Fresh
The Road prompts us to treat each other with kindness and to savor 'small graces.' ... Can we carry the light and heat of grace when survival demands that we carry a loaded gun? That is the question.,Fresh
"It's fitting that The Road opens at Thanksgiving. It will thrill you, unsettle you, but mostly remind you that even in the darkest of times there is much to be thankful for.",Fresh
"Carved almost verbatim from Cormac McCarthy's compelling novel, The Road is a depressing, gut-wrenching journey that is strangely uplifting at its core.",Fresh
"In attempting to realize McCarthy's vision of the planet in chaos, Hillcoat delves so deeply into his source material that he loses sight of the audience.",Rotten
"'The Road' is a courageous road picture and an unnerving dystopian epic, but with great moments of horror, love, and adventure.",Fresh
"Hillcoat certainly provides the requisite seriousness, but what the movie lacks is an underlying sense of innocence, a sense that, however far humanity has sunk, there is at least some chance of rising again.",Rotten
One of the grimmest end-of-the-world movies in recent memory.,Fresh
"It's a beautiful, harrowing story and a good film. I'm just worried it's not good enough considering its potential.",Fresh
This film is worth seeing for the performances from Mortensen and gifted adolescent actor Smit-McPhee.,Fresh
The Road ends up being more gloomy than harrowing. That's probably good for your constitution but not so much for your viewing experience.,Fresh
A powerful and devastating adaptation of Cormac McCarthy's novel.,Fresh
"Filmed as if dictated by Jehovah but ultimately boasting only a fraction of the artistic value of, say, Terminator: Salvation",Rotten
"Hopelessly muddled narratively, with one foot trapped in a more conventional American Hollywood narrative, and the other rooted in a more esoteric European arthouse aesthetic.",Rotten
"For all the desperation and tragedy, then, the film offers a kind of heroism, set against a frankly grim but also frequently poetic backdrop.",Rotten
Watching McCarthy's story unfold is a lot like listening to a brooding musician hold down the lowest key on a piano for two unrelenting hours.,Rotten
"The end of civilization in The Road is ugly and terrifying, but that makes the father and son's hope and faith so much stronger.",Fresh
"The muffled air, the rumbling tectonic murmurs, the groaning and incessant tree deaths, sounds of other humans, all these sounds sell the monochromatic but still stunning images of a completely dying world",Fresh
"Like its protagonists, the movie is implacable and unyielding, and may very well break you down.",Fresh
"Grim beyond belief and almost beyond endurance, 'The Road' is one of the most depressing ""apocalypse"" movies ever made.",Fresh
What was poetic and spare on the page has become monotonous and oppressive on the screen.,Rotten
"The concussive soundscape rumbles like thunder in the distance. And the film's episodic terseness is the poetry of cataclysm, in a language that needs no translation.",Fresh
"Obviously, it's not really a pleasant cinematic experience, despite the quality of its filmmaking and performances. It's worthwhile for its character development and its examination of morality and survival behavior, though.",Fresh
A very fine film that somehow manages to attain only a fraction of the heart-rending power of its grim source.,Fresh
Mortensen comes through with another haunting performance that mixes the cerebral with the physical.,Fresh
"The Road is a heavy load to bare for the casual movie fan. Unless of course, that movie fan likes drinking with the lights off, full-moon Russian Roulette or confuses the Sunday funnies with the obituaries.",Fresh
"The Road... literalizes but doesn't flinch. It is brave in the dumb way brutes sometimes seem to be, as though it knows no alternative.",Fresh
"Instead of popcorn and soda, the concession stands ought to serve broken twigs and muddy water with this one.",Rotten
"An overall impressive adaptation that, while tough to recommend because of its oppressive mood, stays on the right path for the duration of its run.",Fresh
Grueling Road Worth Traveling.,Fresh
"Ultimately I think this is just one of those instances where nothing put upon the screen can compare to the original written word that inspired it, McCarthy's source material a masterpiece that's quite possibly impossible to adapt.",Rotten
"A long and winding, dark and depressing road but at the end strangely uplifting. The acting is excellent.",Fresh
"Its high-minded, this-is-good-for-you equation of bleakness with brilliance works against it a little, serving up many of the same allegorical ideas as a George Romero film.",Fresh
"One of the most chillingly effective visions of the world's end ever put on screen - and a heart-rending study of parenthood, to boot.",Fresh
"Hillcoat's movie is a resounding triumph. Stunning landscape photography sets the melancholy mood, and Nick Cave's wrenching score reinforces it. But it is the performances that ultimately hold the film together.",Fresh
"Haunting, harrowing yet profoundly enriching. The Road is the most powerful and moving post-apocalyptic film of the twenty-first century.",Fresh
"A Trojan-horse blockbuster that promises the wham bam of apocalypse while actually delivering the quiet pain of human intimacy, The Road might just be one of the most heartfelt end-of-the-world movies yet made.",Fresh
It is an inexpressibly painful subject and Hillcoat has brought it to the screen with great intelligence.,Fresh
This one-note exercise in neo-medieval moodiness eventually dissolves into that perennial and most corny of Hollywood tropes: the search for redemption. A disappointment.,Rotten
"Not merely bearable, but affirmative and life-enhancing.",Fresh
"The Road isn't flawless, it isn't quite the emotional masterpiece you want it to be, but it is both a worthy companion piece to the source material and, moreover, a dramatic slice of cinematic story telling in its own right.",Fresh
"Hillcoat's raw and sparing approach is sympathetic to the novel. Even after it's over, it continues to burn.",Fresh
"This is a superlative piece of film-making. Terse, raw and unadorned, there are no cheap tricks to devalue a story of unconditional love.",Fresh
"Isolation, desolation and the odd skirmish: this is Hillcoat's apocalypse, not Hollywood's, but it lacks McCarthy's power.",Fresh
"Ultimately, this bracingly austere film falls a little short of the greatness of the book, but it's still a terrifyingly effective warning that we squander the planet's resources at our peril.",Fresh
"Drab, virtually plot-free and aridly pointless, this road doesn't get anywhere.",Rotten
What might be the feelbad film of the year makes an early but convincing claim to be the film of 2010.,Fresh
This is a powerful movie that at the end packs an emotional punch to leave you reeling.,Fresh
"We come out humming the film's acting and production design, while wishing we could stop humming Nick Cave's music, which pulls out all the stops marked ""Miserere mei (popcorn version)"".",Fresh
"The Road offers an allegory of misery and dread that is crushing, not because it denies humanistic feeling but because it defies cinemagoing pleasure. You would have to be mad - or just morbidly depressed - to recommend it to anyone.",Rotten
John Hillcoat's impressive screen version is not without its flaws but it does capture the abject bleakness of McCarthy's vision in a way that feels like the cold chill of winter invading your very bones.,Fresh
"An unforgettable love story, an absorbing road movie, a searing examination of people pushed to the very limits and an ultimately uplifting celebration of the human spirit.",Fresh
"Like Mad Max on Mogadon, the film is enraptured with its own depressiveness, coming on like the worst New Year hangover you've ever had.",Rotten
"One of the best films this year (and last!). Bleak, painful, charged with emotion and philosophical questions about how far we have evolved from animals when our comforts are taken away. A must see.",Fresh
"A powerful, thought-provoking and frequently uncomfortable drama, but it's also one of the best films of the year.",Fresh
It's almost-but-not-quite as good as the 2006 classic post-disaster film Children Of Men - and that's good enough for me.,Fresh
"Mortenson's haunting, evocative turn has already been touted for an Oscar, but stealing the show is Smit-McPhee with a remarkable and totally believable performance.",Fresh
"It's one of that rare breed of remarkable films - like Mel Gibson's Apocalypto - that, once you've seen it, you would be quite happy never to see again. Then again, it's so good you won't need to.",Fresh
"Fans of No Country For Old Men may find the film insufficiently quirky (do not expect humour, not even the darkest kind), the decimated world created is wholly compelling and a submersive experience.",Fresh
"A horribly credible, chillingly beautiful and wholly uncompromising drama. It's the end of the world, all right, but no one feels in the least bit fine.",Fresh
"It's a grind. Each weary, rainy step is agony. Around every corner is more desolation. More destruction. More misery. On it goes until The Road finally hits a dead end.",Rotten
"Hillcoat succeeds in creating his unflinching apocalypse, while quietly shepherding his film towards a faint, fading mirage of hope.",Fresh
This is a film of many layers and one that champions goodness and a warm heart,Fresh
"Considering it's not so much what happens but how it happens, Hillcoat has made a dynamic film of great impact",Fresh
"The film is so beautiful. In this sort of stark, austere grim way it's incredibly beautiful.",Fresh
Despite the challenges of the book they have come up with a compelling film.,Fresh
"It calls on all of one's powers of emotional endurance but it rewards the brave. It is relentless but beautiful, harrowing but tender.",Fresh
"It's the end of the world as we know it and you won't feel fine, even though The Road is fine filmmaking.",Fresh
"It is at its best recasting the apocalypse as an inexorably personal experience, an element long lacking in this genre and one happily found here.",Fresh
"This expertly crafted ""road movie"" does provide, thanks to the director's brave commitment to realism, a poetic and intentionally devastating emotional viewing experience.",Fresh
"A bleak, depressing odyssey you can firmly admire and marvel at, even as it rips your heart out.",Fresh
Hillcoat wisely uses a low-key combination of location footage and CGIs to create a sad industrial wasteland that is more reminiscent of Tarkovsky's Stalker than Mad Max.,Fresh
"A soulful and savagely beautiful meditation on the end of the world, Australian director John Hillcoat adapts Cormac McCarthy's tale of despair and faith with great delicacy and care.",Fresh
Anyone looking for either an adventure or an engrossing rumination on life after The End will find it tough to see beyond the film's starkly rendered gloom.,Rotten
"Avoiding all the pit falls of the bleak genre, The Road is captivating and in the end inspiring, and though not a film for everyone, a great film for any who enjoy thoughtful, artful cinema.",Fresh
The Road is a haunting portrait of what it means to be a parent.,Fresh
When the world goes Boom! I want Viggo Mortensen to be my dad. Who better to keep your spirits up in the hideous post-apocalyptic after life as pictured here?,Fresh
The dull gray monotony of existence never looked as uninviting as it does in this film.,Rotten
"It's just a slow wander through wreckage, waiting for bad stuff to get worse.",Rotten
"In a post-Apocalypse world in which you can't tell the difference between good guys and bad guys, it's better to trust no one, and Man will do anything to protect Boy.",Fresh
"Um filme dif√≠cil e angustiante. (...) Mas, talvez mais surpreendente, representa uma experi√™ncia profundamente tocante.",Fresh
Shames most films with the audacity to consider themselves tearjerkers.,Fresh
"While identifying with characters in a bad situation is a movie must, drowning in their deep funk as much as they do, is a narrative no-no.",Rotten
"""The images are searing, but there's little for Hillcoat to bat around besides endless agony. The Road is glacial and precise, but rarely offers the viewer something to chew on besides utter finality.""",Rotten
"Has an interesting thesis about morality and humanity, but lacks complexity in its approach.",Rotten
...only half as traumatic as the Cormac McCarthy novel on which it's based - which of course means that it will still leave you a wreck.,Fresh
"Without watering down Cormac McCarthy's hangman prose, John Hillcoat's adaptation transcended sad, gray apocalypse tropes to become an unexpectedly uplifting parable about faith, kindness and family at world's end.",Fresh
This is a tough road to follow,Fresh
"Una pel√≠cula agobiante, notablemente realizada y narrada. Tan dura y desoladora como el futuro posible que describe.",Fresh
"Hillcoat does his best, and for the most part, he succeeds. The horrifically desolate landscape and the drab greys and cobalt blues of the scarred sky pervade every shot.",Fresh
Unpleasant post-apocalyptic drama.,Rotten
"The Road is a highly emotional, involving, palm-sweatingly tense movie that will scar you for life if you let it. Exhausting to watch but oddly exhilirating to experience, it's a film you'll watch once but will never forget.",Fresh
There's about as much action as My Dinner With Andre.,Rotten
"The Road is one of the year's strongest dramas. But it's no picnic, to say the least.",Fresh
"A remarkable, haunting picture worth multiple viewings.",Fresh
"The Road is a murky harbinger of our future, but perhaps more urgently, a cautionary tale clearly reflecting our present.",Fresh
"Even with the brief cameos by Robert Duvall and Guy Pearce, The Road doesn't meet expectations.",Rotten
"I'm not asking for the end of the world to be a thrill-ride, but maybe it could have been less of a meretricious trudge.",Rotten
"It wasn't fascinating at all. The movie looked like it cost $500 to make, excluding actors' salaries, which were worth another $500.",Rotten
"It's fascinating to see the world become an empty vessel, but all The Road pours back into it are hollow truisms.",Rotten
"I cannot say how faithful this is but, having read other McCarthy books, would say the novel probably repaid your attention with its astonishing prose. This, though, puts you through the wringer, but doesn't repay you in any way.",Rotten
"Hillcoat and cinematographer Javier Aguirresarobe have successfully recreated the barren, grey, burnt out landscape... Mortensen is admirable as the man journeying with his son and it's bleak in a way that Hollywood rarely dares to be.",Fresh
One of the more interesting films to come out in 2009.,Fresh
"The Road may appear - at face value at least - to be a muted, subdued and frankly rather quiet approximation of an Apocalypse. But it's precisely this that gives it so much power.",Fresh
"The opposite of escapist entertainment, this rugged and wearing screen experience is tough, uncompromising stuff.",Fresh
"Somehow I am captivated by what I see in 'The Road', John Hillcoat's post-apocalyptic drama adapted from Cormac McCarthy's work. [Full review in Spanish]",Fresh
"G-Force has a script on autopilot, assuming that any old assortment of fart jokes, cheesy one-liners, and chase scenes will be enough to appease tots.",Rotten
"If what you need is a 90-minute baby sitter, or something that will put a smile on your kid's face, you could do worse than G-Force, but don't expect to be blown away yourself.",Rotten
"It is childish and inane valuing style over anything slightly substantive, playing to such a lowest common denominator it almost can't help but become a box office smash.",Rotten
"This is a stupid, lazy, dully designed and messily executed piece of junk that will have little kids and parents alike squirming in their seats out of sheer boredom.",Rotten
"just tries too hard, and it shows",Rotten
"The first 3-D movie from Jerry Bruckheimer, the last producer you'd think of whose pictures needed to be more in-your-face.",Rotten
"Top voice talent and good 3D computer graphics cannot make up for the fact that this film is utterly synthetic as well as crass, loud, and vulgar.",Rotten
"Galifianakis's comedy thrives on risk. In G-Force, he does the most subversive thing possible in a big budget PG picture: he plays it straight.",Fresh
"Parents already in dread of taking their children to this 3-D kids' movie by uber-producer Jerry Bruckheimer will find much to appreciate, though G-Force is lots of fun all around.",Fresh
A dispiriting primer on the low regard Hollywood has for the intelligence and curiosity of children -- and the time and money of their parents -- G-Force is an aggressively stupid entry in the family-adventure genre from Jerry Bruckheimer.,Rotten
Just about the only folks likely to find this humdrum hybrid of Mission: Impossible and The Wind in the Willows worthy for consideration are non-discriminating pip-squeaks happy to watch rodents rappelling walls and scampering along air ducts.,Rotten
Its prime directive is to inculcate young viewers with the gee-whiz tropes of producer Jerry Bruckheimer's teen-oriented fare.,Rotten
Do what you must to ensure that somebody else ferries your kids to this dud. Thank me later.,Rotten
Most depressing about G-Force is the talent wasted in the name of family entertainment.,Rotten
"Longtime visual effects supervisor Hoyt Yeatman Jr., in his feature directing debut, displays ample credentials for action and memorable setpieces.",Fresh
"G-Force represents an inconceivably tragic waste of a brilliant idea. Frankly, if you can't squeeze a decent movie out of talking 3-D superagent guinea pigs, you may as well throw in the towel and consider a career in insurance.",Rotten
"The worst Walt Disney Pictures release in a decade. To describe this chaotic, charmless, pop culture-centric product as completely and utterly excruciating is almost too kind a criticism.",Rotten
"A 3D ball of energy, but its furry characters are flatly run-of-the-treadmill.",Rotten
It's more fun than it should be.,Fresh
It will possibly be enjoyed by children of all ages.,Rotten
"It's super-intelligent guinea pigs who update their Facebook pages, know how to hack computers, and dodge fireballs. It hardly needs gravitas to provide a full course cinematic meal.",Rotten
"A better action movie than Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen, but that's like raving that sandwiches taste better than the bottom of your shoe.",Rotten
Bruckheimer and his crew should have imagined material that's suited for more than the bottom of a cage.,Rotten
"G-Force is short on wit, characterization and logic, but the car chases sure are breathtaking and just about everything blows up real good while the heroes run from the fireballs in slow motion.",Fresh
G-Force is everything I wished a Disney film could have been in the 1970s. What's so wrong about getting all giddy about it as a kid in my 30s?,Fresh
Producer Bruckheimer and...director...Hoyt H. Yeatman Jr. see no stylistic difference between the frenetic derring-do of G-Force and the atmosphere of such Bruckheimer hits as Con Air or The Rock.,Rotten
"What happens when Disney meets Jerry Bruckheimer? You get a whole new kind of rodent, but not necessarily a better one.",Rotten
"If you know a 7-year-old who's still angry he wasn't allowed to see Transformers, G-Force is sure to make him feel better. But other than him, it's hard to say who this abrasive comedy is meant to charm.",Rotten
G-Force is fast and funny and bound to appeal to kids.,Fresh
"A lot of resources went into making G-Force -- a lot of talent, a lot of money, a lot of marketing -- and it doesn't have much to show for it, not even some half-way imaginative 3-D gimmickry.",Rotten
The single most terrifying moment is hearing the world will be destroyed in 30 minutes. Therein lies the possibility that the film will drag on for another half hour.,Rotten
"G-Force is bright and funny, but surprisingly, it's more of an adventure film than a comedy.",Rotten
"Pointing out G-Force's plot holes would be redundant; it's more hole than plot, and more videogame commercial and exhausted-old-trope clearinghouse than film.",Rotten
The rodents carry the picture off in their little furry paws and this one is sure to entertain youngsters -- no matter how you look at it.,Fresh
"G-Force is unlikely to keep anyone older than 10 on the edge of his seat, and the bathroom humor may annoy adults.",Rotten
"For pure family fun in the middle of summer the often hilarious G-Force has it all: action, laughs and heart.",Fresh
G-Force is painfully bad and completely unfunny.,Rotten
G-Force is not completely awful although it dips its toes into the easy territory of potty humor too many times to be forgiven.,Rotten
"Unimaginatively, boringly bland without much to make you excited or angry about seeing it.",Rotten
There's nothing wrong with G-Force that John Lasseter couldn't fix.,Rotten
"Kids like to see something new when they head to the theater, something they can talk about on the playground. ""Remember when THAT happened?"" And I really feel that G-Force delivers in that department.",Fresh
Parental Content Review,Rotten
"Plot wise, well, G-Force doesn't really have one, but it's a film about rodents -- however, I could tell more interesting stories about New York City rodents terrorizing Manhattan on the daily than this vermin tale.",Rotten
"It's the template for either a video game or a Disney theme park ride, or perhaps both.",Rotten
"The digital hijinx aren't great. And despite a committed voice cast that includes two Oscar winners, the jokes aren't all that either.",Rotten
"On an adult fun meter, it would rate somewhere between a parent-teacher meeting and a trip to the orthodontist to outfit your kid with braces.",Rotten
It's a shame that the heart of the story doesn't beat strongly enough to match the visual invention onscreen.,Rotten
A harmless and good-natured family flick that unfortunately relies so much on its central conceit that it forgets to do anything else.,Rotten
"G-Force is being shown in both 2-D and digital 3-D formats. I saw it in 2-D, and that's the preferred format because it's one less dimension for the movie to suck in.",Rotten
Flashy - with a high-octane frenetic - aimed at a small-fry audience.,Rotten
Most youngsters at the screening I attended were not amused -- not even by the usually giggle-evoking flatulence scenes.,Rotten
3-D adventure is funny ... if you're a first grader.,Rotten
"I don't think kids will find it funny, [and] their parents will find it unbearable.",Rotten
It just didn't come together.,Rotten
"Blame it on Alvin and the Chipmunks. Cute, furry, and talking, CGI rodents are apparently now the rage, much to the chagrin of anyone over 12.",Rotten
"The best original blockbuster of the summer. Just to clarify that demonstrative statement, Star Trek was a reboot/re-imagining/sequel. (500) Days of Summer isn't a blockbuster. It is still better than the other sequel blockbusters.",Fresh
"Have you ever wondered what a Jerry Bruckheimer-produced talking-animal movie would be like? Me, neither. But here's the answer.",Fresh
"Really there's no reason to see this but if you really need to satisfy your guinea pig fix, hit the local pet store. It's cheaper and far more entertaining.",Rotten
"Though the film as a whole delivers ample thrills, it does lag occasionally and is encumbered by bland voiceovers and a lack of laughs",Rotten
"Technically accomplished holiday fun to while away a wet afternoon with the sprogs, G-Force is exciting while it lasts, but about as memorable as the bucket of over-priced popcorn.",Fresh
Imagine ordering a Diet Coke only to be handed a formula on a piece of paper and you have some idea of what watching G-Force is like.,Rotten
There is a distinct pet-shop whiff coming off this weirdly soulless and not especially funny or exciting family comedy from Disney about guinea pigs.,Rotten
"The story feels thin and faintly incoherent, the action is loud and relentless. A milder version of many other Bruckheimer films, then - which doesn't mean kids won't love it.",Rotten
Nowhere near the originality of anything from Pixar.,Rotten
"Without a strong villain, a charismatic hero or a clear quest, it's all just a pointless frenzy, an exercise in going nowhere fast. A bit like a hamster on a wheel.",Rotten
"A slick slice of efficient family entertainment, but lacking the inspiration to turn in into something special.",Fresh
"G-Force excels visually, with the cuddly critters being particularly impressive and the action sequences colourful, vibrant and effectively assembled.",Fresh
This Jerry Bruckheimer production is a surprisingly light-footed caper for cinema's reigning king of bombast.,Fresh
This is actually great (if ultimately silly and slightly cheesy) fun with quite a few nice sly digs at the genre that is trying to snuggle up to.,Fresh
This is not a movie for Hamstered intellectuals. Just imagine how Alvin And the Chipmunks might have turned out if it had been directed by Michael Bay.,Rotten
"The plot lurches joylessly from A to B, while the bored-sounding voice cast - Nicolas Cage, Penlope Cruz, Sam Rockwell - might have delivered their dialogue down a phone line.",Rotten
Kids will have a fur-ball watching this part-computer generated part-live action movie.,Fresh
"Maybe for today's computer-gaming sprogs, speed, violence and animation (in all senses) are enough.",Rotten
"One or two of the ideas are actually not bad - there's a rather cute joke about a mole, for instance - but for the most part, it's like running on a wheel.",Rotten
The action scenes are much more impressive than the predictable plot.,Rotten
"Guaranteed non-stop, gung-ho action plugged directly into your synapses.",Fresh
"Hugely enjoyable, fast-paced action-adventure with a witty script, likeable characters, great action sequences and terrific special effects.",Fresh
This rollicking action romp has all of the chase scenes and car crashes you expect from a Jerry Bruckheimer movie,Fresh
G-Force is a high-octane action movie for kids about a group of secret agent talking guinea pigs. The 3D is the best use of the technology in a movie this year and the action jumps from the big screen.,Fresh
"A bland distraction for the school holidays and nothing more, the now-ubiquitous 3D version isn't any better.",Rotten
Anybody who wants to go to a movie about talking secret-agent guinea pigs is probably too young to read this review.,Rotten
"The maestro of mayhem, Jerry Bruckheimer, does a kids movie.",Rotten
"When I review movies, I ask myself... ""does the movie do what it set out to do?"" G-Force set out to be an entertaining family movie that makes money. On that basis, G-Force succeeds.",Fresh
"The CGI guinea pigs are startlingly realistic-looking... which will charm kids, and the whiz-bang nonsense they get up to... is exactly the stuff of silly, entertaining moviegoing.",Fresh
Action and animals make good entertainment for kids and so-so entertainment for adults.,Rotten
"1 Plexiglas ball sporting 1 hamster was fine for Disney's Bolt. Along comes Bruckheimer -- now it's 3 Plexiglas balls with 4 hamsters, er, guinea pigs, and 1 Transformer. Seems he's hell bent on excess.",Rotten
"Obtain a human-sized version of a hamster wheel, then spend a couple of hours scurrying around inside it, and you'll have had an experience far more varied and stimulating than what's on offer here.",Rotten
"The animals seem more real than the humans, but the comedy is overly cute and the tone forced.",Rotten
"Not even remotely as bad as it could have been. Because, let's call a spade a spade: ""sentient guinea pig spies"" could easily have been just about the worst movie ever made.",Rotten
G-Force's dedication to egregious stereotypes is hackneyed and indefensible: this is how racism lives on.,Rotten
Guided by the principle that action movies have become generic that anybody can be plugged into the hero role and the results would be no different than if Arnold Schwarzenegger or Bruce Willis was the star.,Rotten
"For a 3D movie, G-Force falls very flat.",Rotten
"It wasn't a horrible movie, but I could have done without the fart jokes, really. Overall, it was just a mediocre kids movie that you can toss in the pile with all the rest.",Rotten
Disney [hates you and] wants your money.,Rotten
The worst thing about G-Force isn't that the plot is so formulaic that the entire movie can be divined from the first 20 minutes or that it's not particularly funny.,Rotten
Adults without kids may find their minds wandering even with the brief run time and those 3-D visuals.,Rotten
Believe in yourself is the motto of this sweetly madcap and amusing family adventure in which talking guinea-pigs turn the world upside down in order to save it. The execution is inventive and the cast works well.,Fresh
"Sometimes those aren't choc-covered sultanas in your hand after all, and G-Force is one of those times.",Rotten
"Billed as children's fare, G-Force's incessant action provides trainer wheels for youngsters soon to grow into the teens who have made Bruckheimer's live-action films such moneyspinners.",Rotten
The joke of cute animals hacking into mainframes and dodging explosions may not be enough to sustain a movie.,Rotten
click for full review,Rotten
"It is suitable for kids, and parents won't have to suffer much if they accompany the kids.",Fresh
"The voice actors are accomplished but the fussy story is strictly for the tykes and teens, even if the writers work in a sexy tease in gopher fur, that tramp.",Rotten
"When they're not risking their lives with exciting spy maneuvers, Blaster works out to Lady Gaga and Juarez updates her Facebook page. Okay, so maybe G-Force is just a tad self-consciously 'hip.' [Blu-ray]",Rotten
...an utterly worthless (and frequently unwatchable) piece of work.,Rotten
For older viewers the jokes struggles to find a pay off and the frequent potty humour will even grow tiresome for the younger audience.,Rotten
Critic: Was there too many poo jokes? 9 y.o.: Mmmm...no.,Rotten
Possibly the first movie to imagine -- in 3D! -- the comedic crime-fighting possibilities of small mammals that usually spend their days on hamster wheels.,Rotten
Several fellow G-Force sufferers likened the 3-D-rendered inanity to Idiocracy's Ass: The Movie. But that's an insult to a good backside.,Rotten
"For its intended audience, G-Force is a winner. Only a shopworn plot keeps it from being a solid seven.",Rotten
"... G-Force tries to captivate audiences, with mixed results. [Full review in Spanish]",Rotten
"Everything, from the writing to the score to the irritatingly plain cinematography is as generic as it gets.",Rotten
"Features a stellar cast, but it's never clear why because none of the vocal work is remotely demanding.",Rotten
"The promising intrigue of a husband's bullheaded obsession with his wife's lover falls flat in The Other Man, directed with an indifferent hand by Richard Eyre.",Rotten
Richard Eyre is fast becoming the new master of unhealthy obsession.,Fresh
Seldom has such great star power been marshaled in the service of a sillier movie than The Other Man.,Rotten
...pretty much cements Richard Eyre's status as a high-brow purveyor of trashy fare...,Fresh
"The tone is too uneven for us to get on board. And there are a couple of major plot points that are badly mishandled, leaving us feeling cheated.",Rotten
"Good actors (including Liam Neeson and Laura Linney) are wasted in Eyre's new film, which is neither effective as anatomy of a troubled marriage nor satisfying as a Hitchcockian thriller about a missing wife.",Rotten
It hurts to see a terrific cast (including the lovely and intelligent young Irish actress Romola Garai as the couple's quietly seething daughter) squandered on such dreary filmmaking.,Rotten
"The Other Man is self-conscious, overproduced, overacted Euro-marital hoo-ha.",Rotten
"As the pathetic, decent lothario, Banderas lacks sexual threat just as the script's various miscommunications lack Pinter menace. Neeson is too rough-hewn for the conflicted cuckold.",Rotten
"The screen version of Bernhard Schlink's short story The Other Man does not deliver. The secret at the heart of the film, after all the fractured narrative convolutions, is anti-climactic, and the conclusion is strained and awkward.",Rotten
The film is filled with good-on-paper moments that build up and slowly tighten like a knot but usually end in a whimper.,Rotten
"plays like a bleary, wandering dream.",Rotten
"If you like being manipulated by top-notch actors, you'll have a blast here. Otherwise you might lose your patience. I didn't.",Fresh
"The Other Man feels like a movie that focuses on the hole, instead of the doughnut.",Rotten
"Near the end, Peter issues this verdict on his romantic rival, ""Appalling...but also rather wonderful."" Applied to the film itself, he's half right.",Rotten
A supposedly grown-up drama like The Other Man ought to have scruples about where it plans to take you. Trickiness for its own sake is simply a cheat.,Rotten
It's a decent adult drama that should keep you guessing.,Fresh
An oddly affecting drama offers much food for thought on the after-effects of adultery and the toxin that can wither our soul when we are overtaken by jealousy.,Fresh
"The sexual temperature remains a safe, nap-inducing 98.6.",Rotten
Can you believe that a guy who once played Oskar Schindler and a woman who was Abigail Adams can go slumming in a less-than-appealing soap?,Rotten
"A contrived, poorly crafted, sophomoric and bland thriller that can't even be saved by its stellar cast.",Rotten
"Stagy to a fault, and painfully uneventful, ""The Other Man"" suffocates from the pitiable writing at hand.",Rotten
A skewed psychological thriller revolving around the many forms of betrayal.,Fresh
"Despite the cast, which is very good, you never feel like they're really taking on a life of their own.",Rotten
It owes its air of mystery to a piece of narrative trickery that's both obnoxiously manipulative and insultingly obvious.,Rotten
"Despite the gimlet eye of Richard Eyre, former director of England's Royal National Theatre, and the top-echelon talents of an impressive cast, a dreary, disabled disaster called The Other Man drops dead at the starting gate.",Rotten
"The result is B-grade cheese. The only genuine mystery, for me, is why such a fine cast signed on for such a witless movie.",Rotten
Everyone seems as if they're going through the motions.,Rotten
"It was directed by British theater director Richard Eyre, who knows how to line up the shots but not how to make us feel the compulsive hunger that drives Peter to the brink of a very tidy, stiff-upper-lip breakdown.",Rotten
"Before long, the characters, which director Richard Eyre adapted from a Bernhard Schlink short story, cease to be people and start to become devices.",Rotten
A turgid tale of adultery among the rich and boring.,Rotten
"Neeson, in particular, has to rumble through the movie behaving in a way consistent with the ending and comes off as far over the top in the process.",Rotten
"Its plotting leans more toward silly, soap opera-ish machinations, and while Banderas is as charming as ever, there are a couple of crucial bits of miscasting.",Rotten
"Strangely inhospitable, perhaps better appreciated three margaritas into a Sunday afternoon Lifetime film festival than a critical Friday night rental.",Rotten
A good character study lost in the haze of bad thriller gimmickry.,Rotten
A manipulative bore of a film. Liam Neeson is better than this and so are you.,Rotten
"For all its luscious period trappings and Keira Knightley's spirited take on the title role, Saul Dibb's handsome biopic reveals little about how Georgiana Spencer Cavendish became one of 18th-century London's most celebrated and influential aristocrats.",Rotten
Solid but distant melodrama about the flamboyant 18th century Duchess of Devonshire.,Fresh
"It could have been an intriguing, poignant saga of a modern marriage and extraordinary femme, but what we get is a trashy melodrama that can't decide how sensationalistic to be",Rotten
"Has riveting parallels with much more recent British royal family history. It's also an entertaining, emotional drama.",Fresh
"Ralph Fiennes steals it as the dour duke in a splendid under-performance. His ""Please put Her Grace's hair out"" when his wife's wig catches alight at a party is perfectly done.",Fresh
The Duchess is an emotionally engaging drama with a terrific central performance from Keira Knightley. Recommended.,Fresh
"He has tried to make Georgiana's quest for independence - her attempt to gain power via the media and the Whigs - just as gritty. Against the odds, he mostly succeeds.",Fresh
You'll find yourself less fixated on inner turmoil than whether you could feasibly slip a cocktail sausage between her perma-pouting lips.,Rotten
Can we not just enjoy what's on the screen without being spoon-fed a specious modern analogy? Dibb and his team - especial plaudits to Michael Carlin's production design and Michael O'Connor's costumes - have worked honourably to persuade us that we can.,Fresh
"""Banality of banalities, all is banality,"" saith the critic emerging from The Duchess as he hums the locations, wigs and furniture.",Rotten
For period drama fans there is enough high-powered bed-hopping and elegant corridor-stomping to keep them entertained.,Fresh
"The Duchess lacks the high romance of Pride And Prejudice and the tragic depth of Atonement, it is a decent example of English heritage cinema.",Fresh
The main event here is frock porn.,Rotten
"From ballrooms to bedrooms, we've seen it all before. And while familiarity doesn't necessarily breed contempt, it does have a habit of nudging the snooze button.",Rotten
"There is, however, much to enjoy. The cinematography, settings and costumes are glorious. Knightley gives a nuanced and often very moving performance, although Georgiana's love affair with the politician Charles Grey (Dominic Cooper) is remarkably lacking",Fresh
"Dibb's movie looks good, but there is something exasperatingly bland and slow-moving at all times. Unlike the heroine, he never takes much of a risk.",Rotten
"For beneath the hype and tabloid traction, the movie is dramatically flaccid.",Rotten
"A guilty pleasure. Less historical drama, more high-class soap opera.",Fresh
"He's also helped enormously by a mature, restrained portrayal from Knightley, a masterclass in passive aggression from Fiennes and a performance of tender seduction from Atwell.",Fresh
"For Knightley the part fits like a corset - it's an enigmatic, free-spirited turn and a role she'll be remembered for, probably her best role to date in a film not directed by Joe Wright.",Fresh
"Its real tragedy is that it never lets gain an understanding of that woman, and thus, in the end is little more than yet another fluff period drama with some nice costumes.",Rotten
"Saul Dibb's foamy adaptation of Amanda Foreman's ""Georgiana, Duchess of Devonshire"" focuses its soft soap attention so much on its leading lady's personal struggles that it all but leaves out the story's broiling 18th century political and social context",Rotten
Lovers of sumptuous photography and dazzling costumes will be much pleased: those who want more discussions of politics might be otherwise.,Fresh
"Although it skims the surface, The Duchess is an uncommonly well-crafted historical feminist tearjerker -- both anti-patriarchal and a monument to motherhood.",Fresh
"In the hands of a filmmaker with an actual point of view--Sally Potter, say, or Mike Leigh--this could be a potentially inflammatory tale. But with TV vet Saul Dibb at the helm, it's just a story about a woman who makes one mistake after another.",Rotten

"Knightley does the best she can to enliven such thin Masterpiece Theatre material, but eventually, the sheer emptiness of the pageantry wears her -- and us -- out.",Rotten
It has impeccable production values but feels like a Masterpiece Theater production of a Harlequin romance novel.,Rotten
It looks like outtakes from the nauseating bubble-gum fantasy Marie Antoinette.,Rotten
Knightley's star magic is her ability to express unhappiness as an erotic tonic.,Fresh

The Duchess is the best women's movie of the summer. Don't get too excited.,Rotten
A heart-affecting drama about a beautiful 18th century woman imprisoned in a cage of wealth and privilege.,Fresh
Just a handsomely appointed but lugubrious period soap opera centered on one of the distant ancestors of the so-called 'People's Princess.',Rotten
'The Duchess' is worth seeing if only for the magnificent costumes and sets.,Fresh
"A worthwhile addition to a genre that's been driven into the ground by weaker filmmakers who know where to rent the costumes, but don't understand the importance of storytelling.",Fresh

Princess Di deserves livelier revisionism.,Rotten
"It's a gorgeous production that boasts a beautiful leading lady, handsome locations (nicely captured by cinematographer Gyula Pados), drop-dead costume design and the standard-issue tropes of a PG-13 rated bodice ripper.",Fresh
Fiennes and Knightley are exceptional in their roles and Dibb proves himself ably in his first big-budget flick.,Fresh
Knightley is up to the task. Her Georgiana is history with a human face.,Fresh
"Things unfold as neatly, and slowly, as a minuet, but there's none of the messiness of life. And that's a shame.",Rotten
Knightley is a paper doll around whom the movie wraps hoop skirts and 21st century victimology.,Rotten
"Thanks to Fiennes, we come to understand the enigmatic duke as the immovable object deeply perplexed at having to contend with the unstoppable force that is his wife. It is a quietly complex performance almost beyond words.",Fresh

"Human desire hasn't changed much in 300 years, it would seem.",Fresh
Period drama delves into some heavy themes.,Fresh
"With its seductive period settings, glorious costumes and the stellar pairing of Keira Knightley and Ralph Fiennes, it is difficult to see how The Duchess could fail to stir significant interest.",Fresh

"The Duchess is an overstuffed, intellectually underbaked portrait of a poor little rich girl.",Rotten
"Nice try, but the contemporary parallels are just an empty echo.",Rotten
"Focusing on the costumes and frippery, rather than the inherent drama of Georgiana Spencer's dilemma, diminishes its impact.",Rotten
"a plaster cast of a movie. All the form of a cinematic event with none of the color, it turns a life that was fascinating into a film that is merely interesting",Fresh
"Not just another royal goddess in a gilded cage costume drama, the film couldn't be more current now, when women bidding for the highest political offices are told to go home and take care of their kids or iron male shirts. Sexual subversion in corsets.",Fresh

It's elegantly mounted and never dull -- and always easy on the eyes.,Fresh
"...a sumptuous period piece, well acted amidst stunning production design and costuming. Here's hoping those intrigued by the film's heroine will be inspired to read ""Georgiana, Duchess of Devonshire.""",Fresh
"Though screenwriter Jeffrey Hatcher has stuffed plenty of high-octane incidents into his script, none of them really register.",Rotten
"All the tawdry behind-closed-doors shenanigans of a daytime talk show, but none of the excitement. It's as if the characters are as bored as we are.",Rotten
Georgiana seems to get dumber as the years go on instead of learning how to play the game. Blame the hats and rent Atonement.,Rotten
"There is nothing in ""The Duchess"" that hasn't been seen in the countless number of historical melodramas that crop up at awards season every year.",Rotten
"The Duchess fails to define either the personal or political dramas in an exciting way. It's a costume drama that gets the costumes right, but not the drama.",Rotten
"While I much liked The Duchess, this portrait feels unfinished.",Fresh
"The Duchess is a handsome historical film, impeccably mounted, gowned, wigged and feathered.",Fresh

Beguiling.,Fresh
"Knightley doesn't carry the film, which wouldn't work without Ralph Fiennes' perfectly calibrated performance.",Fresh
"It's unfortunate that the movie tries to make so many oblique comparisons to more modern tragedy (paparazzi with sketchbooks; yes, we get it!), since Georgiana's life seems fascinating enough on its own.",Fresh
"There's nothing here to show us what a remarkable woman Georgiana was, if indeed she was at all.",Rotten
It isn't just eye candy; there's an active intelligence behind this design.,Fresh
"Though extravagantly pretty, The Duchess still manages to be a costume drama in which the drama survives the costumes.",Fresh
It's easy to joke about Knightley's fondness for period dramas. But we shouldn't underestimate her ability to channel the historic and modern into one compelling figure -- or her grasp of the power of dress-up to free performance.,Fresh
"I'm not sure why The Duchess doesn't wholly succeed, because the pieces are all there and they're very watchable.",Rotten
"Sure, The Duchess is a lavish exercise in style over substance, but it's a well-crafted, superbly acted one.",Fresh
This is scandal-mongering fun that also lays bare the deforming power of the male aristocracy.,Fresh
"[Viewers] may wish to heed the marital advice Georgiana's mother offers early in the film: 'Equip yourself with patience, fortitude, and resignation.'",Rotten
"The Duchess is this season's ""painted cinema."" All the colors are there and it's never hard to look at, but it's ultimately as two-dimensional as a trip to the art gallery.",Rotten
It is easy to become immersed in the plight of these characters whose story is profoundly moving and satisfying.,Fresh
"I wouldn't call The Duchess boring; it held my attention. But if you came upon it while channel-surfing, you probably wouldn't stop.",Rotten
Delicious in a costume-drama-y way that will delight fans of the genre while being as entirely lightweight as the enormous ostrich feathers on Georgiana's hats...,Fresh
"It seems Princess Diana was not the only royal whose marriage comprised three people. This cinematic and emotionally potent drama set in the 18th century and based on a true story, looks at a menage a trois that is filled with compelling elements",Fresh
"Mouth watering scandal, a juicy love triangle and high powered men behaving badly make this a solid drama about character and society in 18th century England",Fresh

...fell short by not going into Georgiana's only-alluded-to political life outside her marriage.,Fresh
"Director Saul Dibb pretends that all this stuff is new without actually making it so, and Knightley provides a few requisite Oscar clips with her performance.",Rotten

"Now that he seems past his fey middle period, Ralph Fiennes is doing some amazingly good work onscreen.",Fresh
"The film's real power lies with Knightley. She easily could have gone over the emotional top, but instead gives a measured performance that increasingly draws you in.",Fresh
A handsome costume drama that highlights the relationship between the Cinderella outfits and the restrictive privilege of the society from whence they came.,Fresh
"Knightley seems overly deliberate even in her mischief, and doesn't have Kirsten Dunst's talent for turning acting into a flirtatious game of charades.",Rotten
Keira Knightley is really splendid...,Fresh
The film starts off strong and slowly peters out by the end,Rotten
The Duchess is an intelligent and compelling period drama that offers a critical examination of the lot of women and the abuses of men in a time when such behavior was standard and acceptable.,Fresh
"(U)nless you are a spinster sans a recognizable love life, or someone with little previous knowledge of the genre, everything here will seem rote, baroque, and exceedingly dull.",Rotten
[Knightley's] credible performance is definitely one of the best things about this handsome looking-but-inconsistent biographical drama.,Fresh
"The Duchess is clearly Knightley's movie, ultimately rising or falling on her performance. She's up to the task, capturing both the charm and grace that made Georgiana so captivating.",Fresh
Hums with the rhythms of some of the better Merchant Ivory films.,Fresh
Dibb and his two co-writers are far more concerned with all the tiresome drawing-room melodrama than they are with Georgiana's influence on society.,Rotten
"The film rehabilitates the duchess, sanitizing her behavior",Rotten
You'll spend a lot of time in The Duchess wondering if the film has a point.,Fresh
Though sumptuous and well-acted -- especially by Fiennes -- the picture fails to establish Georgiana as a figure just crying out for a film treatment.,Rotten
It's a beautiful period piece that will send you to a bookstore for a better account of the dirt and vice at its core.,Fresh
"A visually sumptuous, emotionally lacerating melodrama.",Fresh
Within the sphere they've chosen for their story -- really more of a romantic triangle -- it works.,Fresh
"The problem isn't the history that the filmmakers leave in, but how much they leave out.",Rotten
"It's a curiously inert, workmanlike production: a whole lot of pomp and incircumstance.",Rotten
"The Duchess is largely successful because it manages to offer those degrees of humanity and romance (if not blandness) amidst the rest of its potent, bodice-ripping drama.",Fresh
Knightley turns in a performance that impresses us with the strength of her character even as we're appalled by the system that produced it.,Fresh
...a slightly too serious period costume drama,Rotten
The tightly corseted title noblewoman is less interesting than the tightly wound people who bedevil her.,Rotten
...has fine performances and is reasonably true to the facts...,Fresh
"Intelligently written, superbly acted, beautiful to look at and happily free of anachronisms.",Fresh
"Knightley, whose glamorous reputation has outstripped her acting talents until now, is subjected to a barrage of close-ups, which could have been disastrous. Yet it isn't. In this one, she really comes of age.",Fresh
"If you love stories with powdered wigs and scandal, you won't want to miss ""The Duchess.""",Fresh
You'd think a film where the titular character gets drunk at a party and sets her wig on fire would be more fun.,Rotten
Underwhelming but serviceable well-crafted 18th-century English period piece costume drama with modern feminist flavorings.,Rotten
And here we thought Diana was dead.,Fresh
More absorbing and honest than your typical costume drama. Fiennes's performance of the painfully antisocial Duke is impeccable.,Fresh
"Dibb conceived of the right, poignant atmosphere for a glimpse at rarefied 18th-century life but barely read the Cliff's Notes for whose life he was staging, or why he was doing it.",Rotten
"""In the end it may not be much more than a glorified, period-piece soap opera,...but with riveting performances like these, who cares?""",Fresh
"A film of elegance, wit and some power that's just a bit too compromised by its rather soapy underpinnings.",Fresh
"It's disturbingly shallow, focused so tightly on one woman's feelings of repression and loneliness that it lacks any perspective on their causes.",Rotten
It chronicles the saga of a vibrant and forward-thinking woman hampered by the constraints of a rigid society.,Fresh
It's not bad. It's not great. It's just there.,Rotten
"Husbands and boyfriends, be especially diplomatic when accompanying your dates to The Duchess. This lavish look back at a royal pain and his beleaguered bride is a chick flick with anger issues.",Fresh
"Relatively painless, at least by the standards of awards-season chum...",Rotten
Knightley shines in this tale of grace under pressure.,Fresh
This is a wonderful film.,Fresh
There's something really special about Kiera Knightly in these period pieces.,Fresh
"With striking parallels to the life of her direct descendant, Princess Diana, this stunning film of the tortured love life of Duchess Georgiana Spencer is a triumph for its star, Keira Knightley.",Fresh
Hands Keira Knightley another plum leading role and serves as yet another example of how Ralph Fiennes' brooding brand of acting can be successfully employed for all manner of characters.,Fresh
...plays like a Masterpiece Theater adaptation of an eighteen-century soap opera.,Rotten
"Deserves credit for playing things straight %u2013 complete with its moral quagmire and inherent sadness. The performances of Knightley, Fiennes and Atwell really make it work.",Fresh
"Willing to settle for all-around competency instead of excavating history for deeper insights, leaving audiences with another undemanding genre placeholder. [Blu-ray]",Rotten
Knightley and Cooper don't ever generate much in the way of chemistry.,Rotten
"At its simplest, it's a gorgeous film with beautiful period costumes and intricate set designs. However, something tells me that's not the level director Saul Dibb wanted to achieve greatest on.",Rotten
"Everything you'd expect it to be: a well-acted British period piece with lavish attention to period detail, about discontented characters in a royal family. And that's about it.",Rotten
"a refreshing look at British royalty, and it will curb your want to be part of that era, age and societal level",Fresh
"The Duchess doesn't pretend to be anything other than what it is: a comfortable, low-calorie morsel of historical drama.",Fresh
"The Duchess is one of the best and most opulently entertaining historical dramas I have seen in a long time, and it features splendid performances from Keira Knightley and Ralph Fiennes.",Fresh
"Keira wears a series of gorgeous frocks and runs through her full repertoire of smirks and simpers... But if you can look past the dresses and the sullen lips, then you have to admit that [she] delivers another solid performance.",Fresh
"This is meant to be Ms Knightley's film, and in many ways it is. She is in every frame, looks dazzling throughout, and must act with something behind the eyes because in two of her scenes... I welled up rather seriously.",Fresh
"Ignore the details and focus on the big picture. In a year when everybody's focused on the role of women in politics, the life of the Whig trailblazer Georgiana offers plenty of food for thought.",Fresh
"Knightley shines, taking Georgiana from carefree teen to ignored wife then motherhood in a hugely sensitive and honest portrayal. The outfits are stunning, their scale extraordinary, the attention to detail first class; with fashions changing as she does.",Fresh
"Dibb never overwhelms the emotions with overwrought speeches or gaudy costumes, or boggs them down with unnecessary soap opera histrionics.",Fresh

"Lacking humor, wit and bite, this pointless remake of Cukor's 1939 classic is a huge disappointment, turning a sharp, campy and hilarious comedy into a banal melodrama about female camaraderie.",Rotten
"The original version of The Women, shrill and campy as it can be, is miles ahead of this remake when it comes to issues of class and social maneuvering.",Rotten
"Compared to the deliciously catty 1939 film, this one seems not so much updated as, if not neutered, definitely declawed.",Rotten
English struggles trying to create the kind of feel-good experience that seems to come so naturally to femme helmers like Nancy Meyers and Nora Ephron.,Rotten
The Women clangs with so many false moments that you practically leave the theater with tinnitus.,Rotten
"These women are ready for action, but the fur never flies.",Rotten
"Messy construction, trite themes and an endless parade of verbal chestnuts.",Rotten
The Women is such an arduous patchwork of 'issues' it ends up a Frankenstein's monster of a chick flick.,Rotten
This new version of The Women fails to celebrate its characters as women.,Rotten
"As much as I enjoy current actresses like Ms. Bening and Ms. Ryan even in a lost cause, I cannot recommend the latest reenactment of The Women as anything special.",Rotten
"Thankfully, the last 20 minutes of the movie are not a total waste, but I doubt many will stick around long enough to enjoy them",Rotten
"Even though English completely changed Luce's intent from savage satire to 'celebrating women,' and it's far too long, it has a terrific performance by Mendes and some funny lines.",Fresh
"No clich√©, no matter how it screams and pleads for mercy, makes it out of this baby untapped.",Rotten
"An ensemble this good guarantees some lively moments, but the film's outdated message seems more empowering for men.",Rotten
"Soft-focus but high-gloss, substituting empowerment for devotion. It is entertaining but it has a bitter aftertaste.",Fresh
English goes more for sympathy and episodic comedy than substance. Luce wrote her play as a scathing commentary on a social milieu she hated. The Women tries to have it both ways and becomes more caricatured than dimensional.,Rotten
"If you changed the names and added an Irving, this could be the movie version of 'Cathy,' with women trying on bathing suits and saying 'Ack!'",Rotten

"These women, like the movie they're in, are far from perfect, but spending time in their company isn't an entirely unpleasant experience.",Rotten
"Is it an exaggeration to call The Women the worst movie of the year? Well, yeah, probably. But it may be the most disappointing, given all the effort that went into it.",Rotten
"Transforms George Cukor's witty, bitchy The Women (1939) into a cuddly, weepy big-screen sitcom.",Rotten
"It's hard to say what's sadder, that The Women's intended audience had to wait 14 years for a film like this or that that long wait has been almost for naught.",Rotten
"Ryan and Bening seem lost, desperate to convey emotions that they can't access, and English only gives them stale power-woman stereotypes to play.",Rotten
"English means to resurrect the original play's highly evolved '30s era feminism for a post-feminist audience, but the result feels more like a dusted-off quilting circle with an improved sense of style.",Rotten
The original was a tart dipped in acid; this one's a biscuit sprinkled in Splenda.,Rotten

What in heaven's name has Meg Ryan done to her face?,Rotten
"The movie's one-scene-too-many end sequence not only fudges the project's XX-chromosome exclusivity but, weirdly, offers a message that Henry VIII could endorse.",Rotten

"A big-name cast of actresses gives it a go, but everyone from Meg Ryan as the cheated-on wife to Eva Mendes as the home-wrecking perfume girl struggles with a script that resists being crowbarred into the 21st century.",Rotten
Diane English's abysmal remake of George Cukor's 1939 femme classic will have fans of the original growing claws.,Rotten
"The Women isn't terrible. There's too much talent here for that, even if it's displayed unevenly. But it's something that might be even worse: unnecessary, at least as long as you can rent the original.",Rotten
A costly and bemusing disaster. Dull is too kind a word.,Rotten
Cukor's tone and timing are missing: It's as if English has included all the boutiques but none of the bite.,Rotten
"It is difficult to determine whether this adaptation of the old Clare Boothe Luce play, and the 1939 George Cukor film version of it, is a calculated insult to all women or just a poorly directed effort to understand the fair sex.",Rotten
[English] has reduced one of the wittiest women's comedies ever made to just another ho-hum chick flick.,Rotten

"In a post Ab Fab world, The Women is distinctly Ab Blab - an awful lot of nattering that has little edge.",Rotten
Good performances and stylish direction can't disguise what The Women really is: a throwback to a simpler time when women were simple and everyone was happy about it,Rotten
The picture's 14-year path to fruition should have taken a fifteenth in order to get the kinks in the script worked out.,Rotten
"Nothing more, but nothing less than just hilarious flat-out fun that manages to top 'Sex And The City' in every way imaginable.",Fresh
This remake feels more like a Sex and the City knockoff than a reinvention of Cukor's classic.,Rotten
"(Director Diane) English has completely missed the original movie's most distinctive element: its wicked wit. As a result, she's transformed The Women from a catty blast into a declawed exercise in smug self-entitlement.",Rotten
"Please Hollywood: write truthfully for us, and from the heart. It's what Carrie Bradshaw would do.",Rotten
English seems to confuse empowerment with narcissism.,Rotten
One of the worst movies I've ever seen.,Rotten
"In the end, English just wants to make a nice chick flick with some sassy lines. Genuine nastiness has been eliminated, while not-very-funny banter is retained.",Rotten
"In 1939, it [dialogue] was hip and maybe even scandalous...That type of talk and the behavior of these characters crossed the oldie-moldy line somewhere in the early 1970s.",Rotten
"Though aspects of the 1939 comedy seem silly and shrill now, they were at least consistently entertaining. Where the original was deliciously loopy and melodramatic fun, this one is watered-down, sappy and earnest.",Rotten
How do I hate thee? Let me count the ways...,Rotten
"What was then snappy dialogue from meowing madams acting out a morality play on everything that stinks about haute society now flaccidly flaps, lost in translation from old world to new.",Rotten
A mess.,Rotten
"While the actors do what they can, too many characters come off as concepts, not people.",Rotten
"Even those who never saw Cukor's movie will feel something is missing in English's version. Yes, some of what's missing is humor and snappy dialogue, but that could be forgiven, if only some of the characters were more believable.",Rotten
"You go, girls. Preferably as far away as possible.",Rotten
"English has shown herself to be an adept, perceptive, and at times funny writer, but too little of that is on display here.",Rotten
This is a brave but futile endeavor.,Rotten

"Abandon hope, all ye who enter here: Strange casting and a lousy script make The Women the sort of film that's pure torture to sit through.",Rotten
"Fourteen years in the making, The Women marks a serviceable directorial debut for English.",Fresh
"Of all the freedoms that women have rightly earned, aping the worst of male behaviour needn't rank high among them.",Rotten
Do we really need another climactic hospital sequence with a shrieking mom giving birth? And what would Carrie Bradshaw & Co. have done with this same story?,Rotten
"...when [Diane English] starts making her sisterhood-is-powerful changes, the movie runs into serious trouble.",Rotten
Hopefully that audience won't be fooled by this cast's potential and the clever concept; the final product here is anything but fabulous.,Rotten
"Upon further reflection, maybe the big-screen version of Sex and the City wasn't so bad after all.",Rotten
"In spite of the casting and honorable revamps, it feels more dated than the 1939 original did for its time period.",Rotten
It hurts especially to watch Ms. Bening and Candice Bergen (who plays Mary's mother) lend their wit and dignity to a project that has so little of its own.,Rotten

"'What do you think this is, some kind of 1930s movie?' Mary bellows at her mother at one point. If only it were.",Rotten
"Ryan, barely refining her When Harry Met Sally persona, is a dud.",Rotten
The movie is a work of ambivalence. Is English making fun of these women? Or is she making a pilot for Lifetime? It's hard to tell.,Rotten
This Women doesn't take place in reality or even in a glamorous urban fantasyland. It's strictly TV Land.,Rotten
"This is girl power? I'll not have what she's having, thank you very much, and I'm thinking about amassing a small army of my own to demand as much.",Rotten
"English spent 12 years slaving to get her remake green-lighted, an astounding output of time and energy for a person to spend on a movie they don't understand.",Rotten
"There are so many things wrong with this film, but the last straw is that war dance in the delivery room-totally idiotic.",Rotten

"As female ensemble movies go, The Women is no Sex and the City, but it remains watchable thanks to strong performances from Meg Ryan, Annette Bening and Candice Bergen.",Fresh
A ghastly Sex And The City knock-off guaranteed to make its chick-flick audience storm angrily out in search of the next Rambo movie.,Rotten
"Diane English's version of ""The Women"" barely nudges from its Martha Stewart interiors, exchanging insights for platitudes. It's a cup of lukewarm tea, without even a biscuit on the side.",Rotten

"'The Women' entertained me much more than I expected it would, especially after seeing those dreadful previews.",Fresh
Trite and boring portrait of rich and self-absorbed women.,Rotten

Were so many details used on the production design that none were left over for the story?,Rotten

"A Michael Mann movie is a Michael Mann movie, and fans will not be disappointed.",Fresh
"The underconceived Public Enemies suffers from that lack of drive, though Johnny Depp is so urgent and charismatic as John Dillinger, he provides enough firepower to make the film legit.",Fresh
"Although Public Enemies does not ascend to the heights of Bonnie and Clyde or The Untouchables, it is nevertheless an effective depiction of the final months of the life of one of the United States' most infamous criminals.",Fresh
"Michael Mann's sharp-looking movie is a worthy vehicle for Depp, even if it doesn't break any new ground in the well-worn gangster genre.",Fresh
This account is true as far as it goes. It just doesn't go far enough.,Fresh
"With Public Enemies, he has made an impressive film of great formal skill, one that inescapably has a brooding dark-night-of-the-soul quality about it.",Fresh
"Director Michael Mann has taken the story of John Dillinger, and has made from it a drama full of dread and atmosphere, a 140-minute film that in no way seems long, that's a succession of compelling scenes, with no dead wood.",Fresh
"More interesting than involving, Public Enemies focuses on history at the expense of the characters that lived that history. It's all story without emotional impact.",Fresh
It's like spending an afternoon -- a long one -- at a beautifully lit wax-museum display inspired by earlier gangster movies.,Rotten
Public Enemies is as elegant and muscular a film as one could hope for in a summer of flash and noise. Which is not to say director Michael Mann's gangster saga lacks flash and simmer.,Fresh
"As sophisticated as it is entertaining, Public Enemies isn't the sort of film that's usually associated with the summer. But it has more than enough firepower to be a blockbuster.",Fresh
More enamored with the Dillinger myth than with the actual man.,Rotten
"Michael Mann has terrific visual ideas but, in Public Enemies even more than Miami Vice, he is so fascinated by how everything looks that he doesn't care whether the story or people make sense.",Rotten
"While Public Enemies is a well made, well acted, well written film, it's one without a spark at the center to make it truly special.",Rotten
"With its measured, team-produced screenplay by Mann, Ronan Bennett, and Ann Biderman, Public Enemies makes heavy business of the notion that Hoover ushered in an era of ethically elastic law-enforcement procedures still recognizable today.",Fresh
"Amid the summer season of spectacle and silliness, Public Enemies appears as an oasis of adult entertainment.",Fresh
Depp is playing off a marvelous foil in Marion Cotillard.,Fresh
"It might sound damning to say that the film resembles a bullet-riddled carcass just barely clinging to life, but it's exactly this ephemeral sensation, which Mann sustains for the entire two hours +, that distinguishes Public Enemies.",Fresh
"Mann and co-screenwriters Ronan Bennett and Ann Biderman faithfully adapt the Dillinger portion of Bryan Burrough's absorbing 2004 book by the same name, using the same locations where famous breakouts and shootouts occurred.",Fresh
"Could be a battle of wits and wills. Instead, it's a battle to stay awake.",Rotten
"Director Michael Mann mounts a technically proficient, visually enthralling crime drama anchored by the low-key but captivating performance of Johnny Depp as legendary bank robber John Dillinger.",Fresh
"Public Enemies, despite packing thunderous rounds of ammunition, is a touch too remote.",Rotten
"Great performances, great camera work, but just not engrossing. It did accomplish one thing though. It made me want to go read a book on Dillinger so I can be moved in the way I should have been by the film.",Fresh
"True-crime story or romantic myth-making? This was the question I brought in to Michael Mann's Public Enemies...and, though seemingly an either-or proposition, the question still on my mind when I walked out.",Fresh
The movie ends with a line of dialogue so startlingly inane that it leaves the picture flapping on the screen like a punctured balloon. It may be the most brutal moment in the whole movie.,Rotten
It simply doesn't posses the same sort of testosterone-fueled intensity and bravado that made the filmmaker's earlier effort something of a classic in the action genre.,Rotten
"For all its surface beauty and energetic shootouts, this underwritten picture doesn't cut very deep and is strangely inert.",Rotten
We've been left with a film that can't settle on which history it wants to tell and ends up dispelling the myth that a new film by Michael Mann is a cause worth celebrating.,Rotten
"An action-heavy thriller so consistently barebones and lacking in any truly subversive thrust, and with mere peripheral vision of the historical moment, that the guns and clothes have more personality than the people.",Rotten
"What could have been Michael Mann's masterpiece ends up being a bland, slow, emotionless film with a couple of brilliant scenes sprinkled in the mix.",Rotten
"You desperately want to be grabbed and taken along for what should be one of the most exciting ""true stories"" in history, but instead you're stuck wondering why actors as good as Depp and Bale aren't able to make their characters come to life and a direct",Rotten
"Even when Dillinger is at rest, Public Enemies exudes a nervous tension, the sense that flight is imminent.",Fresh
Ultimately an odd blend of frustrating and satisfying.,Rotten
"This is the purest of American narratives, and this, indeed, is one of our finest storytellers.",Fresh
Audience members who find themselves on the same wavelength as Mann and his screenwriters will find enough to talk about to keep them raving about Public Enemies for days.,Fresh
"If there is one thing that Mann makes sure to get right in his movies, it's the look, and Public Enemies is no exception.",Fresh
"In the hands of Michael Mann the film looks great, feels deliberate, and effectively explores our culture's fascination with outlaws.",Fresh
"Public Enemies is a good film but considering the talent working on it, it is not unfair to say that it really should have been a better film.",Fresh
"As always, no one does a bank heist quite like Mann, but as one of the most under-rated director's from the West, very few can tell a story as rich and complete as him either.",Fresh
This is swooning male anti-hero worship.,Fresh
America's love affair with gangsters and gangster movies started when such writers as 1920s Chicago crime reporter Ben Hecht and novelist W.R. Burnett went West to forge the myth of a new American criminal in the smithy of Hollywood's Dream Machine.,Fresh

"It's flat and direct, and when a line or two slips out that sounds like it wants to elevate Dillinger's life into a grand theme, it's quickly hammered down.",Rotten
Public Enemies is a delicious feast for an interpretive viewer.,Fresh
Our connections with Public Enemies remain abstract. The darkness and the distance kill the fun.,Rotten
"Public Enemies is, at its core, a fascinating portrait of criminal narcissism.",Fresh
"Public Enemies is a riveting, carefully paced character-driven piece that's a fascinating trip into American history.",Fresh
Too detached emotionally and a bit opaque in its characterizations but the swift footed camera work has a harsh beauty and Johnny Depp entertains.,Fresh

This period gangster saga may be filled with exciting gun battles yet can't deliver the firepower in ways that matter the most.,Rotten
The story of the visually curious Michael Mann film Public Enemies has been told before in movies more exciting but rarely more thoughtful than this one.,Fresh
The cat and mouse game played by the world's most prolific bank robber and the first big-time FBI agent isn't worth a slice of government cheese.,Rotten
"... as strange and exhilarating as riding the running board of John Dillinger's fast, shiny, black getaway car.",Fresh
"The best rejoinder to Public Enemies is Michael Jackson's Smooth Criminal video... It's a tommy-gun gangster fantasia with a touch of Guys and Dolls, and it's everything Public Enemies isn't.",Rotten
"Johnny Depp plays John Dillinger with wry charm, but the famous actor also gets in the legendary gangster's way.",Rotten
"Mann excels at staging the chaotic bank jobs and bloody shootouts that were just a day at the office for Dillinger, but even at 140 minutes the movie is so dense with incident that there isn't much room for cultural comment or character development.",Rotten
Uses the gangster movie form to say something profound and unexpected about the way we respond to evil.,Fresh
"Public Enemies is exactly what summer audiences deserve - a smart, sophisticated action movie. So why does it feel like a letdown?",Fresh
"After all the gunfire exchanges, there's not much time for the human exchange. Neither for the leads or the colorful secondary characters. Such glorious acting talent, gone up in so much machine gun smoke.",Fresh
"This is a hugely enjoyable, impressively directed thriller with a great ensemble cast and powerful performances by Johnny Depp, Christian Bale and Marion Cotillard.",Fresh
"Rather than deconstruct our culture's romanticized vision of Dillinger as a handsome populist hero, Mann adds to the gangster's puffed-up Robin Hood image. A missed opportunity.",Fresh
"Boasts solid performances by Johnny Depp and the radiant Marion Cotillard, but suffers from excessive style over substance. It often drags and lacks insight, palpable thrills along with dramatic tension.",Rotten
There are powerful images that sear into your brain upon contact with your eyes but PUBLIC ENEMIES clearly wants to alienate the audience as much as it engages them.,Fresh
"Never mind crime, I'm declaring the nation's first war on hand-held cameras.",Rotten
Michael Mann's Public Enemies is epic filmmaking with B-movie content. It's as if a wannabe David Lean got down and dirty Americana-style.,Fresh
"Though less ravishing than Miami Vice, Public Enemies again finds Michael Mann forging new ground in the digital arts.",Fresh
If John Dillinger had not existed... Michael Mann would have had to invent him.,Fresh
"It's a fascinating moment in history, and Mann captures the cars, the guns and the buildings with painstaking, immersive authenticity.",Fresh
Even the bank jobs and prison breaks feel perfunctory and enervated.,Rotten
Mann's best film since Heat is arguably the best movie anyone's made since Heat.,Fresh
Questionable production values alone are not enough to sink a movie. Cinema doesn't have to look great if it has something to say. But it's not entirely clear what Public Enemies is trying to say.,Rotten
"It's a picture with virility and confidence, and unlike Dillinger's machine-gun, which the man himself expertly takes to pieces, it never quite jams, and gets off one or two lethal rounds.",Fresh
"What's dismaying about Public Enemies, over and beyond the unintelligibility of much of the dialogue and the sliminess of its digital sheen, is that it has no sense of why it's been made.",Rotten
"Many talented people, but especially Christian Bale are short-changed by his clouded vision. The brightly glaring digital photography doesn't help, but in the end the worst crime is that the story is just plain dull.",Rotten

A film more to admire than to love.,Fresh
"Classy for sure. Sharply paced too. But while Public Enemies gives Bonnie And Clyde a run for their money, The Godfather has nothing to fear.",Fresh
"This superstar crime thriller emerges as something surprising, fascinating and technically dazzling. Don't expect a Hollywood movie. Expect a Michael Mann movie.",Fresh
"This crisp digital look affords Public Enemies an incredible sense of immediacy. Mann, too, has a strong eye for forensic detail that ramps up the vividness of the film.",Fresh
"Whilst there is a lot of gun action and violent set pieces in this, it's really a piece that is really all about the characters and it hands down the best gangster movie of the last decade... at least. One of this year's few must see movies.",Fresh
"Mann dedicates himself to making Dillinger look cool, and that's the problem with the whole movie. It looks the business, but has no depth, nothing to say, no new angle. It just feels like a homage to older, better films.",Rotten
What Michael Mann has achieved with the new Public Enemies is to capture some of the raw energy and allure of the old gangster B-films.,Fresh
"It tills the old ground, albeit with new-style star power and Mann's signature cinematic flourishes. But Depp is unduly subdued and Mann's cape work is oversold.",Fresh
It lacks the cinematic gravitas to stand alongside classic gangster epics like 'Bonnie and Clyde' and 'The Untouchables.',Rotten
"Here is a film alive in a way we've not perceived before: a breathtakingly new visual experience, a precision-choreographed action thriller, and a classically minded piece of American art.",Fresh
"Shot in pin-sharp high-definition, this is one amazing-looking movie, where even the most ordinary scenes crackle with energy and suspense. As with Heat, Mann's made not just the crime drama of the year, but possibly of the decade too.",Fresh
"Like Dillinger, the film lives fast, only to die young.",Fresh
Public Enemies is one of those films that lurches between sheer brilliance and muddled moments... but it does feature Johnny Depp in terrific form and is worth seeing just for him alone.,Fresh
"While the FBI's brave new ideas worked, Mann's do not.",Fresh
"Public Enemies is original because everyone, outlaw and enforcer, criminal and cop, looks and behaves the same.",Fresh
"Confusions of mood are exacerbated by some fussy camera-work - handheld jigging, switches between sepia and grainy, modern video. What it needs is the old-fashioned simplicities: a bit more black-and-white; a bit more bang bang.",Fresh
"Public Enemies is an efficient, well-made period thriller the impact of which is dulled by our familiarity with the subject and knowledge of the outcome.",Fresh
"Those anticipating crackling, Heat-style cat-and-mouse Al Pacino/Robert de Niro face-offs will be left like disappointed kittens without the cream.",Rotten
Michael Mann may not succeed with Public Enemies but the attempt is compelling enough.,Fresh
"An on-the-spot, VIP ushering into the gangster movie hall of fame. It's a real movie, one which you'll be proud to say you paid to see. Eat that, Optimus.",Fresh
"Mann approaches this film almost like poetry, using fine camerawork and editing to focus on internal emotions",Fresh
"The highlights are too few, and come far too late in the hefty 140-minute running time. This film is an attempt at great art that fails.",Rotten
With great period detail it's purely an A to B account of Dillinger's last days. Perhaps I was expecting more from the talent involved in making what is still a solid enough summer blockbuster.,Fresh
Mann never quite transforms any of it into something cohesive. It's if he has decided to present us with lots of stunning raw material and expects us to do all the work in making it make sense. It's a bold approach.,Fresh

"Another intriguing performance by Johnny Depp is the highlight of 'Public Enemies,' a film not always easy to follow.",Fresh
"Expect good but not great. Despite the clear talent behind this highly competent film, it is a little disappointing Public Enemies is not as Best Picture quality as it purports to be.",Fresh
It was tough to get caught in those days. These FBI guys couldn't catch an STD from Brett Michaels.,Fresh
"The narrative has a few holes, but on the whole this will please fans of the genre and those looking for an accessible document of John Dillinger's life.",Fresh
Public Enemies traffics in the accumulation of detail at the expense of a big picture.,Rotten
"A decent look at Dillinger, then, but by no means the masterpiece it could have been.",Fresh
"In a film that somewhat disapoints, casting is top rate.",Fresh
"I do think this is a film worth seeing, so obviously, I say see it.",Fresh
"Some strong performances, but I expected more from this great director and stellar cast.",Rotten
"Public Enemies isn't my No. 1 of the year, but it's close. Even more powerful than Depp is the way Mann controls this film's look and feel.",Fresh
...Johnny Depp and Christian Bale playing cops and robbers in fedoras and pinstripe suits.,Fresh
The great theme of 'Public Enemies' is the inevitability and finality of death.,Fresh
Johnny Depp does his best but the script gives him no possible way to present a fully fleshed out character,Rotten
"Some sloppy storytelling prevents Public Enemies from reaching greatness anyway, but what hampers the movie is Mann's decision to shoot in high definition video. The movie just looks cheap.",Fresh

Public Enemies wears it well.,Fresh
"Though faithful to Bryan Burrough's painstakingly researched book, Michael Mann's 'Public Enemies' offers more an abstract impression of Dillinger than a fully satisfying portrait.",Fresh
The film ends powerfully.,Fresh
It's an adult drama that tells a great historic story... a story about eras changing... a very strong dramatic movie on a very big scale.,Fresh
"Mann draws a sprawling cast together with a myriad of period details that give an authentic sheen, without letting the audience get confused in the sea of historic information.",Fresh
"Sensational and turbulent, the relationship between John Dillinger and Melvin Purvis sold newspapers and attracted newsreel audiences. It was good for business.",Fresh
In this era where we all hate banks (as Mojo Nixon once sang) does Hollywood really want to put out a film that glorifies bank robbers? Obviously yes.,Rotten

"... Depp has a few solid scenes that spark to life, only to have the spark fail to ignite a consistent interest in the story.",Rotten
"John Dillinger was a violent man who died a violent death.In 'Public Enemies,' we learn the story of how he evaded the FBI %u2013 even escaping from prison - to become a nationally known bank robber and Public Enemy No. 1.",Fresh
"You would think that sexy 1930's gangsters using excessive force and chasing around in gorgeous cars would at least be enough to help me forget that I need to do some laundry, but you would be wrong.",Rotten

"At times incoherent, at times self conscious and thanks to Dante Spinotti being allowed to go hand held, almost always irritating to watch.",Rotten
"Mann's film is an explosive affair, filled with pounding bullets, graphic violence and a heart-warming love story at its core that changes the way we view the cult outlaw who lives only for today",Fresh

I actually found a complete lack of character development here.,Fresh
"There's a lot to admire, but it's not up to the standard of Mann's, or Depp's, best work.",Fresh
Director Michael Mann's return to crime is a breathtaking gangster movie shot in unusual though spectacular digital high definition.,Fresh
"Over 140 minutes that genuinely fly by, Mann crafts a highly atmospheric and emotion-charged movie experience that is sure to be remembered as a touchstone release of 2009.",Fresh
"Best of all, Mann and his cast achieve a grim atmosphere of fatal inevitability as the net slowly tightens around Dillinger and his free-wheeling criminal cohorts.",Fresh
"Certainly worth a look, but you might feel that Mann keeps his characters, apart from Billie, at arm's length.",Fresh
"Depp and Bale as Dillinger and the FBI agent tracking him are excellent and the film is a consistently entertaining, thoughtful and high paced ride, that Dillinger actually did the more extraordinary actions portrayed is the only way their inclusion in a",Fresh
The choice of digital tends to only exacerbate the films many flaws. It even reveals the imperfections of Johnny Depp's face. Who wants to see that?,Rotten
"Like Dillinger, Mann and his jangly camera live for the moment. If Public Enemies doesn't cut it as history or mythologising, it succeeds staggeringly well as a series of set pieces.",Fresh
I'd say this is Mann's best film since The Insiders. Or maybe even The Last of the Mohicans. Now there's glory.,Fresh
Public Enemies finds [Mann] a bit slower on his feet. The film lacks the narrative dexterity of Collateral and The Insider. And the end result veers between solid and stolid.,Fresh
"A triumph of pure cinema, Public Enemies is one of the most visually experimental films of Mann's career.",Fresh
"Mann and his writers recount Dillinger's story clearly and with more historical accuracy than some of the earlier film versions, but you're left wondering, ""So what?""",Rotten
Michael Mann is our poet laureate of bank robbery.,Fresh
"By the time director Michael Mann gets around to making clear his intention of creating a throwback to Hollywood gangster films of the '30s, ""Public Enemies"" has long since worn out its welcome.",Rotten
"...a thinking man's gangster movie. While there's plenty of action for those looking for a shoot-'em-up, it's a decidedly cold-blooded affair",Fresh
"You can put together all the elements that should create gold and yet without that charmed, mysterious sprinkle of cinematic pixie dust, the alchemy fails to work.",Rotten
The popular reaction to what the defiant anti-hero came to represent in depression-era America made it almost criminal to call him one.,Fresh
An experimental film masked as a studio blockbuster,Fresh
"Michael Mann, director of Public Enemies has capped an extremely impressive decade of work with a movie that approaches greatness but just misses.",Fresh
Not to say this is not a well-crafted movie with excellent performances. It is. It is also curiously one-sided and shallow like many movies about famous outlaws tend to be.,Fresh
"Depp's performance overcomes every flaw in the film. He ends up playing Dillinger exactly as he should be--suave, mysterious, romantic, but with obvious elements of cruelty and unbridled violence.",Rotten
Feels like experimental filmmaking and never seems to transcend that to something more profound or awe-inspiring.,Rotten
A lesson in how watching a man in front of the camera hit his mark can make one wish the man behind the camera had such true aim.,Fresh
Public Enemies is an enjoyable experience but it feels like it could have been a whole lot more and another gangster classic.,Fresh
"Public Enemies is a thoroughly detailed and engaging crime epic, which traces the criminal exploits and pursuit of infamous gangster, John Dillinger.",Fresh
"Mann seems undecided about what he wants Enemies to accomplish, so he tries a little bit of everything.",Rotten

"Adheres to the historical facts of Dillinger's well-documented tapestry of brazen daylight heists, gritty shootouts and improbable jailbreaks.",Fresh
"Instead of glamorizing the early 20th century thug life, it humanizes it a little too much. This drags the movie down and is not the reason I like to go see gangster movies.",Rotten
It's looking more and more like Michael Mann will never be able to recapture that Heat hotness.,Fresh
"On a sweltering July day in 1934, John Dillinger went to the movies and ended up dead. Now, 75 years later, the movies are killing him again.",Rotten
"A quiet, thoughful, almost dreamy meditation on violence, on work, on love and on death. It's The Insider with tommy guns.",Fresh
The desperate times in which we suddenly find ourselves ... make Public Enemies seem especially timely.,Fresh
The reflection of pink neon off the crimson silk of a lawman's tie as he stands in wait under the Biograph marquee; a patch of sodium-vapor orange city sky above a bridge as magnetic and floating as a square in a Rothko canvas...,Fresh
"Only Depp prevents the film sinking beneath its own weight. His performance is so stunning, the rest of the big-name cast is almost wasted as he absorbs the audience's full attention.",Fresh
"... it was entertaining, but quite long.",Fresh
"Yes, this is a gangster movie worth seeing, and it should be seen on the big screen.",Fresh
"There is much to admire in this film... But it's as if the whole thing has been emotionally cauterised. It holds you at arm's length. As such, I found it peculiarly unsatisfying. If it had been a restaurant meal, I'd have come home and had a sandwich.",Rotten
"Public Enemies is an oddly soft, slow, elegiac film, which isn't necessarily a bad thing. Some of my best friends are elegiac films. But it seems a regrettable approach to its main subject.",Rotten
There is no tension or suspense in the chase.,Rotten
A seasoned genre filmmaker at the height of his game; still able to turn even one of his lesser works into something classy and gripping.,Fresh
"Mann has shown an ability to create an interesting crime drama. He doesn't fail here, capturing the era to perfection, but there is an almost distant feel to the material that makes the film more cold and calculated than one might expect.",Fresh
"The lush sets and gorgeous costumes coupled with the grainy cinematography make for a totally immersive experience, pulling a modern audience into a bygone era of fast cars, tommy guns and femme fatales.",Fresh
"[A] beautifully crafted action movie that has brains, brawn and beauty in equal measure. Simply, stunning.",Fresh
"Somehow this bigger-than-life, true cat-and-mouse saga never fully hits the heights of its ambitions or the capabilities of its cast.",Rotten
It is easily one of 2009's most satisfying action dramas for adults.,Fresh

"Finally, he arrives at a masterfully deployed bit of third-act rug-pulling so unexpected that it may be Hong's way of saying we are all stumbling toward an uncertain horizon.",Fresh

"The directness of Sun-nam's voiceover encapsulates what's salient about Hong's approach, which lays everything bare and leaves little room for ambiguity.",Fresh
"Hong works in long, improvised scenes that seem to go nowhere, but they're so rife with sexual subtext that, even at 144 minutes, the movie never feels long.",Fresh
A startling misfire.,Rotten
"The film has the focused derangement of a suicide bomber...but I for one am elated to see such brazenness, such mystery, and such crazy, highwire ambition back in the movie theater.",Fresh
It's largely Tilda Swinton's presence that saves Julia from itself.,Fresh
"It is no easier to warm to Zonca's film than to its central character - but it is impossible to take your eyes off either. Amoral, at times brutal, and full of surprises...",Fresh
It's the slow burn of Swinton's idiosyncratic but engrossing interpretation of this unlikely heroine that holds the movie together and provides an end result that is both affecting and teasingly different.,Fresh
"Tilda Swinton gives a committed and courageously unsympathetic performance as the self-serving Julia, but this is a character with whom you would rather spend as little time as possible - and certainly not the endurance-testing running time.",Rotten
"Zonca has put together an ambitious and forthright story, but Swinton's contribution looks more like an actressy impersonation than a performance, and indeed Zonca's film itself looks like a European facsimile of Americana.",Rotten
"Weighing in at 140 minutes, it's a long, often difficult watch, but made compelling by Swinton's tour-de-force and some solid support, particularly Saul Rubinek as her sympathetic ex-boyfriend.",Fresh
"If the script had been half as powerful as Swinton, this could have been special.",Rotten
"Unfortunately the Cassevetes-style film needed Cassavetes to make it. Zonca, essaying a pell-mell verismo, produces something resembling Gloria mugged by A Woman Under the Influence.",Rotten
Swinton's Julia is one of those performances that goes so far in repelling audience sympathy that it comes out the other side looking almost admirable.,Rotten
Plot twists and supporting characters all play second fiddle to her portrayal of a woman who's as fascinating as she is morally bankrupt.,Fresh
"Julia, by and large, is a tale of desperate opportunists, fugitive souls who survive by living on their wits, taking risks and making it up as they go along. It sometimes feels that a similar person is behind the camera as well as in front of it.",Fresh
"Gripping, tense and often wildly unpredictable thriller, superbly directed by Erick Zonca and featuring a ferocious central performance from Tilda Swinton.",Fresh
"Julia is at once a marvel of screen acting, an unthinkably black comedy, and one of the few truly nail-biting suspense films to emerge this decade.",Fresh
"""Julia"" is more than an homage to John Cassavetes' 1980 maternal crime thriller ""Gloria;"" it is a spectacularly flawed genre experiment that goes so wrong, and with such an intense fury, that you can't pull yourself away from it.",Rotten
"After a 10-year absence, French filmmaker Erick Zonca is back with a flawed but gripping English-language thriller powered by a superlative Tilda Swinton.",Fresh
Swinton's character may be unsympathetic but the actress imbues her with a humanity that is engaging.,Fresh
"Swinton masterfully pours much more than her heart into her drunken damsel in distress performance in this gin drenched drama. But the audience is unfortunately left to languish without a clue, as to how she ended up that way and who she may be when sober",Rotten
"Zonca's story is an unruly beast, lurching this way and that like a biker hopped up on mescaline and paint thinner, its unpredictable rowdiness in sync with its out-of-control protagonist.",Fresh
"A nightmare of alcoholic bad behavior grafted to a chilling thriller ... you have no idea, scene to scene, where Zonca's desperately unstable tale will take you.",Fresh
"Jeered upon its premiere at the 2008 Berlin Film Festival and only now receiving a token U.S. release, Julia demands to be reassessed and reckoned with.",Fresh
"This overlong, lurchy homage to John Cassavetes' 1980 film Gloria is a mess, but a fascinating one, given Swinton's desperately avid performance in the title role.",Fresh
Thrillingly far off the rails.,Fresh
Rages so strongly and effectively against alcoholism that it might convert some in the audience to Mormonism.,Fresh
Will be remembered for the unforgettable performance by Swinton that drives this inventive thriller.,Fresh
"[Director] Zonca's merely feeding off Swinton's manic performance, which starts out tough to watch, then becomes gripping.",Fresh
[Tilda Swinton] is on screen for nearly every second of this two-and-a-quarter-hour-+ film and it's a startling star turn indeed.,Fresh
"We never get a good look at her demons, just the havoc they wreak.",Rotten
"Picture Fargo played with no sense of comedy, and you'll get some idea of the absurdity of this drunken floozy, clicking and wobbling on high heels, often with bits of her anatomy hanging out, trying to pull off the perfect crime.",Rotten
"Like any beautiful, heartbreaking wreck -- we can never take our eyes off Julia. Or the fierce and uncompromising actress bringing her to awful, astonishing life.",Fresh
A bungled thriller that starts out badly and never recovers.,Rotten
"Ms. Swinton doesn't have Ms. Rowlands' tenderness, but, damn, she has just about everything else you need or want.",Fresh
"Boasts an electrifying, brave performance by Tilda Swinton and has a thrilling initial half, but eventually becomes tedious and convoluted while lacking plausibility and insight into the titular character.",Rotten
"Zonca's Julia is a difficult movie to stomach, but entirely worth the emotional unrest it puts through you.",Fresh
"This is Zonca's second feature. His first, The Dreamlife of Angels, was extraordinary. Rent that one instead.",Rotten
"Julia is a mix of fantasy and tragedy, with the violence amped up and the background noisy and lurid.",Fresh
"This is not really sure what it wants to be, an out-an-out thriller or a character portrait, but it exels at both in parts.",Fresh
"a tonally-consistent, lively thriller that is very much of the filmmaker's own little corner of the world",Fresh
Swinton is mesmerising as a messed-up drunk.,Fresh
A nerve-wracking thriller with a twisty plot and startling realism.,Fresh
"In a sense, it goes to all the places a sensitive character study might have gone, but more dramatically, convincingly and vividly.",Fresh
"I recommend going to see it, but don't blame me when you feel like you've downed a fifth of vodka afterwards.",Fresh
"I salute the film's bravery for rushing off at full force on its own stream-of-consciousness logic, but for me, I found the final stages perhaps a tad too far-fetched.",Fresh
"The plot is over-the-top, but Swinton makes you stay with the film long after the writer/director loses credibility.",Fresh
"Charles Bukowski would have loved this foul-mouthed, fiery, reckless woman. Against all odds and common sense, you will, too.",Fresh
"Tilda Swinton is electrifying in this riveting, knock-your-socks-off crime thriller that is just about as intense as movies get.",Fresh
"If you're feeling adventurous, seek it out. Swinton's masterful performance as the flailing, desperate L.A. alcoholic Julia will more than reward your time.",Fresh
"In Erick Zonca's tense and juicy noir, Tilda Swinton plays the title role with a crusty panache matched only by her matted, flaming-red thatch of hair (a character in its own right).",Fresh
One should hope Tilda Swinton has a good dental plan - it will come in handy when the time comes to pry out the scenery she aggressively chomps.,Rotten
"It's simply impossible to imagine Eric Zonca's Julia, a noirish thriller and sharp character study inspired by Cassavetes' Gloria, without Tilda Swinton, who dominates the film from start to finish.",Fresh
Tilda Swinton's strong central performance saves an otherwise routine drug drama.,Fresh
"Swinton approaches Julia with an all-or-nothing attitude, creating an ungodly eccentric character and evoking an impressive array of audience emotions.",Fresh
"Complications pile up, confrontations are manufactured, and numerous Mexican baddies materialize as the runtime needlessly heads past the two-hour mark.",Rotten
"Risky, genuine, and alive.",Fresh
"Starring Tilda Swinton in the title role, Zonka's film is essentially a pointless exercise in extreme behavior.",Rotten
Genteel Western.,Rotten
"This black-and-white Western, which is Wayne's debut as producer, signals several elements of what would become the John Wayne iconic screen image, partly due to writer James Grant who was a frequent collaborator.",Fresh
One of Wayne's top B efforts; an offbeat love story that works as a romance as well as a Western. Russell is luminous.,Fresh
"With its stunning Flagstaff, Arizona locations and a breezy tone, the John Wayne-produced ""Angel and the Badman"" is a delightful mix of romance and action, with excellent chemistry between the leads.",Fresh
"All credit to writer-director Oliver Parker for trying to broaden his CV, but Danny Huston is a terrible bore as Welles, Paz Vega continues to be incomprehensible in English, and the murky mystery plot limps along unrewardingly.",Rotten
"On paper this must have looked a neat idea: a wildly fictionalised account of a skid-row Orson Welles, up to his neck in political skulduggery while shooting a third-rate picture in post-war Italy.",Rotten
"A retro pastiche that, like The Good German before it, will be of limited interest to all but the most ardent film buff.",Rotten
"Like Black Magic itself, alas, this is destined to be a forgotten curio of limited appeal.",Rotten
"For all its flaws, it's a movie-lover's movie, and clear evidence that Parker should push himself a bit more often.",Fresh
"Fade to Black is as sleek and attractive as the chrome polished vintage cars Huston travels in, but never truly gets in gear.",Fresh
A terrific idea is unfortunately wasted. The great cast is wasted too.,Rotten
"Angel Heart is a thriller and a horror movie, but most of all it's an exuberant exercise in style, in which Parker and his actors have fun taking it to the limit.",Fresh

One of the few truly great modern horror films,Fresh

Seriously creepy bayou noir with more twists than you can shake a chicken bone at.,Fresh
A hot little movie with even hotter performances,Fresh
"Metaphysical and emotional anemia is an important tradition in cult horror/mystery, a category the daffy plot twists and crimson, incestuous excesses of Angel Heart sit quite cozily in.",Rotten
Offbeat Faustian voodoo tale about the descent of a sleazy private detective into hell.,Fresh
"The book's so good it deserves a better movie, but Rourke's performance is such that Angel Heart stands out from the necromancy movie crowd.",Fresh
[This genre] is especially satisfying for me because it mixes menace from two sources. There is no femme more fatale than Mr. Scratch. There is no noir darker than the promise of the pits of hell.,Fresh
A sexy and loopy nightmare drenched in blood.,Fresh
'The banality of evil' is a phrase one hears. It doesn't mean that you can represent evil with cliches.,Rotten
Angel Heart has more style than substance. But what style!,Fresh
"Parker's text is impossibly rich, impossibly complex.",Fresh

It is an irredeemable affair.,Rotten
"...a morass of cliche, crotch shots and utter disregard for both logic and the audience. Walt Disney and poor Bernie Mac must be turning over in their graves.",Rotten
A flawed but likable piece of fluff with zany antics and earnest sentiment to spare. Its infectious energy and naively big heart gradually win you over.,Fresh
"A spastic, noxious comedy, Old Dogs is scattershot and out of control, bludgeoning the audience with all sorts of eye-bulging mugging and dire clich. It's insufferable and lazily directed.",Rotten
"If Old Dogs isn't the absolute worst movie either star has appeared in, it's close enough to count.",Rotten
"Largely forgetting the kids as it subjects its stars to one humiliation after another, Old Dogs doesn't even have the courage to commit to its familiar but serviceable premise.",Rotten
A cheesy chew-toy of a comedy about reluctant fatherhood.,Rotten
"Predictable as the premise is, Travolta's and Williams' unpredictability makes for some chortle-worthy slapstick, less of Laurel & Hardy vintage than of Abbott & Costello swill.",Fresh
"Williams is encouraged to supercharge his silliness, Travolta plays straight man and the kids are relegated to background noise.",Rotten
There are some experiences no one should be subjected to even in the name of science. It may be that forced viewing of this film has been outlawed by the Geneva Convention.,Rotten
"Insipid, predictable, broad comedy mixed with Disney Family Values makes for one exasperating sit.",Rotten
"The movie includes an interminable scene of the men taking the wrong medications for their various boomer ailments, with weirdly horrible comedic side effects.",Rotten
"There are no new tricks in Old Dogs, a broad and frenetic family comedy which puts John Travolta and Robin Williams together with two cute kids in a cozily predictable family-comes-first scenario.",Rotten
"In the first scene, we find out that Williams-Bot does not feel comfortable around children, because he kicks a soccer ball at a child and breaks the child's nose! This is very funny.",Rotten
Does no one know how to film physical comedy anymore?,Rotten
Too bad this shrilly tuned comedy doesn't demand more than clock-punching effort from everyone involved.,Rotten

A great opportunity to gather family members you clearly think are stupid.,Rotten
"If Old Dogs were a person, I would stab it in the face.",Rotten

"This excruciating comedy tests the limits of how many shots to the crotch a movie can show, or an audience can absorb.",Rotten
Incredibly dull and generic.,Rotten
Clueless-dad comedy is forgettable family fluff.,Rotten
An often riotously funny slapstick farce that ought to appeal to moviegoers of all ages.,Fresh
"A slack, sagging 88 minutes still feels rushed, with what must have been scenes trimmed down to micro-blip montages, and a final scene playing out over the credits; it feels like even the people making Old Dogs wanted to be done with it.",Rotten
"Exactly as funny as you'd expect a movie to be that stars John Travolta and Robin Williams as two bachelors who must suddenly take care of precocious 7-year-old twins, and that was directed by the man who made Wild Hogs.",Rotten
"We have reached a point in our moviegoing life where the two most horrifying words a studio can mutter are ""Robin"" and ""Williams.""",Rotten
"Old Dogs doesn't just roll over and play dead, it is in fact lifeless.",Rotten
Old Dogs does to the screen what old dogs do to the carpet. It's unfortunate that only the latter can be taken out and shot.,Rotten
The great thing about comedy these days is that few people are making movies like Old Dogs.,Rotten
"Unfunny and uninspired, this dog deserves to be put down.",Rotten
"Kids who suffer from progeria may be able to relate to Old Dogs, but it's hard to imagine anyone else fully appreciating it.",Rotten
Director Walt Becker can't even pull off hits to the groin (you know they're coming in a movie like this) with as much panache as an episode of America's Funniest Home Videos.,Rotten
"The ploy of pairing John Travolta and Robin Williams, whose salaries probably represented most of the budget, is the only pedigree Old Dogs has going for it.",Rotten
"As if to compensate, ""Old Dogs"" continually cuts away from Williams' antics to ""cute"" reaction shots from an actual old dog. That's a really bad sign for a movie.",Rotten
"The timing of the comic set-ups is consistently amateurish, as if scenes were edited with hedge clippers, with the actors mugging frantically, waiting for the take to end.",Rotten
"Only the irrepressible Luis Guzmn, stuck in a walk-on bit as the stereotypical mooching Hispanic, is able to milk this cash cow and exit with his dignity intact.",Rotten
Painful.,Rotten
A total train wreck.,Rotten
"Old Dogs is no fun whatsoever, just a collection of stale kibble.",Rotten
"Director Becker treats the comedy in Old Dogs the same as if he were treating a case of mange: Apply two gags, rub in liberally, and call in the morning with the box-office totals. Aarf.",Rotten
Old Dogs seems to have lingered in post-production while editors struggled desperately to inject laugh cues. It obviously knows no one will find it funny without being ordered to.,Rotten
"A painfully unfunny attempt at comedy filled with lazy, juvenile, forced humor that's an insult to everyone's intelligence.",Rotten
"a strong cast fighting a script that is labored, stale, and obvious",Rotten
Might be best just to let these sleeping Old Dogs lie. This incredibly loony comedy sort of demeans everyone involved.,Rotten
"Like rancid leftovers, this bland, contrived comedy is a toxic turkey, a buddy/family film gone wrong.",Rotten
Old Dogs is beyond saving. The only humane thing to do is to put it down.,Rotten
"Based on the quality of its script, 'Old Dogs' should have been put to sleep before the cameras started rolling.",Rotten
"Let's hope that kills any chance for another film of this ilk, probably called Cool Frogs or something horrid like that.",Rotten
"Travolta and Williams have been around long enough to know that when doing comedy, sometimes 'less is more.'",Rotten
Here's a Thanksgiving turkey that was rancid as soon as the idea was cooked up.,Rotten
"Really, what it affirms is that studio executives are already making movies for the future-audience from Idiocracy.",Rotten
"With John Travolta and Robin Williams mugging as best buds who care for two 7-year-olds, this stinky mutt of a movie pees on your leg and tells you it's comedy.",Rotten
"""Old Dogs"" also wants to entertain the adults in the audience. Frankly, any adult who finds this film humorous may be at the same level of intelligence as their child and someone should call child services immediately.",Rotten
"It's kind of a funny story. Actually it isn't. And not much in this movie is, unless you like to watch elderly dogs urinate, middle-aged movie stars overact wildly, and Seth Green get hit in the groin by a golf ball.",Rotten
"Why do once great actors attach themselves to a dog of a picture like this? Surely they still have standards? Alas, their judgment seems to be fading . . .",Rotten
The dearth of laughs in this unspeakably awful comedy borders on embarrassing at times.,Rotten
"Nobody taught these ""Old Dogs"" any new tricks for this seen it all before film",Rotten
"Add scary music, and some scenes could come straight from a horror movie, with no need for re-editing, as when Williams is trapped in a tanning booth, or when Williams slams a car trunk's lid onto a woman's arms, like Terry O'Quinn did in 'Stepfather 2.'",Rotten
Old Dogs is -- quite simply -- the nadir of filmmaking.,Rotten
It ain't as bad as you heard. I laughed a few times. Travolta and Williams are amusing.,Rotten
Getting your uvula pierced would be less painful than watching Old Dogs.,Rotten
A weary hound of a movie.,Rotten
"Scat happens, man,' John Travolta and Robin Williams tell each other, when they realise the 'scat' they have smeared over their faces at an outdoor adventure camp is, in fact bear poop... Bear poop looks good, by comparison.",Rotten
"The movie is never remotely funny, but it excels at being creepy.",Rotten
Those expecting new tricks or even vaguely inventive laughs from Old Dogs or its two waning stars should heed the obvious cliche.,Fresh
"The old dogs of the title may refer to the not quite senior citizen leads, but it's a more apt description of the shopworn and laughless jokes occupying this woofer of a comedy.",Rotten
A Travolta family effort for laughs through blatant illogic and human behavior that has no link to the real thing.,Rotten
Old Dogs' astonishing lack of laughs remains its biggest deficiency...,Rotten
"Despite showing some potential as commentary on ageism, the light-hearted comedy often flounders in the formulaic and a premise that is more complicated than it needed to be.",Rotten

"Utterly abysmal, entirely laugh-free and hideously embarrassing.",Rotten

"Being a film critic is a wonderful job, but there are weeks when the bad film delirium strikes and we'd all be better off in straitjackets.",Rotten
The jokes are played painfully safe and not even the fleeting presence of a few a name faces detracts from the sheer inanity of the plot and outright creepiness of the film's central pairing.,Rotten
Both Williams and Travolta mug furiously and the kids need locking up.,Rotten
[Travolta and Williams] engage in a torrent of slapstick set-ups that are neither witty nor funny.,Rotten
You've never experienced horror until you've seen Robin Williams in a Speedo getting a spray tan.,Rotten
"A slapdash embarrassment of feeble age gags and cultural stereotypes, Old Dogs is at once crass, corny, amateurish, insulting, uninspired, deeply phoney and extraordinarily unfunny.",Rotten
It's perhaps wise to avoid this movie at all costs.,Rotten
"Old Dogs is a milestone in the [Travolta's] career, the moment when he trumped Battlefield Earth to make the worst film of his life.",Rotten

"John Travolta and Robin Williams are no strangers to shamelessness. But not even they can walk away from ""Old Dogs"" with a shred of dignity - a mean-spirited, insulting ""family"" film that essentially pees down its leg and calls it comedy.",Rotten
"Heartless, brainless and unable to do anything with what it does have to offer, Old Dogs doesn't know who it's for or what it's offering. It just needs to get made because people have to have something to do. Spare yourself and your kids.",Rotten
A cringe-worthy crude comedy that has more bark than bite.,Rotten
"It all plods along to a familiar happy ending that is supposed to leave its audience feeling warm and fuzzy. I'll admit the ending made me happy, because it signaled the end to this miserable movie.",Rotten
Irritatingly unfunny.,Fresh
"High concept and high budget, Surrogates adds astounding techno magic to ideas mooted in films like Multiplicity, Total Recall and I Robot, but fails to achieve the humanity the film champions",Fresh
a surprisingly strong entry into the ever-shrinking arena of serious sci-fi.,Fresh
"Surely Isaac Asimov, Philip K. Dick and Stan Winston must be tossing in their grave for what all their creative and innovative ideas have wrought.",Rotten
"Half-baked and generic, Surrogates is entertaining enough for what it is, but a bland take on what could have been truly special.",Rotten
"Imagine ""Gamer"" without the lucid plot and the designer nihilism but with the inscrutable storyline, nonexistent direction and somnambulant performances and you have this film in all its hacky non-glory.",Rotten
Particularly silly...the sort of emptily bombastic popcorn movie that might make you wish you had a surrogate to go and sit through it in your place.,Rotten
Surrogates is a compelling set-up buttressed by slick effects and impressive production values that ultimately proves to be as hollow and superficial as the technology it conjures.,Rotten
"Beyond providing an excuse to sometimes wear a creepy wig which Barbie's boyfriend must want back, why Willis picked the shiny, empty Surrogates as his sci-fi return isn't clear from the tepid results on screen.",Rotten
"Surrogates stays afloat by not taking itself too seriously, but also by recognizing that a movie about robots shouldn't look as if it were made by one.",Fresh
Director Jonathan Mostow makes the proceedings such fun that you're willing to forfeit the smart satire this might have been for the trashy adventure flick that it is.,Fresh
By mixing a detective story and futuristic robots the filmmakers were likely aiming for the next Blade Runner. They wound up with the next Battlefield Earth.,Rotten
"Just as the dystopian world the movie portrays is arid and specious, the movie itself is a mechanical sci-fi'er absent of logic or emotions.",Rotten
The film isn't shy about its feelings about technology - it's time to unplug. It laments a culture that medicates pain away and has its head in virtual realms.,Fresh
"A film about robots that might find its biggest fans among Luddites, Surrogates is an intense and eerily plausible sci-fi thriller.",Fresh

"It's cold, lifeless, and silly, and it takes itself far, far too seriously.",Rotten
The robotic surrogates go about their business in the most monotone way possible. That low energy hurts the movie.,Rotten

"Troubling news from the future: we'll perfect robotics, but still be unable to master a decent toupee.",Rotten
Harbinger of what should be coming.,Fresh
Mostow demonstrates an uncharacteristic lack of subtlety throughout that suggests a diminishment of skills for the man who helmed the crackerjack kidnap thriller Breakdown.,Rotten
"Surrogates leaves you wanting more, but is entertaining for the short run time.",Fresh
"Do the actors sound so robotic because they are playing robots well or humans badly? And did a machine write this dialogue? If so, could we please apply for an upgrade?",Rotten
"The film moves along so quickly, and the surrogate world look is so eerie.",Fresh
Bruce Willis has little to do but hit his predictable marks and mouth the generic dialogue.,Rotten
"Big, bloated and worst of all boring, it takes its relatively solid B-movie Philip K. Dick meets Japanese anime premise and does very little of interest with it.",Rotten
Surrogates creates a world it has little interest in exploring beyond the boundaries set by a fairly dull whodunit.,Rotten
Like Blade Runner re-imagined by a twelve-year-old.,Rotten

Parental Content Review,Rotten
Too often it feels like one of the robotic surrogates was left in charge of the scripting and directing duties for large portions of the movie.,Rotten
"A more cerebral thriller than your standard sci-fi fare, Mostow strikes just the right balance between in-your-face action and social comment on technology as a lifestyle.",Fresh
Surrogates is yet another film that got swallowed by the Hollywood machine and spit out the other side. It's a surrogate of itself.,Rotten
"Wasting the chance to be a great, resonant SF metaphor, Surrogates ultimately proves as bland and empty as its pretty mechanical protagonists.",Rotten
"Despite bumpy execution likely to have detractors yelling ""dj boo,"" Surrogates oozes possibilities.",Rotten
"The script is by the team that gave us Catwoman and the last two Terminator movies, which tells you all you need to know.",Rotten
"Fans of actual sci-fi literature will probably enjoy this more than fans of slam-bang action. But at less than 90 minutes, it's not long enough to bore the haters too badly.",Fresh
"There's fun robot stuff, some good philosophical ideas, and a brief, nutty Willis-Ving Rhames reunion 15 years after Pulp Fiction.",Fresh
"For all the inspirations, the pieces of better stories that this tale was concocted from, Surrogates never manages to be anything more than a poor substitute for the real thing.",Rotten
Broaches topical subjects with a meditative quality that blends nicely with its dark brand of not-so-far-off fantasy.,Fresh
"The beauty of Surrogates lies not so much in the somewhat conventional thriller plot, though it is efficiently crafted and keeps the audience guessing up to the end.",Fresh
"Asimov it isn't but, for crash bang wallop, Surrogates hits most of the right buttons.",Fresh
"Surrogates favours action-packed, empty-headed spectacle over credible, coherent plot and the brief running time leaves you wondering what they left on the cutting room floor.",Rotten
Set your brain to standby and you'll just about suck up this glossy dollop of Total Recall-lite.,Rotten
This disjointed if sporadically striking science fiction gives the impression of having been heavily re-cut.,Rotten
"A familiar feeling mash-up of many films, Surrogates is enjoyable as the slight popcorn chomper it's meant to be. Won't tax the brain overmuch, but is enjoyable as the modern day 1950's B-movie that it is.",Fresh
Bruce Willis sees robot surrogates instead of dead people in this fairly entertaining sci fi flick,Rotten
Throw away the Blackberry? Surrogates is yet another serviceable sci-fi whodunit about how our dependency on technology will be the ruin of us all.,Rotten
"While this sci-fi thriller has an intriguing premise, it's synthetic and superficial in its execution.",Rotten
"Because it's easy to spot the culprit, suspense gets short shrift here. That's surprising, for Jonathan Mostow delivered uber-suspense in 'Breakdown.'",Rotten
"While the film will make you contemplate the effects of technology on human interaction, the script is dull and one dimensional. The worst part is that it could have been great.",Rotten
One of the year's more entertaining sci-fi films.,Fresh
"It's halfway decent as a thriller, but it just doesn't bother to dig deep enough into its own concept to be very satisfying.",Rotten
"The ideas on display may prompt plenty of fruitful discussions in the coffee shop after the screening, but that still doesn't add up to a satisfying experience.",Rotten
"Has an initially intriguing premise and plenty of slick production values, but it suffers from style over substance, diminishing suspense, and a plot that feels too bland, inane and ultimately underwhelming.",Rotten

"While not as smart as it could be, Surrogates is thought provoking and mildly entertaining.",Rotten
High-tech robots threaten humanity in edgy sci-fi thriller.,Rotten
"Whatever the reason, Surrogates was shielded from the eyes of critics before its opening, and that's a shame. Because, whatever its flaws, it is a good movie.",Fresh
"If the whole point of this surrogate society is to appear as a perfectly beautiful avatar, why would Bruce Willis choose that ludicrous blond wig that looks like he plucked it off a mannequin at Boscov's?",Rotten
"If you didn't know any better, you'd swear that both the cast and crew of Surrogates were trying to make the worst movie possible.",Rotten
"Surrogates is entertaining and ingenious, but it settles too soon for formula.",Rotten
"The premise for this sci-fi actioner makes sense for about four seconds, after which you begin to wonder why everyone on the planet would willingly become a shut-in, how the poor are supposed to shell out for these high-tech androids, etc.",Rotten
"While the film can't escape its own robotic storytelling and inability to elicit a genuine emotion, it does deserve credit for keeping the focus on people, not robots.",Rotten
Give credit to filmmaker Jonathan Mostow for keeping the movie on track; give credit to star Bruce Willis for keeping a straight face.,Rotten
"If you keep your expectations low, there are some sci-fi pleasures of visual appeal to be had, but it's tough getting past director Jonathan Mostow's wet noodle brand of storytelling.",Rotten
"A failure of speculative fiction, of plot, and of good old fashioned action filmmaking.",Rotten
The picture trades in hoary Bruce Willis police procedural clichs and underdeveloped conceits.,Rotten
This play between the plastic and the organic asks if perfect safety is worth sitting in the womb of virtual reality for the rest of your life.,Fresh
"Every sci-fi and action flick clich is crammed in here and Mostow couldn't give a damn if you've seen them all before. He might not do them better, but he'll do them well enough.",Fresh
"An efficient, engaging B-movie parable that grapples with technology, civil liberties, terrorism, freewill and religious subtext all in 89 minutes. It's also a true rarity: A good movie in which usually bald Bruce Willis sports a full head of hair.",Fresh
fun entertainment and definitely worth seeing for fans of science-fiction/high concept films.,Fresh
This popcorn thriller has a bit of imagination blended in with the been-done-before action.,Rotten
The provocative Philip K. Dick-like premise deserves better than this warmed-over apocalyptic murder mystery.,Rotten
"This movie does what science fiction is supposed to do, but seldom does anymore, it makes a comment about today's society by taking current trends and carrying them to a profound technological conclusion.",Fresh
"The problem with the movie is that while the action is swift, the set design is polished and the running time is enjoyably lean, the film leaves behind too many unanswered questions in its quest to drive the action forward.",Fresh
Semi-plausible and semi-watchable futuristic (but still looking like today's world) dystopian 'save the world' sci-fi thriller.,Rotten

"Its humanity, some cool technology and Bruce Willis save this film from simply being a compilation of a zillion similarly themed ""too much technology"" lessons.",Rotten
Has all the get-up-and-go of a dead battery.,Rotten

"Good ideas rub up against bad ideas, and the result is a movie that is worth a look but could have been much more.",Rotten
...viewers with even a passing interest in science fiction will find something worth embracing here.,Fresh
"The end result is somewhat underwhelming. It's more of a novella than a novel, and hardly the science fiction action blockbuster audiences were expecting.",Fresh

full review at Movies for the Masses,Rotten
"I would have liked to explore this world more and not keep slamming into some convoluted scheme that defeats its own purpose. I had fun watching it, but I actually thought the movie was smarter than its plot.",Fresh
"Sure, it's made capably, in a technical sense. But it's banal, utterly predictable and often quite stupid.",Rotten
Yetta nudder cautionary tale issuing dire warnings about the pitfalls of technology run amuck.,Rotten
"Surrogates establishes an intriguing premise for exploring a world in which virtual life trumps physical reality, but the thematic potential is squandered in favor of a by-the-numbers police procedural.",Rotten
"A smart little genre outing, an endangered species in modern Hollywood. [Blu-ray]",Fresh
I wish I had a surrogate to watch it for me.,Rotten
A film that raises many interesting ideas but follows through on few of them.,Rotten
"Fails to land a killing blow that pays off the simplified mystery with any distinct urgency. It's a flawed film, but far from unbearable. Nothing a DVD director's cut couldn't fix.",Rotten
"Underneath its typical Hollywood exterior there is a decent movie waiting to shine through. But so much else is just typical of the genre, it's hard to summon any more enjoyment from it.",Rotten
"Ultimately, Surrogates isn't going to break any records, but it's the kind of movie I'd stop at while channel surfing and watch the whole thing on a Saturday afternoon.",Fresh
"Sleek and shiny but ultimately lifeless, an interesting premise becomes terribly humdrum in this sci-fi thriller. There's nothing to offend, but little of note either.",Rotten
"Somewhere in the super-boring part, they add a clich√© twist to the already clich√© plot, and if you give it even a tiny bit of thought, an ending you can spot within the first 15 minutes. I walked out entirely disappointed.",Rotten
Requires the letting go of logic and a certain surrendering to the wonder of technological potential in the world.,Rotten
the entire enterprise has fallen short of its muddled ambitions.,Rotten
Add watching The Promotion to the Geneva Conventions' list of humanitarian abuses.,Rotten
"Precise, clever, wonderfully strange, and so funny it hurts, it is simply the best studio comedy since The 40-Year Old Virgin.",Fresh
"The Promotion isn't very original but it is, more often than not, funny.",Fresh
"Formulaic structure, inconsistent tone, and underwritten roles overshadow the few merits in the feature directorial debut of Conrad, who made a stronger impression as the writer of The Weather Man.",Rotten
"I predict that when this film is released, lots of critics who miss the point will complain about its muted tone. Scott and Reilly actually underplay the comedy to great effect.",Fresh
"A fantastic little comedy, filled with all sorts of weird moments, funny quips, colorful characters, and strange diversions.",Fresh
Doesn't match the brilliance of Mike Judge's 'Office Space' but has enough amusing moments to merit your look.,Fresh
"The Promotion, beyond what's a deeper screenplay than some may give it credit for, is consistently funny in a build-up-and-release way that, much like The Weather Man, supplements those one-liners with uncomfortable behavior and a comedy of manners.",Fresh
Saying The Promotion's tone is all wrong would imply that it had a tone to begin with.,Rotten
"Muted bits of slapstick and verbal insults arrive with more clunkers than zingers, but the performances are adequate and the tone sincere.",Rotten
Mature satire has unexpected brains and heart.,Fresh
"At last, we have a completely and profoundly American movie with all the classical skills of timing, editing and character development that we associate nostalgically with some Hollywood golden age.",Fresh
"Not that there aren't some great laughs, but this is far from the laugh-a-minute yuck-fest some might expect.",Fresh
The film is so restrained and deadpan that it barely seems alive,Rotten
If you think latent racism is just plain hysterical.,Rotten
"Not much here is funny, the Chicago locations are drab, and the characters, as ordinary as they are, never develop into anything more than premise props.",Rotten
"Despite its gimmicky-sounding premise, The Promotion is, like most of Conrad's work, less concerned with matters of winning or losing than with man's sometimes noble, sometimes deplorable, often futile attempts to distinguish himself from the herd.",Fresh
"This notable, Chicago-filmed comedy was inspired by the true events of director Steve Conrad seeing a store employee at a Chicago chain armed only with a yellow courtesy vest break up some unruly loiterers in the parking lot.",Fresh
"The Promotion edges toward some pretty bleak stuff. Then it steps back and laughs, like an office slacker.",Rotten
"Here's a weird little comedy... Kind of like Clerks in a bigger store, or at least a funny version of Employee of the Month.",Rotten
"Steve Conrad's wry debut takes place in an urban Chicago grocery store, in which an intimate epic of manhood unfolds.",Fresh
"A smart, understated comedy about two assistant supermarket managers making a bid for the one big promotion they both desperately need.",Fresh
"There's something appealingly modest about The Promotion. It's a sweet, human movie.",Fresh
It's a little pat and shallow.,Rotten
Easily the worst movie I've seen so far this year.,Rotten
"There's still a lot to like here, but ultimately the movie reflects its hapless hero a little too well. While we're constantly rooting for it to succeed, the finish line seems forever out of reach.",Rotten
"Conrad has the humanity part down. Even if his little film is something of a mess, that counts for something.",Fresh
Isn't as broad as its premise might suggest.,Fresh
It's one of those off-balance movies that seems searching for the right tone.,Rotten
"Think of it as a polite, tightly muzzled Clerks.",Fresh
"Although pacing and rhythm of some scenes are wildly uneven, this is a respectable debut behind the camera and a smart independent comedy that needs strong marketing to find the kind of savvy audience willing to give this odd duck a fighting chance.",Fresh
"Fueled by a sense of economic desperation that's all too familiar, The Promotion may wind up being the funniest, timeliest comedy of 2008.",Fresh
"By going easy on everyone, [director Conrad] turns what could have been a searing satire into a lukewarm comedy.",Rotten
A confident and clever character study about the commonality of dreams from the boardroom to the bag boy.,Fresh
better than the usual in so many ways,Fresh
"""The Promotion"" needs some career counseling to figure out just what it really wants to be.",Rotten
"So laid-back that it barely registers, despite starring two guys who haven't exactly been shrinking violets in previous outings.",Rotten
"A nasty-hearted little film, and in absolutely the worst way for a film to be nasty: it is absolutely convinced of its own warm spirit.",Rotten
"The Promotion uses the structure of a workplace comedy to pose gentle moral and ethical questions about treating people right (or wrong), about honor and ambition, truth-telling and back-stabbing.",Fresh
The portrayal of employment in America is too close for comfort. Or comedy...Not the stuff of lighthearted summer comedy.,Rotten
"Director Steve Conrad probably counts on the natural likability of Scott and Reilly to make this comedy go down a little easier, but it doesn't always do the trick.",Rotten
"As a subtle expression of masculine angst, it's the timid flipside of Fight Club. As a gentle critique of the American dream's descent into empty consumerism, it's a less cutesy, less feminist Little Miss Sunshine.",Fresh
"Two regular Joes square off in The Promotion, a sly comedy that finds fresh humor in the workplace.",Fresh
"The Promotion tries for the dry, low-key vibe of Election, but its humor is not so much dry as evaporated.",Rotten
"The directorial debut of Pursuit of Happyness writer Steve Conrad, The Promotion carries a deadpan corporate-absurd whiff of Office Space but never quite scans.",Rotten
Screenwriter Steve Conrad's (The Pursuit of Happyness) directorial debut is too strait-laced for the Knocked Up set and too offensive for the Will Smith crowd.,Rotten
"The strangely paced drama/comedy never finds much of a groove. Elements of conventional madcap comedy butt against more indie-ready scenes of relationship dysfunction, and the end result is more frustrating than interesting.",Rotten
"Reilly and Scott richly mine their characters, alternately confiding in and undermining each other. Their vulnerability and yearning for the good life is a quiet but powerful statement that will stay with you long after the closing credits.",Fresh
The Promotion has more work-life truth in it than a month of The Office or Dilbert.,Fresh
[Director] Conrad seems to have used whatever clout he got from The Pursuit of Happyness to fund something personal and sincere -- a story that's ultimately about victories of character and suppressing your worst impulses.,Fresh
As bad as a severe case of the Mondays.,Rotten
"The acting, not Steve Conrad's bland writing and uneven pacing, drives this low-key, mildly amusing, occasionally insightful workplace satire.",Rotten
Total and forgettable and unforgivable blandness.,Rotten
"The Promotion skates out onto that thin ice of comedic subtlety. Like its characters, it's not terribly successful, but it's an admirable effort all the same.",Rotten
Tone and pace are absolutely crucial to comedy. If the tone is wrong or the pace is off - by even a hair - the comedy will shrivel up and die. And that's precisely what happens in The Promotion.,Rotten
"bills itself as a comedy, and elements of it do fall into that category, but at its core, this is an incisive and often merciless deconstruction of the American Dream",Fresh
"This is one of the more original movies of the year, and it's the rare film that's primarily about the workplace.",Fresh
Fizzles as a comedy and as an exploration of the stresses of work.,Rotten
"The Promotion works as a comedy because, in the depths of our dark hearts, we enjoy seeing the woes that beset our comic antagonists.",Fresh
The Promotion is generally harmless but boring.,Rotten
Fails as a comedy because it's less funny and interesting than it would be to watch stars Seann William Scott and John C. Reilly sitting in lawn chairs and talking for 90 minutes.,Rotten
"Easily one of the freshest, funniest comedies of the year.",Fresh
Two things are missing in this debut directing effort from writer Steve Conrad - a sufficient number of jokes and anybody worth rooting for.,Rotten
...sharp and intelligent...,Fresh
"A work-retreat sequence is hilarious, thanks to a scene-stealing supporting bit from Jason Bateman. And Reilly's convincing portrayal of the somewhat self-destructive Richard does make the whole thing watchable.",Rotten
...an odd yet compelling comedy...,Fresh
"The Promotion may not be much, and you get to know that supermarket uncomfortably well by the end of the 85 minutes. But as I say: He's an interesting writer.",Fresh
"By taking the time to make that connection with the audience, The Promotion ensures we'll forgive these guys anything -- and laugh along with them -- in their quest to advance their lots.",Fresh
A nice little comedy about what it takes to climb the corporate ladder and the toll such actions take on the psyche of a decent individual.,Fresh
The Promotion does sacrifice some comedy in its attempt at depth.,Fresh
"Sort of a Dilbert riff, only lower on the food chain.",Fresh
"A bit Alexander Payne social satire, a bit Mike Judge's ""Office Space,"" ""The Promotion"" keeps the laughter mostly low-key while addressing deflating truths about occupational angst -writer/director Steve Conrad's sturdy thematic stock-in-trade.",Fresh
Watching Notorious was like attending a 10-year high-school reunion and reliving the good old days when the future seemed so bright.,Fresh
"Woolard, making his acting debut, delivers an exceptional performance. If his countenance is a bit different, the manner in which he carries his size is spot-on, and he nails Biggie's vocal intonations.",Fresh
"It has terrific performances, a powerful soundtrack and eye-catching visuals.",Fresh
A rock-solid biopic with a foolproof rise-and-fall storyline and a warmly nuanced performance by Jamal Woolard as iconic rapper Christopher Wallace.,Fresh
"If there's something praiseworthy about Notorious, it's that it pulls off the remarkable, ignominious feat of making its deceased subject less likeable than one remembers.",Rotten
What's most annoying about Notorious is that whatever bad thing that Biggie ever does gets paved over by the end of the film.,Rotten
"In the first surprise of this short year, this little movie about a big rapper is a worthy testament to the man who would be B.I.G, and the first truly good Hip Hop biopic.",Fresh
"Notorious is a luridly unapologetic trip through the violence, hunger, verbal bravado, and money fever of the hip-hop world, which it views as both liberating and destructive (often for the same reasons).",Fresh
"Kicks off with the usual rapper braggadocio of a childhood on the cutthroat street corners, then slyly cuts to a chubby A-student nerd known as ""Chrissy-poo"" to mom Voletta.",Fresh
The untold side of the story haunts the frames of this standard-issue biopic.,Rotten
A sanitized treatment that embraces every cliche of musical biography without shedding much real light on its subject.,Rotten
"Notorious delivers nothing but clumsy filmmaking and a greatest-hits checklist, without offering insight into the man or his myth. If you don't know now...you still won't know.",Rotten
Notorious is merely pop product.,Rotten
"Notorious, a biography of the rapper Notorious B.I.G., transcends gangster-flick cliches because of the outsized talents of the artist and the actor who portrays him.",Fresh
Just buy the records; that's the point of this infomercial anyhow.,Rotten
Notorious doesn't quite convey how hip-hop felt in the '90s ... (but) it manages to put a few new scratches and stutters into the beats and breaks of the conventional pop-star movie.,Fresh
"An evocative recreation of a decade-past (!) time in music whose creative, cultural, and social influences continue to resonate in the landscape today.",Fresh
"If Notorious was meant to play as tragedy, it misses that mark by leaps and bounds. It's difficult to weep for a person who lived the years he was given as a rotten, big-headed soul with few, if any, redeeming qualities.",Rotten
"We may never find out who killed Tupac and Biggie, but whoever made this movie could be guilty of assassinating their memories and character",Rotten
This movie will inevitably come up short when compared to documentaries like the one about the similarly brief life of the far more prolific rapper Tupac Shakur.,Fresh
A reasonably well-crafted drama made with some skill and a lot of tenacity.,Fresh
"ignores what Biggie was, a great artist who believed in the power of storytelling, and transforms him into the flawed saint that he never was and, more importantly, never wanted to be",Rotten
It's as if the filmmakers didn't trust Woolard to carry the emotional weight of Wallace's story. They should have.,Rotten
The film's Achilles' heel proves to be this sense of survivor's guilt that's too often M.I.A.,Rotten
"Director George Tillman Jr. coaxes a nuanced performance from newcomer Woolard, who not only nails the rapper's inflections but also humanizes the bad boy with passion, pain and charisma.",Fresh
Feels like Biggie's Wikipedia page reformatted for the big screen.,Rotten
"A great rapper deserves a great biopic, but B.I.G. fans will have to settle for this merely passable one.",Rotten
"Notorious won't ever be mistaken for investigative journalism, but it will help solidify Wallace's legacy as a hip-hop innovator while also explaining it all to those who were unaware and providing a sentimental re-creation for the legions of fans.",Fresh
"There is an unexpected moral dimension in Notorious, which skims the basics of B.I.G.'s well-chronicled career as a rapper, while concentrating on his less-celebrated maturation as father and husband.",Fresh
"Notorious is an efficient biopic, and a celebratory exercise in nostalgia for hip-hop fans of a certain age.",Fresh
"Even when this 'authorized' movie biography makes you long for the 'explicit' version, Woolard's tour de force finds the human details that forged an artist and lets Biggie fly.",Fresh
"Turns Biggie Smalls into an unpleasant, thoughtless caretaker of urban hopes and dreams, encased within a film that seeks to dust off a profitable legend instead of challenging a controversial legacy.",Rotten
"What really saves Notorious are the performances of rapper Jamal Woolard, who captures some of The Notorious B.I.G.'s playful charm, and newcomer Naturi Naughton, who dazzles early on as the fiery Lil' Kim.",Fresh
"The rare music biopic that leaves you not just humming the songs but thinking about life and death, the strategy of fame, and the business of the business.",Fresh
"Notorious is a good film in many ways, but its best achievement is the casting of Jamal Woolard, a rapper named Gravy, in the title role.",Fresh
"There's something restrictive and reductive about the format of showbiz biopics that this film, despite great music and unique tale of the slain raper, doesn't fully escape.",Rotten
"If there's a guide book on how to create a standard rags-to-riches music biopic, the makers of Notorious must have memorized every page.",Rotten
"The best way to remember Biggie Smalls is to listen to ""Juicy"" or ""Things Done Changed"" or any of the virtuosic autobiographical raps in which Christopher Wallace paints his own world with more immediacy and wit than Notorious ever manages to muster.",Rotten
"Biggie is played well by newcomer Jamal Woolard, who not only looks the part but has the moves of a slick street rapper down.",Fresh
[Director] George Tillman Jr. and the two unknown film writers...are burying you in minutiae and putting way too much of a positive spin on the life of a common thug.,Rotten
A mostly laudatory account of a young musician's life and career that is calculated to put Wallace in a positive light.,Rotten
I kind of expect a puff piece with Sean Combs as the producer... pun intended.,Fresh
"Gritty, affecting rapper biopic is too intense for kids.",Fresh
"Notorious sticks pretty well to the actual events of Biggie's life, at least the famous ones, but it has little to say about the man that's not available on his Wikipedia entry.",Rotten
"Notorious is like a piece of well-crafted bling. It looks good, and facets of it shine, but behind the gilded facade there's not much there.",Rotten
"This tale of triumph and tragedy within hip hop's elite is intelligent, gripping and far less sensationalistic than anyone could have expected.",Fresh
"When it comes to the outsized character at its center, Notorious is the rich, complicated and affectionate tribute he deserves.",Fresh
"The best thing about Notorious is its across-the-board, excellent cast, especially the soulful Woolard and Mackie's mesmerizing work as the complex Shakur.",Fresh
"Lacks the irresistible bump of Biggie's music and the flow of his rhymes; unlike Wallace, the filmmakers don't create anything fresh from the elements 'sampled' from the art (in this case, musical movie biographies) of the past...",Rotten
For anyone looking for something as real or engaging as Biggie's music -- or a good introduction to it -- will be disappointed by this mediocre celluloid life-after-death.,Rotten
"It must have been an act of great restraint for Sean Combs to resist titling this film, about Chris Wallace, his close friend turned rapper and cultural icon, The Notorious B.I.G. -- The Sean Combs Story.",Rotten
"Notorious is surprisingly and pleasantly unflashy, a straightforward picture that makes a distinction between classiness and bling.",Fresh
The film might have been just another middling musical biopic had the lead role not been so perfectly cast.,Fresh
No fire in this tale about one of rap music's most notorious shooting stars.,Rotten
"George Tillman Jr.'s film may follow the well-worn path of many a musical biography. But spot-on casting, a light touch around the edges and affection for its subject makes this warts-and-all look at the big man with the big hits a winner.",Fresh
"There's no sense of reality, no feel of the streets, none of the raw zest and spark that spilled out of Biggie's music. This is the type of biopic Hollywood made in the '40s about people like Johann Strauss or Cole Porter: phony to its bones.",Rotten
"The script lets too much slide, and director George Tillman Jr. -- whose biggest films have been Soul Food and the Barbershop franchise -- abets it.",Rotten
"The film takes a greatest-hits approach to its subject's life story, condensing his rise to fame, fall from grace and steps towards redemption into an easily digestible narrative that entertains, but rarely enlightens.",Fresh
"Closer to Scorsese than Scarface, Notorious gives a heartfelt yet clear-eyed sendoff to the late Brooklyn rapper Christopher Wallace, aka Biggie Smalls aka the Notorious B.I.G.",Fresh
It's unlikely there will be a better dramatization of the Biggie Smalls story than this one.,Fresh

"Notorious is hagiography with guns, grass and flesh, but it's a kind of whitewash all the same.",Rotten

A vivid biopic of the larger-than-life rap star that doesn't require you be a big fan of the genre.,Fresh
"This flick smoothes out the roughest edges, drains off the rawness and blandly retraces the narrative arc of every musical biopic since The Jazz Singer.",Rotten
"Notorious is a game of dress-up, the Greatest Hits version of Biggie's life. But in the end, it fails to present a convincing argument of why we should care.",Rotten
"Notorious, directed by George Tillman Jr. with a sentimental touch, seems torn.",Rotten
"This engrossing biopic, throbbing with style and attitude, will likely add to his legend.",Fresh
"If you give this fictionalized film biography a try, you may find yourself caught up in his troubled and complicated rise to prominence -- like me.",Fresh
An enjoyably ridiculous entertainment about a pursy young man with mysterious sex appeal who turns the rap world on its ear.,Fresh
"[Director Tillman has] imbued Biggie's story with emotions that bring home the full arc of a tumultuous, complicated life. That's why you don't have to love hip-hop to be glad you've seen Notorious.",Fresh
"As presented by the filmmakers, Wallace was a jumble of contradictions which they do nothing to explain.",Rotten
[G]ives new depth of meaning to the word hagiography...,Rotten
"A hagiography of the late hip-hop star Christopher Wallace a.k.a. The Notorious B.I.G., this overlong biopic glosses over so much detail and avoids the real man so much, it's a fan-magazine profile gone B.I.G.-screen.",Rotten
"Although one may question how objective it is, considering it's produced by Wallace's mother and Sean ""P. Diddy"" Combs, 'Notorious' is explosive, fun and entertaining.",Fresh
"I can honestly see people hating this film but for fans of Biggie's music like myself, the film is a great memorial to one of the best rappers ever.",Fresh
Parental Content Review,Fresh
"The film's unhurried, uncompressed feel yields many juicy moments worth savoring.",Fresh
"Anyone looking for a dispassionate, evenhanded account of the life of Biggie Smalls will be disappointed, perhaps even dismayed, by Notorious.",Rotten
This is a disappointingly conventional film that offers up all the key moments of B.I.G's life and a lot of his music but which fails at making the case for the ultimate importance of either one.,Rotten
"A relentlessly-unapologetic immorality play about a bona fide ghetto gangsta' apt to entertain even Joe Six-Pack to the extent Middle America is inclined to buy into the Hip-Hop Generation's mantra, 'Don't hate the playa, hate the game.'",Fresh
"Biggie lived a HUGE life in only 24 years, but this film has two hours and never sells me. Isn't selling what Sean 'Puffy' Combs is supposed to be an expert at?",Rotten
"Notorious is a well-made, compelling, and ultimately humane film, even if you don't like rap music.",Fresh
"Even if we miss the thinking that went into the creation of Wallace's B.I.G.-ger-than-life alter ego, the movie's performances are exultant.",Fresh
I never bought into the chase-your-dream theme. The dream that Biggie sought was not anything that Martin Luther King would have taken pride in.,Rotten
"The movie leaves us with the sense that, twelve years after Biggie Smalls's death, a lot of people are trying to extract whatever profit or pride they can from the chaotic life of a young man who was, as he well knew, a work in progress.",Rotten
"If Milk set the standard for biopics in 2008, then 2009 is off to a strong start with Notorious.",Fresh
"For a hardcore fan of his music and his life, it rings true.",Fresh
"Failing to find a message to champion, this shiny, polished biopic glosses over many of the warts which continue to tarnish the accomplished rapper's legacy.",Rotten
It's always interesting to watch real life unfold.,Fresh
"Notorious manages to convey what made both ""Biggie"" and Christopher Wallace so memorable, in the process introducing the man and his music to a whole new generation of fans.",Fresh
"Even though it brings little that's new or innovative to the table, ""Notorious"" is a must for anyone even moderately interested in the history of hip-hop in the 1990s.",Fresh
"the first drama about a hip-hop star's personal and professional life, rather than the culture itself, and it is worthwhile.",Fresh
A hip hop hagiography that plays like a straight-to-TV movie.,Rotten
"As mainstream hip hop becomes ever more predictable, so do the biopics about its stars.",Rotten
"Notorious is undeniably entertaining and Woolard's excellent, but ultimately the film buys a little too much into hip hop's frequent misogyny and Wallace's enforced sainthood.",Fresh
"This is an MTV-friendly, slick and styled production that tells one version of a very murky story and does it with plenty of energy but little imagination.",Rotten
It's ultimately a generic music biopic.,Fresh
"Notorious plays even more conventional than Eminem's 8 Mile or 50 Cent's Get Rich or Die Tryin', with its TV movie predictability (rueful voiceover and all) taking the gangsta out of gangsta rap.",Rotten
"Shooting shy of scandal, Notorious turns the life of Biggie Smalls into an off-the-peg cautionary yarn. Aside from Woolard's larger-the-life lead turn, it's strictly B.I.G. for beginners.",Rotten
"It's a dim, poorly executed, eccentrically cast film and you'd be better off seeking out Nick Broomfield's 2002 documentary Biggie and Tupac.",Rotten
A fitfully fascinating rise-and-demise yarn that will probably leave hip-hop fans underwhelmed while also alienating middlebrow audiences hoping for an inspirational night out.,Fresh
"Although guilty of assuming too much pre-knowledge on the viewer's part, it's a solid rap opus that snarls down Eminem's 8 Mile with heavyweight confidence.",Fresh
"Before giving in to sentiment, the film struggles to make us like this talented man who never quite grew up.",Fresh
It's bang-average biopic fodder but fans will enjoy the attention to detail and hearing Biggie tracks on a cinema soundsystem.,Rotten
"A watchable, if admittedly one-sided, biopic with a handful of strong performances, though it rarely scratches the surface of its subject and wears out its welcome long before the end.",Fresh
"Jamal Woolard is an inspired piece of casting in the title role, not disguising sweetness behind the macho and arrogant gangsta facade.",Fresh
A hagiographical whitewash.,Rotten
"For his legions of fans there's nothing new to discover about their flawed, but musically gifted, hero in a movie that, for them at least, will only serve to add to his legend.",Fresh
Now in blows the myth of the myth: a brashly entertaining biopic.,Fresh
"This team have smoothed over the details of Biggie's rags-to-riches ascent, they haven't succeeded in making it terribly interesting.",Rotten
This film by George Tillman Jr is less about the street politics and more about the slushy soap opera going on at home.,Rotten
"This is Hollywood hagiography at its most patronising and preposterous - a product, as well as a celebration, of a diseased, materialistic culture.",Rotten
Fans of Biggie will find a thrill in watching Jamal Woolard bring him back to life after death.,Fresh
"The boasts get louder, the bling shinier, but the film itself just gets increasingly monotonous.",Rotten
"This glossy bioflick of late hip hop legend Christopher 'The Notorious BIG' Wallace - aka Biggie Smalls, or 'Chrissy-poo' to his momma - is unlikely to trouble the Academy.",Rotten
"Like Violet Kray producing a film about her twin sons. The movie doesn't ignore its subject's shortcomings, but it sentimentalises them and becomes increasingly incoherent as it proceeds.",Rotten
"The inclusion of real-life footage and re-enacted YouTube clips is an interesting idea, but with each awkward stab at a new shooting style, Tillman Jr moves closer towards disgracing his subject with yet another hack job.",Rotten
A swaggering delve into the life of the biggest of all rappers.,Fresh
"It isn't the most subtle movie, with characters constantly spelling out the big message - in order to change the world, you first have to change yourself.",Fresh
"A big, bad bundle of biopic cliches, a glitzy whitewash filled with wince-inducing dialogue and propelled by a smug, from-beyond-the-grave voiceover.",Fresh
There is little here to attract anyone but the core fan-base.,Rotten
[An] intermittently entertaining but thoroughly conventional Biggie biopic.,Rotten
What might have been an African-American gangland epic with a killer soundtrack treads safely as a run-of-the-mill biopic.,Rotten
"Notorious is a pretty standard biopic, and is probably largely compromised. If you've never seen Nick Broomfield's excellent 2002 doco Biggie And Tupac, you'd be better served hunting that down instead.",Rotten
"While the script provides ample illustrations of Wallace's tough life, there is not enough focus on what set the recording star apart from his peers or why he became so incredibly popular so quickly.",Rotten
"While it's now less a case of race than class in black film, Notorious seems to still be taking tabloid cues more from alien ghetto underclass drama and what's come before, rather than bringing new and improved insight to the table beyond the cool music.",Rotten
"You've heard of laundering money? Well, this film biography of rapper Notorious B.I.G. has all the earmarks of--not monetary but morality cleansing.",Rotten
Notorious is a tribute the rapper's contribution to pop culture.,Fresh
"Though it never quite devolves into pure hagiography, the film's central tale of crack dealer made good is sometimes a little too hokey for its own good.",Rotten
"Absent the actual music, Notorious would be a lot worse.",Rotten
"This film knows the lyrics, but not the music.",Rotten
"Newcomer Jamal Woolard is a natural as the mammoth rapper, easily adopting Biggie's cheeky swagger and rasping speech... [But] the story suffers as it tries to capture every last moment of the rapper's life.",Fresh
There's not many surprises here for fans of the big man or those new to his work but the music is great and a major + point is that Sean 'Puffy' Combs (Derek Luke) is the film's producer.,Fresh
This so-bad-it's-actually-almost-brilliant biopic has an endearingly dodgy way of softening up hard facts.,Fresh
Woolard also performs much of the film's music.,Fresh
Bernie Mac's last film before his untimely death is a let-it-rip irreverent comedy invested with Bernie's trademark brand of earthy humor.,Fresh
"A combination road movie, musical excursion, and comedy is marred by the tedious bickering of the two lead characters.",Rotten
Cannibalizes both the Stax/Motown era of soul music and the shopworn road movie with an equal lack of freshness.,Rotten
"There's a nice chemistry between Mac and Samuel L. Jackson in this latest variant of the road movie, which contains comedic elements but actually works better as a drama.",Fresh
"The plot outline for Soul Men could fit comfortably on a single note card, with room left over for a grocery list and a few phone numbers.",Rotten
"The late Bernie Mac scores big laughs in this raucous, music-filled comedy.",Fresh
"Jackson and Mac click. They're perfectly believable as 'funk comrades' from back in the day, polyester princes reduced to asking for the AARP discount when they hit hotels they once trashed in the best rock-star tradition.",Fresh
Soul Men is the most disappointing tribute to black pop music since the OutKast movie Idlewild.,Rotten
"It's just another grumpy-old-men grousefest with a gooey center, like The Sunshine Boys or The Bucket List. Even its musical nostalgia comes off as more concocted than felt.",Rotten
"(Mac) uses his comedic talents to the best of his ability, leaving a lasting impression for the audience to cherish and take home with them.",Fresh
This is not just one of the worst movies of the year (which it would have been whether Mac and Hayes were still alive or not) but one of the most depressing movie-related experiences that I can recall having in a long time.,Rotten
If the Weinsteins had any soul themselves they would take this film and bury it along with every other film they seem to these days instead of trying to cash it in as some misbegotten tribute to Bernie Mac's legacy.,Rotten
"It'd be a step up if we could call this a poor Odd Couple knockoff, but it's not even that good: it's more like a juvenile grossout comedy for oldsters...",Rotten
Too many of the jokes rely on bad language and gratuitously outrageous behavior. Jackson and Mac have moments together that add some fun and even a little bit of soul.,Rotten
"No matter what else is going on in Soul Men, it's difficult not to be moved by the posthumous performances of Bernie Mac and Isaac Hayes",Fresh
The only laugh in this demeaning film filled with vulgar language is unintended; the amateurish scene trying to hide the fact that neither Jackson nor Mac can dance.,Rotten
"All told, Soul Men is not much of a legacy for Mac or anyone else, but he's sporadically endearing in the role.",Rotten
a fitting accolade to a fallen funnyman,Fresh
"Soul Men is a raucous, rambling comedy, offering some laughs, some groans and a feast for fans of the musical idioms it mocks and celebrates.",Fresh
"It doesn't sound like the likeliest pairing, but it works surprisingly well. Samuel L. Jackson and the late Bernie Mac make a winning duo in the bawdy buddy road-trip picture Soul Men.",Fresh
"Anyone who had affection for the late Bernie Mac would have a hard time not enjoying his last performance, no matter how cliched and trite this buddy road movie is.",Rotten
"A tribute to a musical era gone by as well as Mac's career, Soul Men is highly imperfect but also hugely enjoyable.",Fresh
Fans of Bernie Mac won't want to miss his final screen performance. Everyone else need not bother.,Rotten
"Though this is far from Mac's most memorable work, his appealing performance will undoubtedly remind the audience how much he'll be missed.",Fresh
Soul Men is pure mediocrity.,Rotten
"A funny picture, just not a consistent one, starting Bernie Mac's good-bye tour on a delightfully rowdy note, while reminding the viewer that as hilarious a man as he was, Mac had lousy taste in screenplays.",Rotten
Soul Men is a chance to salute these masters of mirth and music. Take it.,Fresh
No one could accuse Soul Men of originality -- it cribs liberally from countless buddy films and road movies -- but it offers enough energy and humor to overcome its shortcomings.,Fresh
"There are moments of comedic fire that justify the presence of the two stars in the film, and us in the theater.",Fresh
You want a good time? Soul Men will provide it. You want to say goodbye to Bernie Mac? He wants to say goodbye to you.,Fresh
"Soul Men is a raucous send-off for the late Bernie Mac, a gleefully profane take on the road-trip movie that earns its R rating early and often.",Fresh
Crude and unfunny...less fitting tribute than major disappointment.,Rotten
"This tale of old pros quickly turns into amateur hour, with comedic hijinks way, way below the sort of situations these two vets should have to deal with.",Rotten
Late great Bernie Mac's last laugh is for adults.,Fresh
"If Jackson and the late Bernie Mac weren't chewing up the scenery in an incessant game of one-upmanship, this might have worked nearly as well (as The Blues Brothers).",Rotten
Soul Men just doesn't find the right rhythms.,Rotten
"what else would you expect from the director that gave us this February's pinnacle of cinema tripe, Welcome Home Roscoe Jenkins?",Rotten
This is a perfect example of what happens when you try to combine 2 dramatically different tones into one movie.,Rotten
A muddled effort that strains to come together.,Rotten
"The movie crams in myriad needless subplots -- ostensibly to provide padding, which only draws attention to how thin the original story really is.",Rotten
The flick is nothing special but it is a great light for Bernie Mac to go out on. He was able to be as filthy as possible.,Fresh
What keeps this medium-grade formula picture from coming to a complete stop are the precious crumbs of genuinely funny comedic banter between well-paired stars Samuel Jackson and Bernie Mac.,Rotten
"In spite of its title, the film has precious little soul, but its real offense is being Mac's final on screen credit.",Rotten
"'Soul Men' is not only a tribute to Mac and Hayes, but the film is also funny, often outrageously crude, and pleasurable.",Fresh
"Unfortunately, [it's] not good enough to make up for the unnecessary proliferation of Viagra humor, rectal-exam jokes and comedy at the expense of women.",Rotten
"Bernie Mac's penultimate feature is a soul movie with genuine heart, a crowd-pleasing comedy that leans more heavily toward laughs for the majority of the running time, yet still manages to draw the viewer in with a slightly more earnest subplot.",Fresh
Samuel L. Jackson continues his tradition of inventive facial hair in Soul Men. And his tradition of appearing in movies unworthy of his talent.,Rotten
"While it's a shamelessly mediocre movie, it's not mediocre in the usual ways.",Rotten
"Soul Men has a lot to overcome in its effort to be funny. The pall over it can be ignored only intermittently, at least for the time being.",Rotten
The only good reason to see the otherwise dismal comedy Soul Men is to have a look at the late actor and comedian Bernie Mac in one of his final screen roles.,Rotten
So why is this film worth seeing? Because it's an ideal showcase for Mac's peerless comic chops.,Fresh
"Director Lee bets everything on chemistry, and gets a decent pay-off from the casting of Jackson and Bernie Mac.",Fresh
Soul Men casts the best possible leads in the worst possible movie.,Rotten
We've heard this tune before.,Rotten
"Sort of a riff on The Sunshine Boys with hints of Dreamgirls, about all Malcolm D. Lee's relentlessly crass comedy has going for it are some amusing Motown-ish numbers and the chemistry between Mac and his real-life friend Samuel L. Jackson.",Rotten
"It grieves me to report that Bernie Mac's posthumous movie release, Soul Men, hardly does the great comedian justice.",Rotten
"Ultimately, Soul Men achieves modest goals comedically and soars high musically, and it deserves credit for that.",Fresh
"That Soul Men proves an entertaining-enough diversion has less to do with the pedestrian screenplay and direction than the high-wattage, crowd-pleasing showmanship of Mac and co-star Samuel L. Jackson.",Fresh
Mac and Jackson clearly have such a blast singing and dancing you can't help but feel their groove. The rest of the movie should have jived as well.,Rotten
"Bernie Mac's death doesn't make Soul Men any better, but it may make it worth seeing.",Rotten
"There's a raunchy energy to Soul Men that cannot be denied. Even if the film is derivative, predictable, visibly low-budget and crude, it's also darn funny a good deal of the time.",Fresh
"There's nothing here you haven't seen before, but the genuine and infectious chemistry between Mr. Jackson and Mr. Mac and the irresistible energy of their performances is more than enough to give the movie real heft and momentum.",Fresh
Mac was a magnetic performer with a long history of redeeming mediocre movies; unfortunately this is another one.,Fresh
"Samuel L. Jackson and Bernie Mac appear to be having a good time, and for most of this raunchy, poorly orchestrated buddy comedy, that's enough.",Rotten
"When it succeeds, it's because of Mac and Jackson, two performers who give their all even when the material is measly.",Fresh
"Instead of establishing a consistent comic rhythm, Mac and Jackson spend most of the film's 103-minute runtime yelling at each other.",Rotten
It's the script and not Floyd that needs a shot of Viagra.,Rotten
Parental Content Review,Rotten
"Another one of those movies that should have stayed the course with the comedy, instead of steering into the iceberg known as drama",Rotten
"Mac could have wished for better for his final film, but this is a picture about entertainers and damned if he isn't one",Rotten
"...a sweet and occasionally funny, but over-amped and limply constructed comedy...",Rotten
"This isn't the perfect buddy flick, but ""Soul Men"" is a perfectly acceptable tribute to the late Bernie Mack, a talented comedian/actor who died too soon.",Fresh
"A tender, tangy and wild tale in a kooky convergence of music, memory and male bonding blues. And a movie truly about lasting impressions, where you're very likely to laugh till you cry, when not the other way around.",Fresh
A definite + is the sense of nostalgia generated by the movie's postscript affectionately acknowledging the passing of both Bernie Mac and Isaac Hayes.,Fresh
"Considering the canvas the story provides, and the richness of the tradition it taps into, the amount and quality of the music is pretty disappointing.",Rotten
"This one's only fair, but it has its low-down wiles and its moments.",Fresh
"It is not a perfect film but it is a nice, solid reminder of how great Bernie Mac was.",Fresh
It really is bittersweet to watch Mac in one of his final performances. He makes the most of pretty average material here.,Rotten
"This may not be a great movie, but I still couldn't help falling in love with it.",Fresh
Soul Men could have been so much more.,Rotten
"Mostly, the film works, due largely to the bickering, grumpy-old-men dynamic between the two leads.",Fresh
Bernie Mac can say MF too.,Fresh
Sam Jackson and Bernie Mac look positively pained when they squeeze into Pip-like suits and begin to sing.,Rotten
Nothing great comedy or drama happens in Soul Men. The pleasure comes in seeing Samuel L. Jackson and the late Bernie Mac do their stuff.,Fresh
...a bittersweet pleasure thanks to the two stars.,Fresh
Soul Men spins an erratic tune.,Rotten
"'Soul Men' is a mediocre film at best, buoyed by the abrasive chemistry of Bernie Mac and Samuel L. Jackson.",Rotten
"Awkwardly sentimental but nevertheless sharply spry in song and sass, Lee's acid-tongued Soul Men certainly have something to sing about.",Fresh
"The filmmakers chose to go too often to the well, I mean the toilet, for inspiration.",Rotten
Are there two other actors who are able to utter the word 'motherf**ker' with such forceful comic authority? I think not.,Fresh
Be prepared to laugh out loud and move to the music as Soul Men has plenty of both to offer.,Fresh
"Soul Men may get by on novelty, but what novelty!",Fresh
"In the end, its lack of originality and extremely low sense of humor keep Soul Men down a lot further than it deserves. There's potential there, but it's never realized.",Rotten
"Occasionally funny, frequently toe tappin', and sporadically a jumbled mess.",Fresh
"John Cusack is the voice of Igor, a hunchbacked laboratory assistant to the doomed mad scientist Dr. Glickenstein (voiced by John Cleese), in this irresistible animated comedy",Fresh
"for riffing so expertly on classic horror flicks, and for plumbing the depths of horror in the relentless perkiness of ""Tomorrow"" from the musical Annie, it deserves a medal",Fresh
"With its belabored gags, misfired pop-culture references and garish visuals crammed together like so many disjointed body parts, this manic kidpic cranks up the annoy-o-meter early on and rarely lets up.",Rotten
"Although the visuals tantalize and the actors providing the voices add a lot of sass, the result is only so-so.",Rotten
"Sweet-natured but saddled with strained wisecracking humor and over-busy plotting, Igor never quite manages to shake off a feeling of familiarity.",Rotten
"With nearly non-stop laughs from an amazing cast, an excellently written, thoroughly surprising story line with images you never thought you'd see in an animated feature before and top notch animation, there is no way you can lose.",Fresh
Mad-scientist comedy is fine for younger kids.,Fresh
"Igor tries to spoof Mary Shelley just as Shrek did the Brothers Grimm, but something tells us this movie's charmless hero won't make an ogre-size impression on kid audiences. Call it a hunch.",Rotten
There's enough good stuff here that a better 'toon could have been stitched together from the many promising funny parts.,Rotten
"A potentially original premise and an eager voice cast led by John Cusack and Molly Shannon are left to decay amid a clunky story vaguely reminiscent of Monsters, Inc. and images often resembling visuals rejected from Tim Burton's Corpse Bride.",Rotten
... a haphazard collection of spare movie parts cobbled together in a pale imitation of better-animated comedies.,Rotten
"Director Anthony Leondis peppers his tale with a host of leaden cinematic references children will almost surely miss, which is just as well since virtually every film-related gag directed at adults feels like a pitiful attempt at knowing cleverness.",Rotten
"Some of the nasty jokes may seem shocking with young ones around, but they'll keep adults awake through the utterly, painfully familiar three-act snoozefest.",Rotten
This monster mishmash is less than a graveyard smash.,Rotten
"While this is no WALLE, or Ratatouille, it does bring to mind Monsters, Inc. and some of the visual flair of Burton's The Corpse Bride.",Fresh
Even the desolate future envisioned in this summer's hit Wall-E has more immediate appeal for kids who might not be familiar with the source material for Igor.,Rotten
"While the stitches holding together the plot are clearly visible, Igor breathes some enjoyable life into its stolen grab-bag of gimmicks.",Fresh
"Director Tony Leondis and screenwriter Chris McKennna have mined everything from Young Frankenstein to Sleepy Hollow to Japanese anime to the German Neo-Expressionists to create that rare thing, a cartoon for adults.",Fresh

"My kid went with it, and I had a fairly good time, as I waited for the reappearance of a marble-mouthed peasant tart, voiced by Jennifer Coolidge. Half the time her line readings are hilarious, and it's impossible to know why.",Rotten
"A completely original concept, a Frankenstein 'toon that's clever enough to please both kids and their parents (for a change).",Fresh
"To convince you that it's full of surprises, the movie throws in Louis Prima songs where they don't belong, and it riffs on classic monster-movie cliches mostly by spinning them into newly unfunny cliches.",Rotten
"While not quite as alive as I'd wish, this is still a movie with more electric creativity then a lot of other stuff I've seen this year, and as far as kids are concerned this is one experiment worth letting them conduct by themselves.",Fresh

"It won't disappoint you. That's rare, don't you think?",Fresh
Writer-director Cary Fukunaga keeps the story lean while peppering it with realistic details.,Fresh
"Fukunaga's gift lies not in inventing clever reversals, but in declining to provide us with the typical cinematic cues that advertise what's coming.",Fresh
Among the film's many revelations is a cast of talented unknowns who stand to become much better known in years to come -- which makes the 'no name' title seem almost ironic.,Fresh

"You might think you know where these characters are going, and how the various plot threads will be tied up. But you'd be wrong.",Fresh
"A very southern modern Western, the Spanish-language Sin Nombre offers a treacherous frontier, a conflicted outlaw and fine performances by actors with whom the camera clearly is besotted.",Fresh

"Fukunaga paints better outside the lines, working with cinematographer Adriano Goldman to offer vivid shots of the poverty and despair cutting through Latin America.",Fresh
Sin Nombre is pure filmmaking: a great story told in beautiful images.,Fresh
"It's a documentary-style look at the harrowing journey illegal immigrants take to get into this country, but it's also a tightly plotted thriller.",Fresh

"While this Mexican import is treading familiar territory, first time writer/director Cary Fukunaga comes at it with fresh eyes.",Fresh
What makes it unique among films that cover similar subject matter is the restrained acting and richness of its visual sense.,Fresh
This is a very fine film debut.,Fresh

Captivatingly naturalistic performances and cinematography almost makes up for the lack of a larger political framework.,Fresh

Sin Nombre is a riveting watch and an expertly directed drama that will stay with you long after you leave the cinema.,Fresh
"Gorgeously shot and edited, and performed with a gentle emotional openness, this gritty odyssey tells a deeply personal story while examining much bigger issues in Central America and beyond.",Fresh
It's such an accomplished and powerful piece of storytelling that Sin Nombre - which means Nameless - could easily find itself in the running for the Best Foreign Film Academy Award.,Fresh

"Far less would have been much more, though the geriatric protagonist's salty sexual wit and impulse to share a joint with a passing stranger, spice up the often dreary chronological procession of family episodes.",Rotten

Ross Bagdasarian's enduring characters are a bit tougher to endure in this charmless sequel.,Rotten

"Watching talented, funny people like Zachary Levi, David Cross and Wendie Malick go from one demeaning and painfully stupid situation to the next is excruciating.",Rotten
The earlier Alvin movie made more than $217 million just in the United States. It's hard to imagine this somewhat confused sequel doing as well.,Rotten
Its young target audience will find this latest Chipmunks iteration entertaining. The story is simple enough for little kids to follow and at 88 minutes the movie does not wear out its welcome.,Fresh

The story is so paper-thin one surmises it was scrawled on soggy toilet paper somewhere,Rotten
"Whatever limited charms the first version had -- mostly David Cross' portrayal of Ian, the greedy manager who exploits the furry creatures -- have since soured.",Rotten
Will kids eat up this cutely fractious claptrap? Of course they will. They'll eat up whatever you put in front of them. But that doesn't make The Squeakquel good for them.,Rotten
"Betty Thomas delivers pretty much the bare minimum: peppy, brightly colored, tune-filled nonsense sure to meet the low, low standards of its pre-kindergarten core audience.",Rotten

"Every time an adult ended up in traction or broke wind, the three-year-olds in the audience were freshly ecstatic.",Rotten
"Whatever slim charms there were in the nostalgic, musically cute and slapstick-friendly first film of chipmunk mania are squished right out of The Squeakquel like so much rodent roadkill.",Rotten
"""Alvin & the Chipmunks: The Squeakquel"" is pure cinematic poison from start to finish and does roughly for holiday moviegoing what Irving Mainway's Bag O'Glass once did for holiday gift-giving.",Rotten

The whole thing is rather insipid. But Thomas makes it smoother and more palatable than it deserves to be.,Rotten
"The Chipmunks are as cute as ever here, but the plot is almost insultingly predictable, even for the youngest of viewers.",Rotten
"The Chipmunks, in the first film, were the mathematical creations of a computer; watching The Squeakquel, the fun of the first film fades away as you realize that this time around, you could just as easily say that about the script.",Rotten
"Harmless, diverting and forgivably silly fun that will delight kids while keeping adults awake and, for the most part, amused.",Fresh
"Zachary Levi is easily the single worst element of The Squeakquel, which speaks to the depths of annoyance the actor plummets to. The cartoons show more wit and ease with a punchline than this guy.",Rotten
"It's far from the most unpleasant kiddie flick I've sat through this year, although I would be misleading you if I promised you lots of laughs.",Rotten
"a half-assed, low-budget enterprise trading on children's endless appetite for talking animals",Rotten

"Kids will love this movie and %u2014 as history teaches %u2014 they love the chipmunks. It's fast-paced, has plenty of music, a really funny fart joke and a happy-ending life lesson.",Fresh
This is perfect entertainment for those who find 'Teletubbies' and 'Dora the Explorer' to be a little too highbrow.,Rotten
There are worse forms of torture.,Rotten
An unsatisfying sequel to a very mediocre first film. It is so unfunny and painful that I actually saw people walking out of the free screening I attended.,Rotten
"Fractious, family-friendly and funky, it's nevertheless cutsey charmless. Expect an inevitable Threequel.",Rotten

"Richard Widmark is dead but his spirit improbably lives on in this 'squeakquel,' in which the allegedly adorable harmonizing rodents cause an old lady in a wheelchair to roll down a steep flight of stairs...",Rotten
The film as a whole is only marginally less entertaining than playing roadkill Frisbee.,Rotten
"Yes, it's probably a good film for children. But when films far more sophisticated and enjoyable like ""Up"" or ""Where the Wild Things Are"" come out, a film like this merely seems trivial.",Rotten
Kids will love it but adults will squirm. A little squeak from the chipmunks goes a long way.,Rotten

"Blending CGI and live action, this ""squeakquel"" to the witless 2007 kids' film proves just how dangerous such technology is when placed in the wrong hands.",Rotten
"Like the Three Stooges, McHale's Navy, and the Brides of Funkenstein, the Chipmunks are a true pop-cultural sleeper sensation.",Fresh

"This could have been an emotionally wrenching film, but Desplechin keeps the tone light, infusing the drama with humor in the most unexpected places.",Fresh
There are no martyrs in this anti-sentimental ironic movie that nevertheless percolates with emotion and accepts its quirky characters for all of their flaws.,Fresh
"Blurring the lines between TV soap opera and tight narrative, Desplechin's multi-generational family saga is a bravura piece, based on witty writing, inventive storytelling, and superlative acting of a large ensemble headed by the regal Catherine Deneuve",Fresh
"By frontloading the dramatic meat of the story, the film becomes less about shocking revelations or plot twists than the sometimes comic, sometimes serious dynamics of a family under extreme strain.",Fresh
A gift that keeps on giving,Fresh
Arnaud Desplechin doesn't so much direct movies as conduct marathons.,Fresh
"A dysfunctional French family learning that `it is never too late to bring love, peace and healing into a divisive and unforgiving household.",Fresh
'A Christmas Tale' finds time for bits that have no reason but strike home as true.,Fresh
"Arnaud Desplechin's A Christmas Tale is an intricate, accomplished patchwork of sometimes nutty but always believable human behaviour.",Fresh
"Each in succession, the curiosities of A Christmas Tale burst from the surface of the film, almost incapable of containing themselves, their passions, their disappointments, their awkward eruptions of alcoholic rage and familial resentment.",Fresh
In working to keep the audience off-center...Desplechin artfully makes the well-worn family weekend plot endearing again. [Blu-ray],Fresh
"Overlong, but nicely paced with well-developed characters in both the principal plot and subplots",Fresh
"What's troubling is its lack of perspective on anything beyond the narrow, navel-gazing concerns of its characters.",Rotten
"Dense, energetic, occasionally indulgent but ultimately involving family drama, about the travails of a dysfunctional extended middle-class family who convene to celebrate Christmas, delivers gifts by way of a sterling cast led by Catherine Deneuve and Ma",Fresh
A Christmas Tale is a bad dream with just enough distance to give us a midwinter's night's laugh.,Fresh
"A Christmas Tale brilliantly captures the melancholy and familial recrimination that, for some people, is as much a part of the holiday season as fruitcake and egg nog.",Fresh
"A Christmas Tale (Un Conte de Noel) is a darkly comic dysfunctional family fairy tale, more Meet Me In Saint Louis than The Royal Tenenbaums, with a healthy dose of A Midsummer Night's Dream thrown in.",Fresh
"A Christmas Tale isn't repugnant, just regressive. The modern family film has moved beyond this Gallic update of I Remember Mama.",Rotten
"Out of the most ordinary ingredients -- an ailing mother, estranged adult siblings, a good meal ruined by bad behavior -- the endlessly inventive French filmmaker Arnaud Desplechin has made the old look fresh in A Christmas Tale.",Fresh

A Christmas Tale is a film experience to be seen and savored for its exquisite delineation of human feelings and foibles.,Fresh
"Dark secrets are unlocked, words draw more blood than punches, and [director] Desplechin turns one family into a universe that resembles life as a startling work of art.",Fresh
a work of intoxicating genius.,Fresh
"It's the definition of a film meant to be admired more than loved, but Desplechin's fierce intelligence and uncompromising sense of character come through.",Fresh
...like a stocking stuffed by the most inventive and mischievous of gift givers.,Fresh
Enduringly fascinating and involving.,Fresh
"Has as much emotional baggage as any soap opera but not an ounce of melodrama, exploring the cuts and letting us understand the scars.",Fresh

"The picture is so alive with familial love and intrigue, with the richness of human complexity, that you want to reach out and hug it.",Fresh
"A long, improbably funny and very beautiful film.",Fresh
Some wry humor runs through the course of the overly long saga. But there's not enough dark wit to mitigate the tedium and pretentiousness.,Fresh
"After two and a half hours in the thrilling, exhausting company of the characters in A Christmas Tale, the intimacy we feel with them is wired with surprise.",Fresh
"If Ingmar Bergman and Wes Anderson some how collaborated on a movie together, I'd guess their sensibilities would yield something like Arnaud Desplechin's darkly hilarious, brilliantly acted A Christmas Tale.",Fresh

"The characters' explosive emotions - tender and bitter, guilt-wracked and willfully inscrutable - make ""A Christmas Tale"" an edge-of-your-seat experience in a way most thrillers could only dream about.",Fresh

[A] gloriously shaggy dog of a family soap opera.,Fresh
"A sprawling, complex web of family betrayals, emotionally stunted relationships, disappointments, banishments and plain old eccentric behavior are clich√© by now, but in this movie it's all so frighteningly true.",Fresh
"Getting through these first 20 minutes is as necessary as plowing through the first 50 pages of a 19th century novel. Once that work is over, the movie's singular pleasures reveal themselves.",Fresh
"If Four Christmases is merely a stocking stuffer, this is the new car out in the driveway with the big red ribbon around it.",Fresh
The family's vulnerabilities and eccentricities burrow under the skin.,Fresh
A classic French family drama featuring fine performances by legend Catherine Deneuve and reigning star Mathieu Amalric even if the raging and crying might be a bit much for the Christmas season.,Fresh
"Once the connections become clear, however, this often bitter story almost becomes a thriller, as we fear the next outburst or revelation and its aftermath.",Fresh
"Watching A Christmas Tale is like getting to know a family other than your own by leafing through its scrapbooks and laughing at its photograph albums, while it bickers in the next room over stuff you may never understand.",Fresh
"I'd be more inclined to call this French dysfunctional family epic gabby and preeningly self-indulgent -- in a word, annoying.",Rotten
"A Christmas Tale is long but it exerts enough of a pull that the 150 minutes pass rapidly, if not necessarily painlessly.",Fresh
"Depslachin's film is not brimming over with good cheer, hardly, but it is warm and sometimes funny and refreshingly honest, illustrating the complicated beast that often is family.",Fresh
"Roiling with laughter, tears, drunken confessions, revelatory soliloquies, pain, sorrow, hospital visits, and various kinds of love, A Christmas Tale is a smart, sprawling, and sublimely entertaining feast.",Fresh
"It's a simple picture about complicated people, the members and sometime-combatants of the extended Vuillard family.",Fresh
"Characters occasionally address the camera, which helps disentangle the competing story lines of madness, adultery, and betrayal.",Rotten
There are simply too many marvels to tally.,Fresh
"The most emotionally rich and cinematically thrilling film I've seen all year, a film that pulses with human life in all its terrible and beautiful irrationality.",Fresh
"To tweak Tolstoy: All happy families may be alike, but all unhappy-family movies are entertaining in their own ways.",Fresh
"Even though it's pretentious and overlong, A Christmas Tale is still maddeningly engaging, thanks in large part to its attractive and gifted cast.",Fresh
"A Christmas Tale is beautifully acted by all. The bigger dramatic moments in the film are believable, but the occasional fights and arguments cannot hold a candle to the quieter moments of truth permeating out of the scenes.",Fresh
A good film with great performances that's only held back a bit by its extreme length and the pacing and pretentiousness that goes with it.,Fresh
A strangely encompassing collection of private moments among the members of a large family with a fraught history.,Fresh
"Call me nuts, but even with all the dysfunction and suffering, I found lots to cherish about this artistically personal holiday film.",Fresh
A picture of unpleasant people treating each other poorly that comes across as buoyant and frankly joyful at times.,Fresh
'A Christmas Tale' has revived my love for goofy families as only the French can do.,Fresh
"It leaves no lasting impression, except for one excruciating scene involving a bone marrow transplant.",Rotten
"Through a thicket of subplots..., Desplechin slowly and gracefully unfolds the damage done by years of bad blood.",Fresh
Filmmaker Arnaud Desplechin (Kings and Queens) and his co-screenwriter Emmanuel Mourdieu have created something that is rich with characters and themes.,Fresh
"Yet as the film progresses these multifarious layers of dramatic ennui and vitriol becomes absolutely intoxicating, and before I knew it my eyes were glued to the screen and I almost couldn't wait to see what was going to happen next.",Fresh
"Yet another dysfunctional-family, holiday-reunion film that's no better, no worse than its bourgeois predecessors - unless you happen to be a Francophile.",Rotten
...ultimately suffers from a middling midsection that's been suffused with pointless digressions and melodramatic crises...,Rotten
"A Christmas Tale's expansive stew of physical and psychological illness, death, betrayal, longing, religion, and ritual ultimately proves invigoratingly lush.",Fresh
[It] will make anyone dreading the holidays with their family grateful for what strife they may face. It's nothing compared to what the Vuillard clan gets up to.,Fresh
A minor masterpiece.,Fresh
"A triumph of willed optimism (or perhaps more accurately, of grudging good nature) over unhappy experiences...",Fresh
"Never devolves into a tedious two-and-a-half hours of self-examination. But it also never goes very far, either.",Fresh
Seems hardly like cheerful holiday fare but nevertheless goes down as richly as plum pudding.,Fresh
"At last, a great contemporary holiday movie that's strictly for grown-ups -- a holiday movie that really is a moviegoer's holiday from desultory daily fare.",Fresh
A CHRISTMAS TALE is your typical Holiday drama that's elevated by stylish direction and an infectious energy,Fresh
"As charming as the film's title sounds, here is a movie, distinctly French in its clipped rhythms and melodramatic arc, that's anything but charming. It is, in fact, a jumbled, caustic tour-de-force.",Rotten
A Christmas Tale is the yuletide antidote to Four Christmases.,Fresh
"There's a giddiness to this whirling dervish of a film, with its spastic skipping from character and catharsis, its near fetishistic camera trickery, bursts of song, and loving lifts from the likes of Vertigo and Nietzsche.",Fresh
"For people who find that movies that are full of sentimentality and sympathy set off their gag reflex, this is the holiday movie for you.",Fresh
A Christmas Tale seems less like a movie than a genuine family being observed.,Fresh
"If you want to see a Christmas story that's genuinely heartwarming and entertaining without ever slipping into phony sentimentality, you'd better learn to read subtitles.",Fresh
A warmly inviting motion picture.,Fresh
Consider it a post-holiday gift to yourself.,Fresh
"Arnaud Desplechin's sprawling family drama is sharply observed and superbly acted, but it's also far too long and fails to engage on an emotional level.",Fresh
A compellingly literate exploration of the muddle of misguided motives and lingering regrets that bind families together.,Fresh
"You could, of course, forgive the whole enterprise as the extravagances of an intellectual fairytale, but the film's wayward eccentricities outweigh its good performances and breezy telling of a jumble of a plot.",Rotten
What could have been the acme of talky dramas about the inner lives of French intellectuals turns out to be a feast of a movie.,Fresh
The film is almost as involving as it is infuriating.,Fresh
"The effect is strange, disconcerting - but never dull. I think what Desplechin has created is not a conventional drama, but a sort of dream-ensemble masque: a choreographed parade of ideas, emotions, personae. A film to ponder, and to savour.",Fresh
"The cast expertly incarnates this family haunted by loss, lovelessness and (literal) bad blood, but the film's unduly protracted duration makes the Vuillards feel like Christmas guests who just will not leave.",Rotten
"At a bum-numbing two-and-a-half hours, the film does at least have one thing in common with other Christmas visitors - it long outstays its welcome.",Rotten
"Typically Gallic, it contains lots of smoking, drinking and thinking. With the thoughts often turning towards death.",Rotten
"A Christmas Tale is a compelling domestic drama, a French art gem to inaugurate 2009.",Fresh
"Bustling and chaotic like most big families, this film really captures the outrageous collision of personalities in any gathering of relatives",Fresh
an endlessly busy and stylish film with a hollow emotional and spiritual core.,Rotten
The characters are so nutty that you never know what they will do next. That fact alone kept me interested.,Fresh
"Arnaud Desplechin's headfirst dive into the complex relationships within a middle class French family is a messy, captivating, and very much living affair.",Fresh
"A droll and frantic melodrama stripped of aesthetic contrivances but full of emotional ones, and it is affirming in its own way without being particularly cathartic.",Fresh
Controlled chaos of a family reunion highlighed by likeable but flawed characters,Fresh
Un conte de No√´l could use more of the surreal hilarity of Wes Anderson'sThe Royal Tenenbaums.,Rotten
"Un drama coral y familiar sobre relaciones disfuncionales, viejos rencores, odios y amores, enfermedad y muerte. Puede resultar tan desconcertante e irritante como sorprendente y humana. Lo innegable es la calidad de su elenco.",Fresh
Till life do us part,Rotten
The film (has) a sensibility that is paradoxically both old-fashioned and very modern.,Fresh
"There isn't a convincing note in the entire film, but there's no denying that each bit of dramatic fakery glitters and hums. A bit like Christmas itself, actually, which might just be the point.",Fresh
"Not very cheerful holiday fare? Turns out to be more upbeat than you'd think, without any angels or friendly ghosts, thanks to Desplechin's affectionate approach to his characters.",Fresh
Even Amalric's ray of light can't penetrate the gloom enough to make this much more than a rather strained actors' exercise.,Rotten
"The movie teems with the excitement of unwrapping a present, even as it deals more seriously with the intractability of blood ties.",Fresh
"As the rituals of Christmas are observed, the family edges closer towards a sense of understanding and acceptance in a picture that captures a sense of life's messy uncertainties and the way we sometimes hurt the ones we love the most.",Fresh
It's maddening and it's exhilarating.,Fresh
"A Christmas Tale's more universal qualities should be apparent to anyone who has survived a Christmas, and God help us, here comes another one.",Fresh
Its numerous narrative strands are neither revealingly pursued nor properly intertwined.,Rotten
"A Christmas Tale has a classical feel, even though the mischievous Desplechin tosses in shadow puppets, iris shots, and actors speaking directly to the camera. It's this ability to surprise that gives the film its spark.",Fresh
"Desplechin's film is so well cast and the relationships so authentically depicted that it's okay not to be completely or partially taken by Junon, Henri, and the rest of their kin.",Fresh
"A Christmas Tale is a lively, capricious, mischievous ensemble delight.",Fresh
"Despite occasional bouts of tedium over the epic course, a surprising buoyancy emerges: Desplechin's methods begin to inform, even brighten, the message.",Fresh
"Desplechin is an inspired impurist. His Christmas Tale is untidy, overstuffed and delicious: a genuine holiday feast.",Fresh
"Given his cornucopia of characters fighting wars on three fronts, his whiplash tonal switchbacks, his jazzlike aesthetic of chance, how is it that Arnaud Desplechin is only now coming home for the holidays?",Fresh
"[Desplechin] has skill, patience, empathy, and insight; quickened by the holiday occasion, they make the title of his film ultimately, if unconventionally, right.",Fresh
"It takes about half an hour of screen time, until everyone gets packed into the house, for A Christmas Tale to reveal its nature fully: expansive in narrative scheme, compact in emotional space and self-consciously auteurist to the core.",Fresh
"It's a bracingly eccentric, waspishly intelligent blast of flashbacks, freeze frames, split screens, and bizarre music choices.",Fresh
"Not since, well, Kings & Queen has calling something overstuffed been such a compliment.",Fresh
Perfect off-season timing for a wickedly off-kilter movie about a French family Christmas in extremis.,Fresh
"A Christmas Tale has bountiful charm in the first leg of the film, mainly because it is able to take a lovely, dry wit to its characters' bitterness.",Fresh
"Un Comte de Noel is a long, rambling story of a bourgeois family going into dysfunctional overdrive during a reunion at the parental home.",Rotten
If you are intrigued by the interpersonal relationships and entanglements of a family - maybe a lot like yours and mine - this film is a fascinating expos√© that might well prompt some seasonal self-reflection.,Fresh
"Arnaud Desplechin's mercurial, knotty and cinematically vibrant drama of family dysfunction stirred up over a Christmas gathering was my pick for best film of 2008",Fresh
"Catherine Deneuve, for her part, is luminous as always. But the entire film feels cold and distant, and fatally unfocused.",Rotten
"Though A Christmas Tale clocks in at 152 minutes, it never feels tired or fails to compel.",Fresh
"It's laboured and clunky, or crude and vulgar, when it should be funny and zippy",Rotten
"This glossy Hollywood piece is not for everyone as it joins the dots and goes for the obvious, but it's good natured enough",Fresh
An utterly predictable entrant in the Cougedy genre sees a yummy-mummy (Zeta-Jones) and her 25 year-old babysitter (Bartha) tumble into love after she takes her two young children to a new life in New York.,Rotten
"A charming and observant tone helps lift this above most romantic comedies, at least until the formula kicks in during the final rather contrived act. But until then, it keeps us happily smiling and sighing along.",Fresh
"Laughs are in short supply, and Mr Freundlich resorts to gross-out lavatory humour that's an unnecessary concession to youthful audiences who wouldn't like this movie anyway.",Rotten
"These are characters who seem very real. It's their imperfections, not contrived plot points, that drive the story.",Fresh
Why is a movie that's trying to evoke some of the cool metropolitanism of late-'70s Woody Allen so rammed with hoary gags about New York being awash with transvestites and homeless flashers?,Rotten
"Thanks to a mischievous humour and charming leads, it's surprisingly enjoyable. More Zeta-Jones rom-coms, please.",Fresh
"There is much about The Rebound that does not work, but you can't help giving it some credit for attempting to roam slightly outside the scope of most rom-coms, even if it can't entirely pull it off.",Rotten
"The romantic trials of two wealthy, good-looking people, whose only barriers to happiness are their own petty insecurities, become tedious, and it's not helped by some stilted dialogue and awkward, mannered performances.",Rotten
There are a few funny lines - especially when she goes on a cringey date with a slimy chiropractor - but there are also too many unlikely scenarios and clunky dialogue.,Fresh
"The positives of The Rebound vastly outweigh the minor criticisms. It's also not afraid to adopt a sudden tonal shift at a key juncture of the plot, which works fairly well.",Fresh
"ven slap-bang in the middle of the worst year for romcoms in living memory, The Rebound deserves a special boot up the backside for its raging incompetence.",Rotten
"It's not side-splittingly funny, or exactly emotionally trenchant, but Zeta-Jones and Bartha are both decidedly charming, even if there's a notable lack of sexual chemistry between them.",Fresh
"Zeta-Jones is always fun when she's bad, but she still hasn't found the right leading man to bring out her cuddly side.",Rotten
"Watchable romantic comedy, enlivened by good dialogue, strong performances and likeable characters, though it occasionally struggles to find the right tone and is let down by a hideously contrived ending.",Fresh
"The Rebound offers up surprisingly nice characters (too nice, you could argue) and a modest charm that compensates for a lack of big laughs or much suspense.",Fresh
Another faintly insulting rom-com promoting a marketing man's idea of what women really want from movies...,Rotten
"The Rebound is largely character-driven, which is more than a lot of romantic films can vouch for.",Fresh
"Saddling two game actors with a tone-deaf, charmless script, the film makes recent J.Lo vehicle The Back-up Plan look like Billy Wilder in comparison.",Rotten
An unromantic comedy that gets down and dirty.,Rotten
"Although it bears the marks of studio intervention, much of the blame remains firmly with Freundlich, who's incapable of arranging a single honest moment in this uncomfortable, frightfully strained creation.",Rotten
Poor writing and inconsistencies sink this film. Let's hope that Zeta-Jones and Bartha can rebound.,Rotten
...a thoroughly (and consistently) misguided piece of work that has almost nothing truthful or relevant to say about relationships.,Rotten
"The Rebound does nothing new but does it, for the most part, well. Zeta-Jones and Bartha have sweet chemistry together and it's refreshing to see her portray uncertainty with elements of frumpiness and doggedness.",Fresh
"This recipe can serve an entire Odeon at one sitting and, astonishingly and depressingly, will probably even make money at the box office, even though the best accompaniments are boredom and ennui.",Rotten
"The Rebound is a little deeper than your average rom-com, but only a little.",Rotten
"Nothing more than an elongated soap opera, sans the self-awareness.",Rotten
"I understand Amer is supposed to be going through some sort of spiritual crisis here, but Caland plays him as so self-centered and precious that it's impossible to feel any sympathy for him.",Rotten
"Thank God Whitaker is here to bring a bit of real pathos and ambiguity to his role as the spiritual guide who's gained wisdom through adversity, because without his Oscar-winning chops, this exercise in pop mysticism would have been too painful to bear.",Rotten
"After a bumpy start, Ripple Effect begins to show why Whitaker, Virginia Madsen and Minnie Driver signed on as executive producers and co-stars.",Fresh
Several ordinarily banal movies soldered into one amazingly bad one.,Rotten
Starts with a not-very-original insight and takes too many shortcuts delivering it.,Rotten
"Kudos to writer/director/co-star Philippe Caland for crafting such a refreshingly unpredictable cautionary tale and for coaxing inspired performances from an A-list cast which inludes by Forest Whitaker, Virginia Madsen and Minnie Driver.",Fresh
"Ultimately it feels like Poppe wanted to say something about a great many topics...But what he concludes on any one of these points is never clear, so the film simply meanders...",Rotten
"A compelling, if well worn , topic - work/life balance - is brought vividly to life by a great Binoche performance.",Fresh
"The film survives mostly off the wonderful, absorbing leading performance by Binoche, in what a truly layered character to get your head around.",Fresh
"It's as handsomely shot as any film about an ace shutterbug ought to be, and Juliette Binoche infuses familiar internal crises with palpable pain and urgency.",Fresh
I found something questionable in its forced and unearned emotional moments and the frankly rather insufferable performance from Juliette Binoche in the lead role.,Rotten
A trick missed.,Rotten
"Every theme and thesis is italicised. We aren't trusted to probe them with our own minds. The preaching is accompanied, for extra emphasis, by treacly sacerdotal music.",Rotten
"The film has limitations. But it has Binoche, and that's almost enough.",Fresh
"This is a well-observed drama, which acknowledges the war photographer's selfishness as well as her courage and single-mindedness.",Fresh
"A drama of conscience and passion, a finely observed portrait of a woman driven to make a difference in the world, even as it hurts those she loves.",Fresh
When an actor is as good as Juliette Binoche they can elevate an entire film.,Fresh
"Cleverly, the film makes it clear that Binoche is also strongly motivated by bringing suffering and injustice to light, making the central conflict that bit sharper.",Fresh
"Binoche is marvellous throughout, and gets strong support - even if kitten-loving Lisa, in straining to be cute, is merely irritating.",Fresh
"Too prickly for mainstream crowds and rather emotionally sentimental for arthouse fans, this drama may have trouble finding an audience.",Fresh
"A hyperbolic melodrama which oversimplifies its issues, and features too many scenes of Binoche weeping against picturesque Irish landscapes.",Rotten
"Although the ideas and performances are strong, the drama itself feels oddly disjointed ...",Fresh
"Much of the domestic emotion feels contrived. Not the acting, that's mostly very good, it's the mechanisms constructed to portray emotion that falters.",Rotten
"An affecting drama made more poignant by honest-feeling autobiographical elements, Erik Poppe's A Thousand Times Goodnight examines the choice between family and career when that career represents work of real social importance.",Fresh
"Deftly sidestepping both melodrama and family-values messaging, Poppe imbues the film with enormous emotional resonance, brilliantly grounded by his leading lady.",Fresh
"Poppe's closeness to the material ensures a level of passion, but he still fails to create a truly specific dynamic for Rebecca and Marcus's family ...",Rotten
It's difficult to swallow the premise of yet another tale of a heroic white Westerner with good intentions trying to give hope to Middle-Eastern misery.,Rotten
"When Poppe is filming the things he cares about-war, domestic battles, or even the planes of Juliette Binoche's face-1,000 Times Good Night is exquisite.",Fresh
A self-important art-house film by an ex- war photographer who lacks distance from his subject.,Rotten
"Director Erik Poppe's film features cinematography that is artsy without being alienating, but the same cannot be said for his protagonist.",Fresh
Poppe crafts some powerful scenes that pose questions not easily answered.,Fresh
"What makes ""1,000 Times Good Night"" more than a dramatic essay on wartime journalism is Ms. Binoche's wrenchingly honest portrayal ...",Fresh
"1,000 Times Good Night moves too easily from compelling to contrived, but ultimately works due to a commanding performance from Juliette Binoche.",Fresh
"""1,000 Times Good Night"" has moments of both startling violence and breathtaking beauty.",Fresh
"Sadly, this gorgeous-looking adult movie plays out the same theme over and over, never going anywhere surprising.",Rotten
"""1,000 Times Good Night"" takes its time, letting the pathos fully soak in. Those who are regulars at film festivals will find the pacing - and the emotional note it ends on - very familiar.",Fresh
"A disappointingly standard-issue addiction melodrama, this one the tearful case study of an adrenaline junkie whose compulsion threatens to push her family and loved ones away.",Rotten
"Poppe's intimate story feels contrived. Autobiographical films have a tendency to come off that way, likely because the director lacks distance and takes plot and character development for granted.",Rotten
Poppe can't match the stunning opener of Binoche photographing a suicide bomber in Kabul with scenes of domesticity. But Binoche never falters. She's the film's fire and grieving heart.,Fresh
Binoche and most of the cast keep the drama worthy of our attention.,Fresh
A sensitive drama about the challenges idealists and people of great passion face within the family circle.,Fresh
"Binoche is her usual dependable self, bringing passion and fury to a familiar, but still compelling, character. And director Karl Poppe, himself a former photojournalist and cinematographer, captures the various locales with visual panache.",Fresh
"Despite a screenplay that lets her down for the most part, Binoche is wonderful as Rebecca, a woman divided by her passion for the job and maternal instincts.",Fresh
"The whole cast is good, but as always, all roads lead to Binoche, who is wonderful.",Fresh
Moving story about mother/war photograher has mature themes.,Fresh
"As one would expect with of a film made by a photographer, 1,000 Times Good Night is always visually interesting.",Fresh
"This potent Norwegian drama by Erik Poppe, himself a veteran war photographer, opens with a gripping sequence.",Fresh
"In a heart-wrenching performance, Juliette Binoche haunts as a war-photographer whose camera acts as her moral compass but blinds her to her family's needs",Fresh
"It's a rich, fascinating and provocative film that never takes sides or opts for easy answers.",Fresh
"Poppe registers Rebecca's moral commitment as well as the compulsive aspect of her dedication but the film oscillates between drama and statement; it becomes a series of set-pieces and what-ifs, particularly towards the end.",Fresh
I wanted it to be more than it was.,Fresh
When we see photos or film footage taken at great risk on the front line we rarely stop to think of the price paid by the photographer; this film rectifies that.,Fresh
"Anger and anguish visible in her eyes and etched in the lines of her face, Juliette Binoche delivers a terrific performance.",Fresh
"Binoche is impressive, bringing a steely, self-contained detachment to even the most intimate moments with her family. But Erik Poppe, the director, slathers the film in overly sentimental music choices",Rotten
"Alas, following on from such a striking and tense opening was always going to be difficult. The focus swiftly shifts to an account of disturbed domesticity, and so does the A Thousand Times Good Night's effectiveness and interest.",Rotten
"If I'm complaining about this movie a lot for one I'm deeming better than fair, it's because I was frustrated by how its first-rate ingredients, Binoche chief among them, somehow failed to create a spectacular end result.",Fresh
"Shot with a gorgeous eye, the filmmakers aren't afraid of lens flare or overexposure to add an ethereal beauty to horrific circumstances of which we're bracing for impact.",Fresh
The geopolitical realities of 2015 entitle us to expect something more nuanced than this.,Rotten
"Despite Binoche's mighty efforts, 1,000 Times Good Night never recovers from its self-congratulatory ambitions and mechanical plotting. It's the movie that winds up shell-shocked.",Rotten
"... although at times the story seemed unsurprising, the end really packs a punch. There are lots of layers to unfold here, both personal and political.",Fresh
"As for Binoche, her performance as Rebecca is a standout even in a year that included winning turns in films from Fred Schepisi and Olivier Assayas.",Fresh
"The low-budget high-school comedy is no 'Ferris Bueller's Day Off' but should provide for not only laughs but some insight into the life of a smart, 13-year-old outsider.",Fresh
"Abigail's older brother Spencer Breslin, does his own magnificent Little Mister Sunshine leading boy thing. Harold, a kinder, gentler Superbad - the talking dirty teen motormouths. Move over, Judd Apatow.",Fresh
The presence of Cuba Gooding Jr. in this odd little indie comedy should set off early alarm bells.,Rotten
An outsider adolescent sinks in a sea of troubles in this wobbly comedy.,Rotten
"The long stretches of dead air that, it can only be assumed, were supposed to be filled by laughter provide ample time for pondering what audience Harold, T. Sean Shannon's strenuously stale comedy, was intended to find.",Rotten
Harold is a genuine oddity that's more watchable than it sounds.,Rotten
"Shot and lit like a mediocre TV show, the sporadically amusing Harold is a true Blockbuster contender, that is for the bargain bins of the video store. And soon.",Rotten
"There's little indication, beyond the endlessly unfunny school humiliations and fogey-dom signposts (ha ha, he uses Old Spice), that the notion of a preteen codger is worth our sympathies.",Rotten
Breslin is the best thing about this myopic comedy that doesn't even get any humorous traction from the stereotypes it presses through its low-fidelity independent film filter.,Fresh
"Harold is the type of one-note dead zone ideally suited for a bathroom break while sitting home on a Saturday night, alone and semidrunk, in front of the television.",Rotten
"Has a wan sweetness to it which helps it through its more forced and obvious patches, of which there are many.",Rotten
A terminally lame puberty comedy about a prematurely bald 13-year-old.,Rotten
"While the script never gels into anything worthy of the peculiar premise, Harold is still worth seeing for Breslin's marvelously weird performance.",Fresh
"confidently struts along, seemingly unaware of its lackluster script and distinct lack of professionalism.",Rotten
"Director Paul McGuigan and screenwriter David Boula are content to rely on the usual suspects, taking their visual and dramatic cues from other, more clever and involving sci-fi capers.",Rotten
Engagingly photographed but dramatically inert.,Rotten
A confused jumble of parts in search of a whole.,Rotten
"A harrowing mindbender which successfully blends elements of X-Men, The Matrix and Memento while adding some of its own unique sci-fi flava.",Fresh
It's an ambitious attempt to shove the whole of a fairly complex comic book universe into a single messy and garish movie.,Rotten
"A weightless, style-driven thriller set in a photogenically chaotic Hong Kong.",Rotten
The film is blessed with a frenetic pace that simultaneously accomplishes two things: it keeps the energy level high while obfuscating some of the most obvious logical flaws in the plot's structure.,Fresh
A clutter of worn genre elements stitched together with superficial stylistics.,Rotten
"Push is supremely elegant, even beautiful; you can get lost in the visuals even as the narrative implodes. If ever there were a triumph of style over substance, this is it.",Fresh
"The scenes focused on lukewarm dialogue outnumber the action scenes ten to one, giving the film a listless, low-energy vibe.",Rotten
"Even with all its idiosyncratic elements, Push feels like something we've seen before. Unfortunately, said memory is of something far more fascinating and definitely more engaging.",Rotten
"Push falters not in trying to add its voice to the genre, it falters in not having anything compelling to say.",Rotten
Movies don't get more headache-inducing than Push.,Rotten
"The ending left me scratching my head, unsure of what had happened, but certain of one thing: The giant pile of loose ends means somebody intends to make a sequel.",Rotten
"A trippy, nonstop action fest, with the feel of a really good episode of Heroes.",Fresh
"Eventually buckling beneath the girth of its own mythology, Push ends with less a cliffhanger than really just a cliff.",Rotten
It's the perfect brain vacation for those overtaxed by Oscar-nominated movies.,Fresh
"An ambling, broody concoction along the lines of Strange Days.",Fresh
Not much of it makes sense. The rest isn't terribly interesting.,Rotten
... delivers the requisite spectacle... but skimps on character and story.,Rotten
"Push is NBC's Heroes, if anything ever happened on Heroes besides oh so mysterious prophecies and a litany of excuses to avoid action sequences.",Fresh
A great premise is marred by disastrous execution in this disappointingly un-heroic take on the comic-book genre.,Rotten
...a fun thriller that has a couple of tricks up it's sleeve.,Fresh
Imagine if the X-Men had spent most of their time sitting around talking about how they were going to fight Magneto instead of ever actually doing anything and you'll have a good sense of what is wrong with Push.,Rotten
"An unholy mixture of Heroes and Jumper...'What if nothing we did made any sense?' says the inept hero, apparently reciting the credo of the moviemakers.",Rotten
"Push barely measures up to even the worst moments on ""Heroes,"" and it makes 20th Century Fox's weaker superhero efforts look much better.",Rotten
...your understanding of just what is happening will correspond to the amount of time you spend watching the Sci-Fi channel and TV shows such as Heroes.,Rotten
It would take some pretty powerful mind control to convince audiences that Push is a winner.,Rotten
"I thought Hayden Christensen in last year's Jumper would be as bland a mutant as the screen would ever give us, but that was before I saw Chris Evans in Push.",Rotten
"In plot, it meanders. In character development, it implodes. In action, it plods. In effect, it numbs, but, alas, not quickly enough.",Rotten
"Push has amazing special effects and production design, but that doesn't compensate for the messy, incoherent plot and lack of truly palpable Sci-fi thrills and excitement.",Rotten
"Belle... is blank as a page, and the intended romantic chemistry between her and Evans is never in evidence.",Rotten
"Push has vibrant cinematography and decent acting, but I'm blasted if I know what it's about.",Rotten
"Push has an interesting premise, but it just doesn't manage to translate it into a great movie.",Rotten
A better-than-average sci-fi thriller with genuine jolts and unexpected texture.,Fresh
One of the better recent attempts at cashing in on the superhero film craze without having an actual comic book to adapt.,Fresh
Pure escapist fun.,Fresh
The best thing about the movie is that you can never predict exactly where it's going.,Fresh
Sci-fi thriller has more style than story; some iffy stuff.,Fresh
"There are many problems with Push, and most are the usual boring things: unnecessary plot loops; long, dumb musical interludes; a charmless script; and ostentatious action sequences in which the only person excited is the cameraman.",Rotten
"When Push comes to shove, don't expect to care about any of it.",Rotten
A silly movie that is partially engrossing and plenty convoluted.,Rotten
"Evans and 10,000 BC's Belle shuffle through a turgid romantic subplot, and though the two characters are very, very pretty, they've got the chemical spark of a banana.",Rotten
A grubby cut-price sci-fi thriller.,Rotten
"Just as it's getting impossible to tell the superpowered humans without a scorecard, along comes Push to muddy the waters.",Rotten
"By the time the credits roll, your most fervent wish is to run into a 'wiper' (one who can erase memories).",Rotten
A bargain basement melding of clich√©s from the X-Men franchise and TV's Heroes.,Rotten
You know a sci-fi script is in trouble when it spends the first five minutes narratively briefing you on its Byzantine plot -- and you're still not sure what's going on.,Rotten
"Suggestive of X-Men, The Matrix and the television show Heroes, Push is one of those time-mangling thrillers that manages to seem both complicated and superficial.",Rotten
"One long mistake from start to finish, this is a film that never gets its rhythms or bearing right.",Rotten
It's like watching an X-Men movie that doesn't feature the leather costumes and which doesn't have enough in the way of requisite thrills or action to keep anyone interested in it for very long.,Rotten
"It goes nowhere new and offers nothing we haven't seen before, and while it's nice the filmmakers put so much stock in building their characters three-dimensionally the fact they give them all nothing of interest or merit to do kind of defeats the purpose",Rotten
It does the job it sets out to do: providing engaging entertainment centered around an interesting idea that it respects enough to think through properly.,Fresh
Parental Content Review,Rotten
"Too much explanation, of the sort Cassie is inclined to provide, only slows down the nonsense Push is pushing.",Rotten
"With mediocre expectations going in, the flick's cleverness, great score and wicked fight scenes lead me to recommend this to anyone looking for a good time.",Fresh
"As a whole, Push feels unfinished, its ultimate destination accounting for nothing more than a shrug. There is a fair amount to like here, and just as much to resent for how much better it could have been.",Rotten
"You have to be clairvoyant to follow the particulars of this overly complicated, unconvincing thriller about folks with paranormal abilities.",Rotten
[D]isappointingly generic shoot-'em-up dressed up with a few paranormal frills...,Rotten
"As far as I can tell, the only ability in short supply is acting.",Rotten
What really struck me more than the plot itself was McGuigan's amazing use of location and space; it feels as if this movie and these characters are really living in Hong Kong.,Fresh
"It's not great, but it's a perfectly fine version of psychics on the run versus the bad guys.",Fresh
"Absolutely derivative, but nonetheless of interest.",Fresh
"'Push' suffers from a baffling script, but Dakota Fanning delivers a very watchable performance in this sci-fi thriller.",Rotten
Push is this year's Jumper. 'Nuff said.,Rotten
"Long on style, short on substance and logic, it's baffling and frenetic, defeated by its own chaotic cleverness.",Rotten
It's the kind of film you wish had no sound - perhaps the studio should have eliminated the dialogue and replaced it cue cards every few minutes like the silent films of old.,Rotten
"Except for the cast, 'Push' reminds me a little bit of last year's 'Jumper.'",Rotten
"This is the kind of film where nothing makes sense, it's one huge plot hole. And if that wasn't negative enough, it's witless, boring, shallow and too talky.",Rotten
"If you want to see a movie about mutants with superpowers, watch any of the X-Men movies or the ""Hellboy"" movies or ""Wanted,"" any of those six movies is far superior to this.",Rotten
"This would be sci-fi action-thriller feels like a failed television pilot... or better yet, a demo version for something that could be much better with a lot more production value and polish.",Rotten
"Movers, pushers, shadowers - whatever! The script was insane and the characters were inane.",Rotten
"Oh, to have my brain wiped of Push. The smell of desperation on the part of filmmakers to create their own superhero franchise is rancid.",Rotten
"Great ideas, rotten execution.",Rotten
... a rather bland and hard-to-follow knock off of the trendy Heroes/X-Men template.,Rotten
"A kick-ass soundtrack, sexy imagery, and the ghost of a narrative to string it all together.",Rotten
"Silliness rules the day: plot holes abound and are plugged with techno-pounding action sequences and more nonsensical guff. As a TV pilot, this might have worked; as a film, it's loud, confusing and inane.",Rotten
"Though ostensibly action sci-fi, McGuigan's film pushes the boundaries of genre, playing out its paranormal parameters like a game of multi-dimensional chess.",Fresh
"""What if nothing we did made any sense. Would that throw them off the scent?"" Nick asks. You bet.",Rotten
At no point do you care if these dough-eyed buffoons live or die.,Rotten
"The lack of any convincing over-arching plot, the muddled use of alternating futures and squashed-together gaggle of wafer-thin characters renders the project a near complete failure when it comes to thrills and entertainment.",Rotten
"British director McGuigan clearly hoped to make more than a dopey, effects-laden actioner. Unfortunately, he's made an uneven and pretentious one instead.",Rotten
"If the words ""A bit like Jumper but not as good"" strike fear into your heart then you might want to avoid this turgid superpower stinker.",Rotten
"Sloppily conceived but directed with flair, Push is bound to split the vote. Look closely and its disparate pieces fit clumsily together; step back and the overall effect has an undeniable allure.",Fresh
Stylishly silly but oddly cool all the same.,Fresh
"Going to see this film doesn't make much sense. It's obviously been cynically conceived as a franchise starter, but abruptly flicking to the end credits seemingly mid-movie is not a good way to start one.",Rotten
"This obviously Heroes-inspired cash-in promises much but delivers very little, thanks to a confusing plot, uninspired direction, poor dialogue and a curiously lacklustre performance from the normally reliable Evans.",Rotten
"A movie so bland, it might as well have been filmed in Hounslow.",Rotten
"Director Paul McGuigan does his best, but this is just a slog that mistakes earnest detail for engaging narrative. Shove.",Rotten
Why would a psychic 'tec need to sniff a toothbrush to locate its user? Does spearmint freshness have a spooky vibe?,Rotten
"Kinetic and convincing, this uses a limited budget to thrilling effect, giving us a sort of X-Men-meets-Trainspotting twist. We hope a sequel follows this early promise.",Fresh
"In time this would-be thriller comes to rest with a fist fight, a hanging ending and the implicit promise of a sequel. Of all the calamities that Fanning predicts, Push 2 is one she missed.",Rotten
It's fun teen stuff but wrecked by director Paul McGuigan's confusing use of constant flashbacks.,Rotten
Sci-fi hokum to give you a headache.,Rotten
No amount of local colour and effects-heavy fisticuffs can save Paul McGuigan's film.,Rotten
"What it lacks in out and out originality it makes up for with some pulsating action, vibrant cinematography and good performances from a decent cast.",Fresh
"an overheated stewpot of divisions, sects and subsects of extra-special, special and quasi-special mentalists, all running around like their pants are on fire ... maybe in search of a viable plot?",Rotten
Falls into the clumsy trap of being the presumptive first installment of a franchise.,Rotten
Makes viewers feel as if they're watching a movie from inside a spinning clothes dryer.,Rotten
"The violence is incessant, the portentousness constant, the opacity rarely penetrated.",Rotten
"Totally watchable, totally forgettable.",Rotten
Director Paul McGuigan serves this up with a flashy swagger but there is no disguising the fact that it is an incomprehensible mess.,Rotten
"A dull trudge, the sort of popcorn movie that gets released in February rather than during the summer holidays.",Rotten
"Between the unwieldy load of back story and the painfully underdeveloped characters, this infelicitous combination of Jumper, X-Men and TV's Heroes manages to be dull and exhausting at the same time.",Rotten
...suffers from an uneven sensibility that essentially holds the viewer at arm's length virtually from start to finish.,Rotten
A sci-fi thriller with a lot of science fiction and zero thrills.,Rotten
Dashes from genre to genre in search of a reason to exist.,Rotten
A movie I enjoyed watching with a huge smile on my face and will assuredly endure scorn for liking...,Fresh
"The film is likable, but not lovable. All of the pushing can't compete with other sci-fi thrillers. Still, it's worth the ride if you keep an open mind for the unrealistic.",Rotten
A pleasant time-waster with non-abysmal performances and a few interesting concepts.,Rotten
This entry in the superhero sweepstakes isn't without charm,Fresh
"I was at first intrigued, and then bemused and confused.",Fresh
"Pushing ideas into other people's minds is what this sci-fi fantasy thriller is all about, and Paul McGuigan's film looks great. The cast is good too. But there's a problem. The story doesn't make sense",Fresh
The most amazing thing about this by this idiotic sci-fi thriller is that the actors do not crack up when delivering their lines.,Rotten
"The premise is promising all right, but it's a movie over-stuffed with talk and actors with a glazed look as though they too aren't sure of what they're doing.",Rotten
"There isn't a single word in the English language that could justly convey the sheer stupidity, and impenetrable complexity, of Push.",Rotten
Push is a chase film dolled up with supernatural powers and chintzy retro design motifs.,Rotten
"McGuigan's saving grace is a willingness to slow down and savour his own images. At best, a moody inconsequence takes over and confusion feels like part of the plan.",Fresh
"Light fixtures are the true stars in ""Push,"" constantly reflecting, twinkling and popping. Its best moments are when guns levitate and fire themselves. When you don't even need actors to hold pistols, it's the ultimate in autopilot filmmaking.",Rotten
"Set and filmed on location in bustling Hong Kong, the tight urban street and winding alleyways suit the film perfectly, but this is not enough to save Push from the Oscar season garbage dump.",Rotten
Push is an empty calorie extravaganza and demands a crooked concentration it doesn't earn to sufficiently piece this mess together.,Rotten
jThe script has no deep meaning and the film does just what it was intended to do: take an audience on a fantastical journey with loads of action.,Fresh
"Ambitious, but alarmingly confusing thriller set in Hong Kong.",Rotten
Felon flounders in convincingly resolving its protagonist's plight.,Rotten
Former stuntman Rick Waugh turns writer/director to make a compelling and gritty drama that is as much a commentary on America's failed justice/prison system as it is about the devastation suffered by an honest family man imprisoned for killing a burglar,Fresh
"The stuff that happens in a tense, taut new movie called Felon is nothing less than electrifying.",Fresh
Felon gives everyone their tidy and expected due but outlines a realistic enough cycle of how a man's life can easily spiral out of his control.,Fresh
"While the film is violent and decidedly tragic, the overall sensation of watching it is nothing you haven't experienced before with numerous films, from Death Warrant to Lock Up to Oz.",Rotten
"Directed with pounding energy by Ric Roman Waugh and acted to the hilt by a cast comprising several of yesterday's stars proving their mettle, the movie delivers the thrills and emotion that prison movies require.",Fresh
Felon ventures outside the prison walls so often that the audience doesn(TM)t get a prolonged sense of the claustrophobia of confinement; the rage being displayed actually dispels the sense of isolation and boredom.,Rotten
"Kilmer and Dorff, who was also an executive producer, immerse themselves in difficult roles and the film's overall air of social commitment will surprise viewers drawn in by its exploitation-movie promotion.",Fresh
"Tough, brutish prison drama with an easy windup, but good acting and an uncompromising take on the prison system.",Fresh
"Written and directed by Ric Roman Waugh, and filmed at the New Mexico State Penitentiary near Santa Fe, Felon is one of the most realistic prison films ever made.",Rotten
"A good cast and disciplined direction add some distinction to Ric Roman Waugh's Felon, which is basically the old tale about an innocent man corrupted by a stay in prison.",Rotten
A subplot involving corrupt guards makes the movie even duller than the score that sounds like a rusty squeezebox.,Rotten
"For a film that seems to pride itself on its depiction of prison-reality, it feels extremely movie-phony.",Rotten
"Stephen Dorff's powerhouse perf as an ordinary Joe trapped behind bars with warring ethnic psychopaths propels ""Felon"" well ahead of its expose/exploitation brethren while still avoiding the pious learning curves of Frank Darabont's prestige prison dramas",Fresh
"This tough, uncompromising, cautionary thriller should be a wake-up call about America's outrageously archaic laws insofar as defending the sanctity of home and family.",Fresh
"Dorff, who was last spotted as a scary sexual sadist in Shadowboxer, gives a mesmerizing performance evolving from stunned civilian to brutalized inmate and dangerous prison thug, then transforming into a tested man who rediscovers his own humanity.",Fresh
"...establishes itself as a gritty, thoroughly compelling prison drama that rarely relies on the various tropes of the genre.",Fresh
"It's still white-knuckle tense, and held together by dozens of small, well-observed moments.",Fresh
"The plot expands and gets more complex as the story progresses, and the dramatic tension ratchets up",Fresh
"Explores how violence is endemic in the prisoner, no matter their background, almost as soon as their sentencing is handed down.",Fresh
"An emotionally intense and powerfully strong film that assails one's sensibilities and mores, ... FELON touches our hearts and our minds, humanizing what and who many perceive as inhuman.",Fresh
"Scar is a generic slasher; even it seems jaded with the 'torture porn' bandwagon onto which it leaps, ultimately feeling like WAZ for dummies.",Rotten
Blood cascades out of the screen (Titanic - in red) when blades are not in your face. Desensitisation soon sets in: too like Halloween H20.,Rotten
"The perspecto-effects are a real letdown, while the pacing and performances are as flat as roadkill.",Rotten
"To make a 3-D 'torture porn' movie is at best opportunist; to make one with flat, boring torture scenes is unforgivable.",Rotten
"This nasty, witless and hopelessly dated effort is still a landmark release. Think of it like the first dog shot into space, but don't forget it is an absolute dog.",Rotten
"The acting is more wooden than the numerous coffins, the plot a rehash of any crazed serial killer flick you care to mention, with extra torture. It's unremittingly nasty stuff.",Rotten
"Another week, another yucky horror film with a title that sounds like ""Saw"". This one's in 3D.",Rotten
"Despite the killer's slavering way with a scalpel, there's no blood spurting out into your near-vision, just a lot of hopeless acting in your face.",Rotten
"Despite it's technical savvy, this pans out as merely the latest in the dispiriting procession of torture porn movies while the dreary identification of the perp doesn't raise the excitement levels much higher than a half-hearted game of Cluedo.",Rotten
"The result is humourless, implausible and lacks a single original idea. There would be no reason for this film to exist, were it not the first live action feature shot entirely in HD3D.",Rotten
"If you make the mistake of going to see it, I recommend taking a spoon so you can scoop your will to live off the floor at the end. Derivative, dull and with a daft ending, even the 3D's not much cop.",Rotten
This kind of torture porn is beyond bad taste.,Rotten
"This boasts of being ""a first of its kind 3D movie event"", but it's just the same old torture porn tarted up.",Rotten
"Run of the mill, largely predictable slasher movie that unfortunately squanders the 3D gimmick that could have made it interesting.",Rotten
"As one character asks, ""It never stops, does it?"" Well, no. Not as long as people keep paying to see such dreck.",Rotten
I'd read about this one for three years. Then I saw it and forgot it immediately.,Rotten
"The sole high point? 3D tits. The porn industry is going to love this technology, presuming you don't mind wearing stupid dark glasses while masturbating.",Rotten
"The Unborn is one of those movies evidently conceived by digging a Dungeons & Dragons Fiend Folio out of storage to find, resurrect, and rebrand some long-forgotten bugaboo.",Rotten
"Well, there are some effective scares here, and you'll laugh at yourself afterward just for jumping and squealing like a little girl. But other images and pieces of dialogue are just as hilarious -- and that probably wasn't their intention.",Rotten
"Exactly what you'd expect from the combination of its release date, genre, and MPAA rating",Rotten
"After three feature films of discouraging quality, Goyer suits up in a beret and jodhpurs again for The Unborn, which holds the miserable distinction of being the most dreadful film he's fashioned to date.",Rotten
The Unborn is a mishmash of half-formed ideas more asinine and exploitative than frightening. At least the title is accurate; this junk is stillborn all the way.,Rotten
Shouldn't have been brought to term.,Rotten
"Even once the ""scary"" monsters start ramping up their appearances the film is still dead and Goyer's direction feels more like a trippy music video for some Eastern European techno band than anything out of a horror film.",Rotten
has the psychological weight and perversity of a mildly racy episode of Touched by an Angel,Rotten
"If the films released during the traditional January dumping ground are going to be this bad, we should employ the nation's best scientists to rearrange Earth's orbit so the year begins in February.",Rotten
"If the use of Nazi atrocities as a MacGuffin for cheap thrills offends you, The Unborn isn't your movie. If, however, you appreciate the sight of a half-naked beauty being terrorized by potato bugs, look no further.",Rotten
"Though some images are on the terrifying side, this mostly outlandish tale is riddled with homicidal tots, interdenominational exorcists, and attention deficit disorder dybuks who can't make up their mystical minds which body is cool enough to inhabit.",Rotten

An early contender for worst movie of the year.,Rotten

Any intelligence gets lost in an unsatisfying ending that doesn't justify the brain cells lost while getting there.,Rotten

pacing that allows the audience to linger on every failing before being distracted by the subsequent one,Rotten
A ham-fisted attempt at a Semitic version of The Exorcist that is utterly unoriginal and totally devoid of actual frights.,Rotten
The Unborn is so lame that even a scene where Nazi 'doctors' experiment on twin children by poking a needle in their eyeballs is more laughable than horrendous.,Rotten

"The script tries hard to delve into the folklore of a dybbuk, and as it mixes this in with experiments on twins in concentration camps during WW2, the story becomes too convoluted for its own good.",Rotten

The Unborn becomes rapidly tedious even as the body count racks up.,Rotten

Less spine-chilling and more eye-drooping.,Rotten
This supernatural horror is nonsense on toast.,Rotten
"The demonic possession plot thereafter breaks down in a tasteless swamp of Nazi experiments on twins, dogs with inverted heads and an exorcism led by rabbi Gary Oldman. Oy vey! The kosher paranormal: a trend in the offing?",Rotten
Think of every scary-kid horror you've seen - this was how The Unborn was made.,Rotten
"Kabbalah meets The Exorcist in this hotchpotch hokum of vengeful ghosts, killer children, crazy old psychic ladies and supernatural Nazi experimentation.",Rotten
"The screenplay by Goyer himself, who wrote Blade and co-wrote The Dark Knight, this time doesn't limber up.",Rotten
This may dabble in Jewish mysticism and the legacy of the Nazi era but scratch the surface and you discover just another standard scary movie.,Rotten

"After a few initial decent scares, the corny dialogue, poor casting and cringe-worthy acting drag this movie into it's own hell. Utter rubbish.",Rotten
"Cue a creepy toddler, various demonically possessed adults and a Jewish exorcism conducted by Gary Oldman. He's a vastly better actor than the film deserves, but he can't make the script seem even slightly better than it is.",Rotten
This foolish film hitches an easy ride from the Holocaust.,Rotten
"The Unborn isn't the worst horror film you'll see in 2009, but the prospect of a sequel (which the film teases at the finale), is probably the biggest fright in the 88 minutes.",Rotten

"There is a senseless scare every 5-7 minutes. Now, after one or two you start to get the giggles but after the third or fourth false scare you begin to Laugh Out Loud.",Rotten

"I truly, truly recommend watching either of those instead of The Unborn. Or your wall. Just staring at your wall is also an acceptable alternative too.",Rotten
I don't know why I even bothered to watch this.,Rotten
But the film's fundamental flaw is that these solid spooky moments hang on a narrative that's not nearly strong enough to bear their weight.,Rotten

"By far the best elements are the regular flashbacks, which showcase the crazy comic book vibe at its best and have some truly spectacular Charlie's Angels-style moments.",Fresh
Just go watch Death Proof again instead.,Rotten
It's an homage to the exploitation genre that doesn't pay full homage to the exploitation genre.,Rotten
"Jacobson and Gruendemann appear determined to put the grind into grindhouse. And not in a good way. Everything goes on so long, including an excessively protracted catfight, that the viewer will be crying for mercy before the characters do.",Rotten

"American rugby is the setting for this earnest sausage party of macho posturing, bro-dacious life lessons and value-focused sportsmanship that give wayward teens the strength to rise above sinful temptations.",Rotten
"Though director Ryan Little puts together a clean, professional package, at bottom this is a nearly-two-hour scrum of therapeutic direct encounters.",Rotten

There's something disheartening about seeing real-life stories and their inevitable complexities put through the Hollywood sausage machine and transformed into bland parables.,Rotten
"It's definitely possible to make artful message movies -- just consider the filmography of ex-Mormon iconoclast Richard Dutcher -- but Forever Strong is generic faith-and-redemption fare, devoid of nuance.",Rotten

"The movie is well shot and edited, the rugby scenes are enjoyable (if likely puzzling to the uninitiated) and Strong's earnestness excuses at least some of its predictability.",Fresh
"Gives the word ""forgettable"" a bad name.",Rotten
The very Tom Cruise-like Sean Faris makes this respectable portrayal noteworthy considering the gritty sport's irrelevancy to most Americans.,Fresh
This earnest indie production comes across like formulaic fiction while taking cues (and recycling cliches) from the 'inspirational sports drama' playbook.,Rotten
The father-son relationship that bolts this rugby film together provides the textured backdrop for a sports film that engages,Fresh

"Unfortunately, the martial arts action is only half the movie - the rest is badly acted and gory.",Fresh
"A bizarre, often tasteless, but never dull Thai martial arts movie.",Fresh
"The slightly slushy plot is really an excuse to catch your breath between the action sequences, which are fast, loud and crammed with references that only Bruce Lee fans will properly appreciate.",Rotten
"Reminiscent of early Jackie Chan flicks, an action-packed, pick-and-mix of punch-ups include a cheeky tribute to Lee's legendary icehouse scene in The Big Boss, culminating in a spectacular multi-storey jaw-dropper.",Fresh
The director makes sure we know that it all proves how people with special needs can triumph.,Rotten

Enjoyable thriller.,Fresh
Chocolate gives us the first autistic action hero.,Fresh

It boils down to this: Thai girl fighting. Is that enough of a movie for you?,Fresh
Chocolate is risibly sentimental even for a genre not known for its emotional sophistication.,Rotten
"Takes its time to get going, but once the action kicks in, it's mildly engaging with lots of mindless fun, especially for avid fans of martial arts films.",Fresh

"In the history of marital discord in the movies, has there ever been a blander conflict than the one between firefighter Kirk Cameron and his goodly wife Erin Bethea in the dismal Christian-themed melodrama Fireproof?",Rotten
This is a decent attempt to combine faith and storytelling that will certainly register with its target audience.,Fresh
"With the production values of a straight-to-video cheapie and the script of a mediocre soap opera, Fireproof is good for just about one thing: dousing whatever flames might be left in your marriage.",Rotten
"Cameron is genuinely compelling as Caleb, a work-obsessed firefighter on the verge of divorce from his neglected wife.",Fresh
Fireproof isn't merely preaching to the already converted; it's helping to further alienate the unconverted and the skeptical.,Rotten
"You probably can't blame pastors moonlighting as moviemakers for wanting to pack their film with multiple messages, but the conversion subplot feels shoehorned into the more crucial marital doings.",Rotten
"While hardly sophisticated in its approach and certainly not polished in its technical elements, the film does get its heartfelt message across with undeniable sincerity.",Fresh
"Unfortunately, the emphasis on what God wants has a way of overwhelming who Caleb and Catherine are as characters.",Rotten
"Fireproof stops becoming relatable to us all and only to the already, or easily, indoctrinated.",Rotten
"...decently made, with good production values, sincere performances...",Fresh
It's one of the funniest films I've seen all year and that was obviously not the intention. This was made for elderly folk who watch Oprah and Dr. Phil and only see 2 movies a year. Embarrassing.,Rotten

"It irreverently normalizes a topic that has been virtually absent from screens in India (where gay sex is still technically illegal), and does so using contemporary Bollywood's best not-so-secret weapon: star power.",Fresh
The best and funniest Bollywood film I've seen in a very long time.,Fresh
The director is obviously confused. The second half dips badly and he resolves the mess with a senseless copout of a climax.,Rotten

"Playing identical twin brothers who have landed on very different ends of the personality spectrum, Norton gives two bravura comic performances, shoulder-to-shoulder...",Fresh
An identical twins comic crime drama goes seriously wrong.,Rotten
"One Edward Norton performance is often enough reason to see a movie, so it comes as no surprise that the prospect of two -- he plays twins -- is very much the main attraction, and reward, of Leaves of Grass.",Rotten
"...worth checking out if only for Norton's phenomenal, Oscar-worthy turn as the film's diametrically opposed twins.",Fresh
"Writer/director Tim Blake Nelson manages a finely tuned balance that is rare in cinema. Moving from the far reaches of comedy to the nether regions of drama, he never skips a beat or sets the pitch too high.",Fresh
"Meant to blow your mind when not pulling your leg, the film has some surreal surprises in store. Like homicidal potheads, a Jewish menorah wielded as a deadly weapon, and a suspicious swastika scrawled backwards at a bible belt synagogue crime scene.",Fresh
"Heady stuff, but plot feels forced rather than organic.",Fresh
"Tim Blake Nelson's Leaves of Grass is some kind of sweet, wacky masterpiece. It takes all sorts of risks, including a dual role with Edward Norton playing twin brothers, and it pulls them off.",Fresh
"Messy genre jumbling has rhyme and reason in Leaves of Grass, as it speaks directly to the film's portrait of life's unpredictability and uncontrollability.",Rotten
...a thoroughly independently minded movie that plays loose at putting across big ideas.,Fresh
Suddenly abandons all comedic promises and turns into a sadistic action film...a textbook example of a promising movie that takes a wrong turn from which it never recovers.,Rotten
"The movie is a showcase for digital technology and for Norton's virtuosity, but I wish it weren't such a weightless shambles.",Rotten
"Leaves of Grass is part goofy drug comedy, part shocking bloodbath. It's a riot of tones and genres, but unlike that other recent hybrid, Pineapple Express, the parts add up to something larger.",Fresh
"The movie bubbles with intellectual curiosity and narrative ambition. And for that I dig it, even if Leaves of Grass has the habit of swerving and sometimes lurching from tone to tone.",Fresh
"It's just another oblique backfire from Tim Blake Nelson, whose work as a writer-director in general wallows in a bog of mediocrity.",Rotten
"It would be overly polite to call this a pale shadow of the tone-shifting Coen brothers farces from which Nelson -- who costarred in O Brother, Where Art Thou? -- is taking his cues.",Rotten

"It's not the violence itself that bothers me, it's just that it completely destroys the tone of the movie.",Rotten
You could get whiplash from his movie's mood swings.,Rotten
Emerging director Tim Blake Nelson takes another step up with this comedy drama starring Edward Norton in what might go down as Norton's best performance yet.,Fresh

"The mirror image gag is one of the oldest in the book, and yet, if done well, it never really gets old.",Fresh
"As a writer-director, Nelson keeps the laughs coming at a steady pace, and never condescends to his articulate redneck characters.",Fresh
"Mr. Norton is a pleasure to watch, and so is everyone else.",Fresh
"... through it all, the two performances by Edward Norton feel natural, relaxed, utterly unlike a gimmick.",Fresh
"Suffice to say that Blake Nelson doesn't have the visual gifts of his Minnesotan mentors, leaving us undistracted by surface flair and fully focused on his cartoonish characters and ragged, oddly callow script.",Rotten
Many clich√©s in uneven and odd mix of guffaws and philosophical analysis. . .[C]onsiderable violence surprisingly erupts...[M]ost fun is watching Norton interact with Norton.,Rotten
"It's a jarringly realistic hybrid that echoes the more surreal aspects of real, rural life, and Norton walks/ambles through it all, sporting dueling personalities and distinct accents, but one very serious heart.",Fresh
An offbeat thriller that is deepened -- rather than derailed -- by its tricky shift from darkly funny to just plain dark.,Fresh
This is a very personal film from Nelson that is jam packed with ideas and heavily influenced by the Coen Brothers...,Fresh
"The DVD extras give the film a boost with a well done ""making-of"" featurette and a commentary of the film by director Nelson, star Norton and producer William Migliore.",Fresh

"It's doing the same old thing but seems to know it, and so does its best to find something new buried in those clich√©s.",Fresh
Humor and romance are interspersed so predictably it's as if screenwriter Pete Chairelli were working from a rom-com checklist.,Rotten
Director Anne Fletcher keeps the romantic comedy running with a bubbly spirit and a snappy pace.,Fresh
Diverting romantic antic about a sham engagement is sparked by the bright chemistry and comic timing of Sandra Bullock and Ryan Reynolds.,Fresh
A likeable romantic comedy featuring two charismatic leads who can't quite escape the shackles of a predictable storyline.,Rotten
"The Proposal won't catch any bouquets for originality, but in terms of a bended-knee pitch for the affections of women this romantic comedy pretty much pulls out all the stops.",Fresh
"Sandra Shock: Bullock partners well with Ryan Reynolds, their romcom strengths sailing above any of the weaker options put forward by this decent Proposal.",Fresh
"The lure of Reynolds' and Bullock's nude scene together is sure to fill cinema seats (and raise a smile), but the other 106 minutes of The Proposal prove utterly forgettable.",Rotten
"You know every tinny beat and false note by heart, from the implausible setup to the sprint-to-the-airport finish.",Rotten
"With Ms. Bullock playing a lady only a polar bear could warm up to and Ryan Reynolds' exquisite balancing of the dynamics of the situation, this romantic comedy finds a sweet comfort level.",Fresh
An old-fashioned romp reminiscent of the best of Doris Day and Rock Hudson!,Fresh
"this is sort of an object lesson in what's wrong with comedy today. The first 15, maybe 20 minutes of this film was really promising... And then it all falls apart because they bring in all these silly, farcical things.",Rotten

The Proposal works up such a fun vibe that you couldn't care less about the contrived schematics of its story.,Fresh
"The stars aren't going to erase memories of Hepburn and Tracy, or Lombard and Powell, but Bullock and Reynolds - even when playing a naked bathroom scene together - make a good fit.",Fresh
"The Proposal could have been much smarter, and much hipper. Instead, it settles for silliness and sentimentality.",Rotten
"Bullock's longtime fans should be happy to see her fully engaged in a role that suits her and paired, at last, with her comic equal: Reynolds.",Fresh
The chemical energy between Bullock and Reynolds is fresh and irresistible.,Fresh
Classic screwball comedies knew how to get antagonistic lovers to fall for each other without having to resort to bathos; one wants to send first-time screenwriter Pete Chiarelli to an all-day Howard Hawks film festival.,Rotten
So we've got a prodigal son who has the chance to deal with his father issues and discover things about his heretofore evil boss. It's like a romantic-comedy clich√© twofer.,Rotten

Every scene between Bullock and Reynolds only suggests how fine they might be in good circumstances.,Rotten

"Yet another formulaic romantic comedy, with little to offer except sparkling performances from Bullock and Reynolds.",Rotten
"has fleeting moments of hilarity and charisma, but ultimately falls flat as a romance, comedy and drama with an inane, sitcom-ish, uninspired and lazy screenplay along with sloppy editing and direction.",Rotten

"...may not be the worst romantic comedy ever made, but it surely is one of the most unnecessary...plays like a patchwork of everything from ""Men in Trees"" to ""Chuck and Larry.""",Rotten
"The Proposal coasts along on likability, right up to its standard-issue ending; what it doesn't do is surprise us in any way.",Fresh
"Though it falls short of winning our hearts completely, The Proposal is a serviceable and intermittently funny romance made enjoyable by the sparks between Bullock and Reynolds.",Fresh
"And though Bullock and Reynolds have snappy chemistry to spare, their love affair stops just shy of being believable. There are too many awkward 'tender' moments and not enough vigor for a real romance.",Rotten
"Hinging on the far fetched premise that if you put two people with zero chemistry in a room together long enough, they'll inevitably fall in love with each other, the movie is stolen away by Oscar Nunez's multi-tasking paunchy male stripper grocery clerk.",Rotten
Surprisingly charming and smartly executed.,Fresh
"Despite sparkling performances by Ryan Reynolds and Denis O'Hare, this derivative story has been made into too many movies not to be stale.",Rotten
Never underestimate the pleasure of a sparkly screwball comedy - and a fluffy puppy.,Fresh
Why a screenwriter would think hilarity would ensue from this premise is anybody's guess.,Rotten
"Given the plot summary, you have to admit that anything better than 'I took my own life halfway through the screening' is impressive.",Rotten
The problem is not the acting. The problem is what these actors are required to say and do.,Rotten
"At every turn where The Proposal could have seemingly gone in a less obvious direction, it just puts on the blinders and forges ahead with the cliches of this genre.",Rotten
"All this predictable, romantic/screwball comedy really has to do is supply us with a steady supply of laughs. And in that regard, the film succeeds.",Fresh
"Just looking at the poster for The Proposal, a by-the-numbers romantic comedy starring Sandra Bullock and Ryan Reynolds, tells you exactly how it's all gonna go down.",Rotten
A romantic comedy so numbing it feels like Novocaine.,Rotten
"The setup is formula, but Bullock and Reynolds supply surprising fizz and kick.",Fresh
"Bullock and Reynolds play off each other with a real zing and zeal, but the narrative journeys down an avenue so formulaic the viewer's heart shatters at the very realization of it.",Rotten
"Sluggish when it should be scintillating and sappy where it should be sardonic, this romantic comedy winds up more softball than screwball.",Rotten
"Following 27 Dresses, this is the second high-concept, low-impact, wedding-themed comedy in 18 months for choreographer-turned-director Anne Fletcher. It might be time to move on.",Rotten
Were it not for the jangly screwball energy ... The Proposal would be just another desperate attempt to jam as many winning formula elements into one graceless package as possible.,Rotten
"Though there's definitely an audience for the story's increasingly sunny sweetness, the film sparks to life pretty much only when the estimable duo of Bullock and Reynolds bickers.",Rotten
"It's been made according to the chapter in the box-office manual labeled ""summer counter-programming.""",Rotten
"Oh Sandra Bullock, why do you do this to yourself?",Rotten
"The leads are appealing, the material familiar -- it adds a Front Page romantic angle to The Devil Wears Prada, and reworks ideas from Green Card.",Rotten
"Somehow, someone decided this rom-com needed less rom and more com -- a fatal mistake.",Rotten
"The Proposal recycles a plot that was already old when Tracy and Hepburn were trying it out. You see it coming from a great distance away. As it draws closer, you don't duck out of the way, because it is so cheerfully done, you don't mind being hit by it.",Fresh
"A high gloss, studio Romcom with clich√©d jokes and conflicts that are as uncontroversial as they are predictable, The Proposal is rooted in the most classical of conventions and still finds ways to be surprisingly enchanting.",Fresh
"Despite the fact The Proposal is predictable and stuffed with recycled schtick, it's surprisingly enjoyable and completely charming. If it was a baby, you'd want to pinch its little cheek -- it's that cute.",Fresh
Did you ever notice that the best romantic comedies are often the cynical ones?,Rotten
"Regardless of the changes in setting and leading men, this is still Bullock running off the same old battery, and the fatigue is becoming increasingly difficult to cover up.",Rotten
"Even though I was able to figure out the ending just based on my knowledge of romantic comedies, the film still delivered decent laughs and good chemistry.",Fresh
"Bullock and Reynolds play against type well, and their spicy chemistry is contagious. But while the leads are doing their thing, Betty White slips in and steals the movie.",Fresh
"When White and Bullock are on screen together, they click in a way that makes this predictable film shine.",Fresh
It's about a guy who has to be blackmailed into marrying Sandra Bullock? Blackmailed? He'd have to be married to Scarlett Johansson for that to be realistic.,Rotten
"Instead of being about dinosaurs and time warps, it's about gags that were old when dinosaurs ruled the earth.",Rotten
A hollow proposal though Reynolds proves he's got the chops for comedy.,Rotten
"Thanks to casting and chemistry, this is the first great romantic comedy of the summer.",Fresh
Bullock and Reynolds' chemistry propels charming romcom.,Fresh
"It's impossible to guess why Bullock was ever attracted to this insulting role, and the eternally confident Reynolds is miscast as a young, bullied underling.",Rotten
"Shamelessly derivative, contrived and predictable, The Proposal is nonetheless a crowd-pleasing romantic comedy.",Fresh
"A mostly harmless, completely unsurprising romantic comedy.",Rotten
"There are spit-takes and lies; small dogs and mishaps. And, to cap it off, an impassioned dash to the airport. Seriously.",Rotten
Without question this riotously funny flick is the year's best comedy -- at least so far.,Fresh
"The Proposal is just a good old-fashioned romance, one in which people actually bring out the best in one another rather than the worst. How novel is that?",Fresh
"The bar for modern rom-coms remains depressingly low, but The Proposal clears it with ease.",Fresh
"The movie's lazy, formulaic story quickly becomes an excruciating waste of talent.",Rotten
There's nothing surprising here.,Rotten
"The Proposal often lies flat where it should spark, with director Fletcher failing to maximize her talented cast's potential. The timing is off in several scenes, and a would-be outrageous character inspires more eye rolls than laughs.",Rotten
"A romantic comedy doesn't need to be original to be enjoyable, and yet The Proposal still falls way too short of the mark.",Fresh
"It's got spunk and charm and two skillful stars in Bullock and Reynolds, who make it all feel much less generic than it is.",Fresh
"It isn't a film with a lot of big guffaws, but I smiled through most of it.",Fresh
"Like most Hollywood romantic comedies these days, The Proposal is all about bringing a woman to her knees.",Rotten
"Onscreen chemistry is an elusive notion but you know it when you see it, and Sandra Bullock and Ryan Reynolds definitely have it in The Proposal.",Fresh
"A straight-ahead romantic comedy that relies on the considerable charms of its stars, The Proposal feels so comfortable and familiar you might feel like you've seen it before.",Fresh
"Think ""Taming of the Shrew Wears Prada.""",Fresh
The script encases Margaret in rusted defenses from which it can't free her without awkward leaps and cheats.,Rotten

Kudos to Bullock for trying something different.,Fresh
"A cut above, but no more.",Fresh
"Nobody who ever attended a date movie will be surprised by what happens, but The Proposal has low expectations and good vibes in its favour.",Fresh
A spunky comedy about an odd couple and their adventures in love.,Fresh
The Proposal restores Sandra Bullock to comic glory. It's her best role since While You Were Sleeping.,Fresh
"It's the undeniable chemistry %u2013 both romantic and comedic %u2013 shared between Reynolds and Bullock that ultimately carries ""The Proposal"" over its mediocre, formulaic writing and predictable plotting.",Fresh
The Proposal gives some hope that the rom-com can still function.,Fresh
"Anne Fletcher has practically established herself as the anti-feminist, playing more to the hopeless ring chasers out there rather than those who might be insulted at the prospect of independent women needing a man in their lives to complete them.",Rotten
"In the end, nothing can compensate for the fact that Bullock has been so diligent in ridding herself of any trace of niceness that she looks as if she's regretting the whole thing. Boredom doesn't suit her and a romcom without charm just doesn't rate.",Rotten
"Despite its less than original pedigree, The Proposal is a perfect example of a predictable, formulaic script elevated by fine acting and palpable chemistry.",Fresh
The movie is a checklist of bad sitcom plots and generic romcom characters. But it's also funny and charming and cute.,Fresh
"The experience of watching 'The Proposal"" is not unlike attending a performance from a cover band specializing in the songs of Billy Joel--both offer up the prospect of two hours of mind-numbing blandness without a single original element on display.",Rotten
"Know this: There are no original romantic comedies anymore, only original people in them. Sandra Bullock and Ryan Reynolds make The Proposal a lot better than it ought to be.",Rotten
Sandra Bullock is the paragon of a romantic comedy heroine ... So why does she find herself the star power behind so many romcom stinkers?,Rotten
"The ""here comes the bribe"" relationship between these two likable personalities mirrors that of an ice cream cone that starts off freezing cold and then deliciously melts from the sizzling summer heat.",Fresh
It simply doesn't give this screwball premise the workout it deserves.,Rotten
"As one embarrassing scene follows another, The Proposal accumulates so many bad vibes that it becomes grimly compelling.",Rotten
"Just like Up, the first 20 minutes is the best part, and that's about where the comparisons stop. They had the pieces in place for The Proposal but it slowly fell apart.",Rotten
Sloppy and lazy.,Rotten
Believability really goes out the window here.,Rotten

Cookie-cutter characters inhabit a paper-thin plot while being helplessly propelled to a clich√© climax.,Fresh
"By its own modest aims, it's not horrible ...",Rotten
"While the picture occasionally goes out of its way to make Bullock's character a ninny, the actress refuses to let the role manhandle her, and she and the ever-charming Reynolds work well together.",Fresh
"Once you've set your story up as a bedroom farce, resisting the form seems futile. The Proposal meanders toward a tone without arriving at one.",Rotten
Bullock and Reynolds are appealing enough to make viewers care if real love will emerge from the legal ploy.,Fresh
The chemistry between Bullock and Reynolds makes this good movie even better,Fresh
"The Proposal is a delicious revamping of a Doris Day-like vehicle for Bullock (e.g. Pillow Talk). A virginal (or near-virginal), uptight heroine loosens up and finds true love after she discovers the man she has little patience for is her ideal mate.",Fresh
I am going to do something I've never done before. I hope you're all sitting down....ahem. I am actually going to say something nice about a chick flick.,Fresh
"For a woefully unconvincing summertime romantic comedy, it's not without a certain ramshackle, rickety old charm.",Rotten
"A great example of moviemaking on autopilot. The screenplay not only heads for the predicable finish line, it also makes sure to hit all the predictable stops along the way.",Rotten
"The fresh dialogue, gorgeous scenery, and ultimately winsome love story make this one of the most appealing romances to come down the pike in recent years.",Fresh

"The Proposal could have been a terrific screwball comedy, but the end results are well below average.",Rotten
Probably won't do you a permanent injury should you come into contact with it.,Rotten
"It breaks no new ground, is predictable at every turn, and no one will remember a thing about it a week after they see it. All that said, The Proposal is above-average.",Fresh
"The movie, duly enjoyable, joins a long list of Bullock's previous audience pleasing romance-centric films. For fans of Bullock and Ryan Reynolds' spectacular abs only.",Rotten
There is a beacon of light -- Betty White. Ms. Betty could be cast in a revival of 'New Jack City' and you'd believe her in every frame.,Rotten
"The Proposal feels both new and familiar. It's new, in that it doesn't obey a lot of rules of romantic comedies, while not breaking with tradition, and familiar in that it is reminiscent of some of the best romantic comedies without seeming too derivativ",Fresh
"Sometimes, 'The Proposal' is rather engaging.",Rotten
Bullock deserves better material and so do her fans. The moral: Don't accept a role unless you have read the entire script. Perhaps that's a more worthwhile proposal.,Rotten
"Bullock and Reynolds ... end up elevating The Proposal, turning something old into something (almost) new, something borrowed into something cute.",Fresh
They may as well have called this one 'Mis-Matched Sham Wedding Comedy #57513' for all the effort it makes to shake new life out of a tattered genre.,Rotten
"Despite some fine performances and pretty scenery, The Proposal is predictable yet incredible, and devoid of any consistent tone. Better call off that wedding.",Rotten
"Predictable rom-coms can work if the comedy and chemistry are there. Alas, both have gone AWOL. There's a dry and silent desert where the jokes are meant to be.",Rotten
"One minute you're watching a 21st-century remake of His Girl Friday, the next you're having to endure some awful, dumbed-down ""women's picture"". Bullock deserves better.",Rotten
"Sandra Bullock is teamed up with Ryan Reynolds, and each star's face has a waxy immobility that has nothing to do with Botox; the pure awfulness of the script has paralysed their facial muscles.",Rotten
"The more recurrent noise towards the end was me groaning with disappointment, that a movie which had struck gold with its central matchmaking was succeeding so ruthlessly in taking the shine off.",Rotten
"The Proposal is not a marriage made in heaven by any means, but the eventual charm of the leads and a gag-packed second half manage to salvage the movie from inauspicious beginnings.",Fresh
"Ultimately, there is something refreshing about The Proposal's undemanding humour and unabashed feel-good factor.",Fresh
"A pedigree cast, fun premise and punchy dialogue make Bullock's return to romantic comedy look a great catch, and Reynolds is sharper than a diamond solitaire. Pity, then, that its penchant for sentimentality makes it miss congeniality.",Fresh
"The Proposal might not be ground breaking stuff, but it's a delightful and very enjoyable distraction that will lift your spirits.",Fresh
"As a fish-out-of-water comedy, it's so lousy that you keep wishing someone would put the poor fish out of its misery.",Rotten
Ignore the underlying fact that The Proposal is one big clich√© of a movie and relish Bullock's ability to handle slapstick comedy as well as the smart line delivery.,Fresh
"Despite good moments and likable leads, this lacks both heart and humour in a confection that smacks of the over-familiar.",Rotten
So keen to be cute it curdles our stomachs and so anxious to be funny it jellifies our funny bones.,Rotten
Another dagger in the back of romantic comedy.,Rotten
"Despite some jolly, off-the-wall moments the comedy becomes increasingly desperate, relying on those old staples of fruity old relations, poodle-y pets in peril, 1980s pop dance offs and amusing, over-sexed foreigners.",Rotten
"This turns out to be another bad choice for Bullock who, without playing badly, sinks in the general morass.",Rotten
"Enjoyable romcom that succeeds thanks to the chemistry and comic timing of its two leads, but it's also formulaic, completely predictable and nowhere near as funny as it thinks it is.",Fresh
"As brightly enjoyable as this film is, there's no escaping the fact that it's yet another formulaic rom-com.",Rotten
"Dear Hollywood, from this day forward, for better for worse, for richer for poorer, in sickness and in health . . . please stop parping out meritless tripe like this.",Rotten
"For better or for worse, this could be a hot contender for the best romcom of the year. Might not be the most original, but it's certainly the most consistently funny and well played.",Fresh
"It's not The Proposal's predictability that's the main problem, it's the lazy way it doesn't even try to cover up this predictability with witty jokes.",Rotten
Sandra Bullock's performance alone deserves to give the star her first big comedy success since Miss Congeniality.,Fresh
"At the Sandra Bullock Movie Factory, a Hunky Co-Star Assembly Line rivets a new head on a standard male muscular body per SB pic.",Fresh
The sight of Bullock doing a rap dance with granny in the woods is a traumatising experience.,Rotten
This is familiar territory crudely traversed.,Rotten
"It is contrived and predictable, squandering the chemistry between co-stars Sandra Bullock and Ryan Reynolds as it creates lazy escapist entertainment that is forgotten as soon as the end credits have rolled.",Rotten
A mildly enjoyed engagement that simply wasn't meant to last.,Fresh
I was engaged by the fiery chemistry between Bullock and Reynolds.,Fresh
There is something to be said for such a relentlessly by-the-numbers chick flick programmer that is nonetheless a breezily enjoyable sit.,Fresh
"It's obviously formula stuff, and follows that formula so earnestly that at points you'll wince more than swoon (why does every big proclamation of love in the final scenes need to be made in public?).",Rotten
"The Proposal doesn't blaze any new ground, but it doesn't raze any old ground either. It's a solid, old-fashioned romantic comedy that's more interested in the romance than in being silly or raunchy. These days, that's refreshing enough.",Fresh
"Unfortunately, this winning team is stuck in a dumb vehicle.",Rotten
"Bullock is totally at home in this territory, and she remains fun to watch, but I do wish she would get stronger, possibly more original comedic material.",Rotten
"Tailored to fit Sandra Bullock more snugly than the antique wedding gown altered for the star during the final act, the film begins to fall apart at the seams after its focus wanders from its promising screwball premise...",Rotten

"I found myself enjoying The Proposal more than I felt I should, chuckling at the predicaments and feeling the odd unsolicited tear moisten my eyes as if on cue in the third act.",Fresh
"It's quite a testament to Bullock and Reynolds that despite all the implausible frippery, they still make you root for their characters. Mostly they make you root for them to be paired together again in a better movie.",Fresh

There's still something compelling about watching such a talented cast navigate the choppy waters of Aselton's world.,Fresh
"The characters and situations are a little too quirky for their own good. Everyone is skewed off-center and, while that can be charming in small measures, Gigantic overdoses on it.",Rotten
Credit Dano and Deschanel for generating sufficient chemistry to make the movie worthwhile despite the oft-distracting Kabuki dances dominating the backdrop.,Fresh
"The various twilight performances of the veteran players deserve a look, as do the always interesting appearances of Mr. Dano and Ms. Deschanel. Only the sparks are missing this time.",Fresh
It looks like it was made for one-half of Joan Crawford's old soundstage Pepsi-Cola budget and sounds like it was written by chimpanzees.,Rotten
A borderline insufferable trifle that dispenses quirkiness with its every gesture and breath.,Rotten
I don't remember ever wanting to just haul out and punch a movie before Gigantic.,Rotten
"A note to all indie filmmakers (one that will be too late for Matt Aselton, writer (with Adam Nagata) and director of GIGANTIC): quirky is a tone, not a plot.",Rotten
An oddball romantic comedy about the relationship between a nurturing male and a ditzy young woman who doesn't have a clue as to what she really wants.,Fresh
"sinks under the weight of its peculiarities, making a possibly big story feel like no big deal.",Fresh
Any resemblance the film bears to real people and real situations is purely coincidental.,Rotten
Just a bunch of strange character traits strung together for no reason other than quirk.,Rotten
For a film that only flirts with the idea of closure it may be best to just keep an open mind and enjoy the company of some fine actors playing funny characters trying to find the same answers that all of us are.,Fresh
"If there's anything truly celebratory about Gigantic, it's the exposed performances from Dano and Deschanel.",Fresh
"With curdled humor and cardboard characters, this ghastly movie completely misses the mark.",Rotten
"Quirk fans, prepare to be lightly exhilarated.",Fresh
"Seriously? Indie directors are still making painfully twee, self-conscious romances all these years after Sundance birthed so many quirky cliches?",Rotten
"With its off-center dialogue and upscale industrial settings, Gigantic strains to be original. But beneath its indie affectations it is really another contemplation of generational misunderstanding.",Rotten
"There's nothing inside, nothing to connect the film with the emotions of living people.",Rotten
"The protagonist might be so laid-back that he practically disappears, but the picture itself tries much too hard--and stumbles.",Rotten
"Has a few moments of offbeat humor and boasts a charming, tender performance, as usual, by Zooey Deschanel, but it often falls flat as a convoluted comedy, drama, mystery and romance. It has too many poorly developed storylines that simmer together for 98",Rotten
There was just something about this movie that drew me in. Part of it is the borderline surreal method with which the film tells its story.,Fresh
"The script is sharp, well written, and with some strong performances, especially John Goodman.",Fresh
I felt like I was being hit over the head with a quirky club.,Rotten
It's hard to imagine why anyone would build a whole film around Paul Dano -- or that anyone will again after seeing this movie.,Rotten
"On the basis of Gigantic, Matt Aselton can make a fine and original film. This isn't quite it, but it has moments so good, all you wish for is a second draft.",Rotten
"Anyone can go off and just cynically make a bad movie, but to make a picture as inert, incompetent and emotionally fraudulent as Gigantic takes sincere faith that one is, in fact, making something really, really good.",Rotten
"Eventually Gigantic decides to become a heartwarmer, and why not? Any ending -- including nuclear devastation or a 1940s musical number -- would have worked, too.",Rotten
"This quirky and engaging comedy sports smart dialogue, a surreal premise and a stellar cast.",Fresh
"First-time feature director Matt Aselton, who co-wrote the darkly funny, well-observed script with Adam Nagata, has crafted a disarming tale that's one of the better independent films in recent memory.",Fresh
Aselton's reason for making this movie is easy to discern -- he wants to be a filmmaker. But coming up with a reason for watching this movie is more of a challenge.,Rotten
One of those indies that seems to be trying to top the quirkiness quotient of Juno.,Rotten
There's nothing really appealing or funny about these people or the predicaments in which they find themselves.,Rotten
"Gigantic plays like a Sundance movie with half the nouns removed; fetchingly cryptic for a while, it's ultimately just obscure.",Rotten
"It's just not all that interesting to watch two pretty young things go through the muddled rituals of the pas de duh when I can, you know, do it just as poorly myself.",Rotten
"Like committee-created sketches at comedy clubs, where the audience shouts out random, zany ideas, Gigantic is huge on the random. But unlike the comedy club, there is little, if anything, to enjoy.",Rotten
"Aselton seems to have ingested a hundred forgettable indie comedies, regurgitated them, and applied the random title Gigantic to what came up.",Rotten
Happy would be sad if you didn't want to see her story. And you wouldn't like a Manic Pixie Dream Girl when she's angry.,Fresh
"Was there any idea that came to writer-director Matt Aselton while he made ""Gigantic"" that he didn't use? Seriously, that cutting room floor must have beenSPOTLESS.",Rotten

Zooey Deschanel is the most delightful young actress in Hollywood.,Fresh
Gigantic has an idiotic screenplay in which nothing fits together with anything else and in which the two-dimensional characters get knocked down to one dimension as the movie progresses.,Rotten
"...the story of how two emotionally damaged but terribly affected andprivileged underachievers meet, fall in love and presumably somehow form a family.",Rotten
This determinedly nonsensical American indie feels like it was assembled in an off-world quirk factory.,Rotten
"Not quite this year's hip little indie romantic comedy that could, as it clearly aspires to be, but smart-ish and drily funny while overly littered with twitches and tweaks.",Fresh
"'Gigantic' is a film that succeeds by wearing the viewer down, as an infuriatingly coy, self-conscious first act gives way to a sweet and affecting climax.",Fresh
"The kind of mumbling, lank-haired, achingly self-conscious indie rom-com that gives mumbling, lank-haired, achingly self-conscious indie rom-coms a bad name.",Rotten
"It's slyly misogynistic, dramatically inert, and wastes an intriguing boorish cameo from John Goodman.",Rotten
"This film is entirely empty: empty of substance, devoid of plausible characters, and without anything like a satisfying style.",Rotten
"Here the characters drive everything - they're quirky without being annoying, funny without being clownish and odd but realistic. As funny and interesting as it is, however, the film raises more question than it answers.",Fresh
"It's very hard not to get sucked in to the charm of this movie. Dano and Deschanel play their parts to perfection, exuding just the right amount of awkwardness and insecurity to bring the story to life.",Fresh
"Everything that happens slots neatly into the art house template - wacky leads, wackier supporting players, coy alt-rock soundtrack - but director Matt Aselton doesn't know when to stop.",Rotten
"Taking his cue from his leading man's minimalist, self-effacing performance, director and co-writer Matt Aselton has fashioned a wry homage to eccentricity.",Fresh
"Yet there's an echo of Hal Ashby, or even Hal Hartley, in the subversion of easy truisms about relationships, and its primary note - mild anxiety - may make it a cult favourite.",Fresh
"By the end, I was thoroughly alienated by the movie's twee, self-satisfied empty-headedness and rooting for the homeless man to do his worst.",Rotten
"An indie comedy that's been kooked to a crisp. Wearing its quirkiness on its sleeve, the whole thing's just too self-consciously strange to engage.",Rotten
Gigantic tries so hard to be cute and quirky it forgets it should also try to be interesting.,Rotten
Don't hope for anything profound among the smug coolness.,Rotten
"The film obviously got a grant from Cool Aid, the endowment fund targeted at US filmmakers with nothing to say but a million airheaded ways to say it.",Rotten
"It's kooky, it's quirky, it's dippy, it's trippy, it's loopy, it's screwy - it's indie, and boy, it's annoying.",Rotten
"A likable cast brings some charm and humour to Gigantic but it remains an overly mannered, self-conscious effort.",Rotten
"Fluctuating wildly between wry ironic chuckles and a sombre indie romantic drama, this never quite hits the right balance tonally.",Rotten
"Likeable indie romance, thanks to strong performances and some nice ideas, though it's often a little too quirky for its own good and is almost derailed by a spectacularly misguided subplot.",Fresh
"This gentle romance is so wilfully quirky that it will drive some audiences a bit crazy. But if you can connect to the film's warmth and the humanity of its characters, it really gets under the skin.",Fresh
"This is some of the worst writing of the year, from the meaningless title down. Oh yeah, and a tramp keeps showing up to beat up Dano throughout. Not quite sure why, but I applaud the effort.",Rotten
"It fails to either engage or appeal in a big way, a gigantic way even. It also lacks the required dosage of off-beat humour. And when the movie thinks it's funny, it is definitely not.",Rotten
"Precious and pretentious, and oddly absorbing because of it.",Fresh
Quirky is certainly the word for this offbeat comedy.,Fresh
More like 'bloated.',Rotten
Romance and comedy are deftly balanced in an observation of the beautiful but strange,Fresh

... a rousing documentary on the real costs of petrochemical dependence and the practical alternatives within reach.,Fresh
"While Fuel takes persuasive swipes at the influence of oil-based energy companies over domestic and foreign policy, the film is more dazzling as an introduction to all kinds of clean energy alternatives many of us have never heard of.",Fresh
"Fuel's message is clear -- oil is bad; alternative energy is good -- and its goals are simple -- put Big Oil out of business by selling the American public on the virtues of cleaner energy sources, such as wind, solar, ethanol, hemp, and world music.",Rotten
Those outside the bio-church aren't likely to drive (at less than $2 per gallon) to see it at their local theater.,Rotten
"Smartly animated interstitials, memorable archival material and a lively soundtrack round out the fast-paced proceedings.",Fresh
Tickell makes his case in an entertaining and hence all the more effective manner.,Fresh
One of the refreshing traits of this action-nudging documentary is Tickell's willingness to wrestle his own biases.,Fresh
"For a film about energy, it's marvelous that Tickell ultimately gives us all the proverbial power.",Fresh
Another fervent call-to-arms from one side of the aisle.,Rotten
There's not a single (even moderately) dissenting voice in Fuel; you're either on the biodiesel bandwagon or raping the planet.,Rotten
"It's a slickly enjoyable production (if unfocused and bloated), and his bullet-point tips are persuasive; but dude, there are better ways to humanize these issues than crying on camera.",Fresh
"Thanks to an informative, buoyant tone and the director's own restless intelligence, the film preaches to the unconverted with passion, energy and graphics so clear that they would make Al Gore weep all over his PowerPoint.",Fresh
"A peppy, bouncy documentary that is watchable and informative, although Tickell's celebrity name-dropping at times detracts from the serious message.",Fresh
"A good natured cheer-leading session for clean vehicles, ""Fuel"" is several measures short of the intensity it will take to put Hummers where they belong---in museums.",Fresh
"Tickell keeps the film hopping along, far more interested in the positive than a woe-is-us mentality",Fresh
"shows the not-so-shocking connections between the auto industry, the oil industry and the government, prescriptively offering alternatives ...",Rotten
Tonderai makes good use of soulless motorway catering venues - all white strip lighting and hunched zombie drivers - but overkills his tale with a succession of improbabilities.,Rotten
The label slapped on the side of Mark Tonderai's low-budget horror movie has absolutely no bearing on the silly contents.,Rotten
Mark Tonderai's debut makes for a smart calling card but relies on one tension-destroying clich too many and offers too few thrills to satisfy the hardened horror buff.,Fresh
"For all of the convention and familiarity that Hush exhibits in the early going, it does a fine job of throwing a few wrenches into a generally predictable premise.",Fresh
"Hush proves you don't need a Jason, Freddy or Michael to create a nasty little horror showcase.",Fresh
"There's a nice twist or two in Hush and it's reasonably well-made but it feels like a TV movie or, worse, an extended TV episode of an anthology series.",Rotten
Hush becomes a tight little thriller that waves the flag for British horror.,Fresh
One of Garbo's best and most affecting films.,Fresh
"A slick, MGM production with a great cast but without much Tolstoy left.",Fresh
Garbo speaks again in one of her best.,Fresh
Given the full glossy MGM treatment.,Fresh
"In her 23rd film, Garbo's luminous performance, as the audlterous protag of Tolstoy's novel, is way above the mediocre level of the narrative and direction; the film is a remake of Love, in which Garbo starred opposite her then lover John Gilbert.",Fresh
"Garbo, who also starred in the 1927 silent version of the Tolstoy story, is radiant and vulnerable throughout the film, the centre of the emotional storm that engulfs her.",Fresh
"This lavish, MGM production surely excises some of the important details from Leo Tolstoy's novel, but makes up for it with the luminous presence of Greta Garbo and some gorgeous cinematography.",Fresh
"On the whole, Anna Karenina is a picture of merit. It is decorative, well-meaning, and full of neat encounters, and it certainly presents a Garbo in the high summer of her maturity, richer and more mellow than she has ever been before.",Fresh
"It is Greta Garbo's personality which ""makes"" this film, which fills the mould of the neat respectful adaptation with some sense of the greatness in the novel.",Fresh
There seems more of anguish and more of sombre depth in this version than there was in the old silent film (with Garbo and John Gilbert). Garbo acts with a dignity and a bitter passion.,Fresh
"If you still doubt either Hollywood's ability to deal with a masterpiece or Greta Garbo's greatness as an artist, this is the picture to see.",Fresh
"Fine, fine, and super-fine, if the least bit archaic.",Fresh
"With such a brief running time, it's difficult to create a convincing union - both during the moments of bliss and quarreling, which are equally rushed.",Rotten
"Teasingly enjoyable rubbish through the first hour, Orphan becomes genuine trash during its protracted second half.",Rotten
"Director Jaume Collet-Serra, working from a devilishly clever script by David Leslie Johnson, maintains steady suspense while mercifully mixing in some moments of dark humor.",Fresh
"A pretty interesting movie about the crack-up of an American family lies right under the filmmakers' noses, but in their rush to deliver shock and gore they miss every opportunity to make a smart movie.",Rotten
Orphan works because it's a film that knows exactly what it wants to be -- creepy as all get out -- and does everything possible to achieve that goal.,Fresh
It feels too slow and moody for the Halloween crowd and too absurd and silly for more discriminating horror fans.,Rotten
Just because Orphan is relentlessly bad doesn't mean it's not entertaining.,Rotten
"...a persuasive addition to the subgenre of bad-seed-horror films like ""The Omen"" where a creepy little kid wreaks havoc and murder on the lives of ill-equipped adults.",Fresh
"Nerve-shredding creepy kid home invasion alert, and takeout foundling traumas galore. Along with magnanimous curtsies, excessive doting on dad, stalking parental kitchen sex and, well, a tendency to bludgeon living things.",Fresh
"I didn't mind wasting two hours watching the truly ferocious Furhman teach Max how to play Russian roulette and snickering when Kate thinks to Google ""children who kill.""",Fresh
Sets up a series of increasingly queasy taboo points and then proceeds to rocket-cycle over them.,Fresh
"Overlong and overwrought, Orphan stays faithful to every clich of the genre.",Rotten
"Surely writers David Leslie Johnson and Alex Mace deserve their own circle of hell for thinking up the story, which moves with breathtaking cynicism from disturbing to grotesque to perverse to ludicrous.",Rotten
What could be an interesting horror film just turns ... horrible.,Rotten
"Director Jaume Collet-Serra (2005's ""House of Wax"") serves up a hoot of a trashploitation flick that both follows preset patterns and upends them.",Fresh
One of the best entries in the cute-as-a-button-psycho-demon-child-from-hell subgenre.,Fresh
"An unnerving psychological thriller with the atmospheric elegance of classics like Rosemary's Baby, Don't Look Now and Dressed to Kill, masterful in its blends of style and substance, violence and mayhem.",Fresh
"Director Jaume Collet-Serra moves Orphan along efficiently, doling out a 'boo!' shot every few minutes with mechanical professionalism.",Fresh
"If director Jaume Collet-Serra set out to make a parody of horror-film clichs, he succeeded brilliantly.",Rotten
"Fifty years ago viewers were both shocked and riveted by The Bad Seed, and thirty years ago they went for the ride with The Omen, but to make such old-fashioned and trashy horror flick in 2009 is both courageous and bizarre, to say the least.",Rotten
"During a summer with the usual transforming robots and young wizards, this chilly flick is a bit of a break, and there are worse options than letting this Orphan in the door.",Fresh
"The problem with Orphan isn't merely that the film is idiotic--it's that it's also sleazy, formulaic and repellant.",Rotten
"Despite director Jaume Collet-Serra's apt use of running children's laughter for jolt scares, the suspense generated from Esther's early lunatic behavior is of a mild, amusing variety.",Rotten
A thoroughly enjoyable demon-spawn movie in the tradition of The Bad Seed (1956) and The Other (1972).,Fresh
"Here is a shamelessly effective horror film based on the most diabolical of movie malefactors, a child.",Fresh
"Pristine horror fodder had the script maintained some gumption and cheerfully waltzed into a wonderland of sleaze. Instead, it pulls every last punch...a seriously tasteless motion picture, but it's equally as spineless.",Rotten
"House of Wax director Jaume Collet-Serra returns to the horror genre with Orphan, a clumsy thriller that elicits far more laughs than genuine scares. Like too many horror films these days, the movie is so rife with false scares or misleading",Rotten
"Solid lead performances and a moderately engaging premise make Orphan a slightly above-average evil-child movie with an infusion of Electra complex and a good, if half-hearted, narrative twist.",Fresh
I would have laughed if the movie hadn't already sucked my soul from my body,Rotten
"There's a surprise ending, followed by several bonus endings, and we're not giving anything away in noting that the film's titular adoptee has more lives than Chucky.",Rotten
"Clocking in at more than two hours, the movie teeters between psychological horror and violent blood-letting and, as such, probably won't completely satisfy fans in either camp.",Rotten
"While the third-act surprise twist of Orphan must have looked wicked-good on paper, on screen ... not so much.",Rotten
"The scares are often the generic, push-off-the-slide variety and Orphan doesn't add much to the genre except, disturbingly, a fetishistic bent that's creepy in the wrong way.",Rotten
"The stomach-knotting is kept taut throughout, and the acting is first-rate -- none more than Fuhrman, who seems to have the self-awareness and skill to be one of the best child actors around.",Fresh
"Although reasonably, cheesily suspenseful, the movie takes a long time to get going. Its tagline, 'There's something wrong with Esther,' turns out to be a masterpiece of understatement.",Rotten
"It takes too long to get started, it pulls some key punches, its dialogue is deeply uninteresting, it relies way too heavily on endless jump-scares and its finale is pure slasher-flick formula.",Rotten
Scary-kid movies just aren't what they used to be.,Rotten
"The film rests on Furhman's shoulders, and she's up to the task.",Fresh
"As much fun as it is to follow Orphan's improbable developments, there is also a dark undercurrent that lingers with you afterward. It's that troubling theme that takes the movie from good to almost great.",Fresh
"Occasionally sinks into ludicrousness, but has enough suspense, chills and surprises to keep avid horror fans viscerally compelled and ultimately satisfied.",Fresh
"Oh, how I wish it were true that Orphan was a knowing parody, instead of an unwitting one...",Rotten
"The best thing about Orphan, is the way it plays with the genre's overused staples and its sophisticated audience's expectations.",Fresh
Has enough kinky Grand Guignol moments and scenes of sheer terror to make a quick killing at the box office-even though it borrows from just about every other Bad Seed flick Hollywood has ever unleashed.,Fresh
"It's a cut above most spooky-kid movies, with a twist that sets it apart.",Fresh
Orphan contains one of the most terrifying and intense horror endings I have seen in years but the rest of the film was just laughably bad.,Rotten
"While laughter may not be the intended entertainment value, you have to admit Orphan does entertain. Isn't that what really counts?",Fresh
Orphan is one of the weirdest major studio summer movies in a long time. It's the kid at the summer movie school that no one wants to play with because he's more than a little odd. I always liked kids like that.,Fresh
Parental Content Review,Rotten
"This is a poorly directed wannabe horror film that nevertheless contains more laughs than The Proposal, The Ugly Truth, Ghosts of Girlfriends Past and Land of the Lost combined. Is that a compliment? Kind of.",Fresh
"Actors have to eat like the rest of us, but you still have to wonder how Vera Farmiga and Peter Sarsgaard ended up wading through Orphan and not laughing.",Rotten
"It would be nice to think that Orphan brought something new to the genre, but the only thing it adds is more running time.",Rotten
"So sloppy, so lowdown, so shameless and so entertaining, Orphan provides everything you might expect in a psycho-child thriller, but with such excess and exuberance that it still has the power to surprise.",Fresh
"[Orphan] never exploits the dramatic possibilities, despite the efforts of its excellent cast and gorgeous production values.",Rotten
"To really get under your skin, a bad-seed horror movie needs a demon child whose dastardliness sneaks up on you. There's nothing too subtle, however, about Esther.",Rotten
"It just never quite comes together, either as a horror movie or as a goofy campfest.",Rotten
"This is galling, distasteful trash. I hope the children involved in making it are never permitted to watch it.",Rotten
The acting is richer than the story ... but this is a film designed to live or die on its twist. Good luck with that.,Rotten
That's quite a creepy premise for a horror story to live up to. That it does -- and more -- is a testament to the level of intensity in this tale of a troubled couple who adopt a 9-year-old Russian girl.,Fresh
I'm almost offended that I'm not offended.,Rotten
"This Orphan is an atmospheric and occasionally vicious little git and an above-average entry into the ""cuddly hellspawn"" genre, overlong at two-+ hours but nowhere near as excruciatingly overdone as others of its ilk.",Rotten
Scared me. The twist works.,Fresh
A decent horror flick with a great kid villain that is undone when it hits familiar chase movie territory and dead isn't really dead dead end.,Rotten
The inclusion of a twist ending that's flat-out jaw-dropping in its audaciousness virtually justifies the entire movie's existence by itself...,Fresh
It's ... uh ... creepy in that other way.,Rotten
uncomfortable and wrong,Fresh
It's based on the scene that plays out every day in the checkout line at Walmart.,Rotten
"The most committed, downright unpleasant child-from-hell movie imaginable. It makes The Good Son play like Pollyanna.",Fresh
An idiotic anti-adoption movie that skates over thin ice in its silly but vicious story.,Rotten
Don't be afraid. Horror movies about creepy kids can be frightening %u2013 just not in Orphan.,Rotten
"Its many outright depictions of children in jeopardy are scary, but its marital drama is even more unsettling.",Fresh
"It's bloody, you should be warned, but in the end it is worth it.",Fresh
Painfully predictable.,Rotten
"An entertaining addition to the evil child genre, simply for its over-the-top chills and nutty plot",Fresh
filled with over the top gore and unnecessary plot twists better off left unseen. Leave this one at the orphanage.,Rotten
I'll give this much credit to the movie: I absolutely did not see the twist coming. This is because the twist... is unconscionably f-----g stupid,Rotten
"Not too much gore, and just the right amount of terror make this a mind twisting horror movie in the tradition of ""Carrie"" and ""The Omen.""",Fresh
Schlocky but scary with a weird plot twist that may leave you stunned.,Rotten
"Competently directed junk, with a script that abandons logic at every turn and dialogue that even some snarky teenage girls seated behind me could predict out loud.",Rotten
It would be harder to find a more dark and joyless thriller on the market than this one.,Rotten
"As the poster says, 'There's something wrong with Esther.' There certainly is -- she's trapped in this terminally dull and dimwitted movie.",Rotten
I really enjoyed Orphan and enjoyed the fact that the film went to some pretty dark and twisted places.,Fresh
"Balancing well-rendered melodrama with some impressively ballsy genre moves, Orphan is more enjoyable trash than it should be. Call it John and Kate Plus Hate.",Fresh
Distinguished by a loony plot twist and by its sympathetic treatment of characters...,Fresh
"Orphan delivers the goods and then some, but it's the pretense of respectability that overshadows its often silly, superficial but satisfying scares.",Rotten
"I think that, if someone really wanted to adopt (as my dear parents did), it would take more than a single movie to dissuade them.",Fresh
"An exceptional cast, including child actress Isabelle Fuhrman, make Orphan a cut above.",Fresh
"... an angry, bitter and abhorrent display of masochism masquerading around as a legitimate horror film.",Rotten
"It's not a bad idea for a horror movie, that the seeming victims are not innocent and their complicated past weighs on their present.",Rotten
Check the return policy for this Orphan.,Rotten
"Predictable and been-there, seen-that, but entertaining nevertheless at times.",Rotten
"This wickedly entertaining, if slightly over-stretched, variation on the familiar 'evil child' scenario displays an unusually complex grasp of twisted psychology.",Fresh
A creepy premise is undermined by wilfully flashy direction as a fine cast struggle bravely to inject credibility into a tale of vanishing nuns and burning treehouses.,Fresh
"If you're not easily offended or upset, there is much to enjoy in Orphan. Horror films this skilfully made don't come along that often. You probably won't find a better one this year.",Fresh
"Some impressively committed work from Farmiga (even when Googling ""Children who kill"") and a humdinger of a twist make this a rather good bad seed.",Fresh
"Directing with a wink and some style, Jaume Collet-Serra (House of Wax) knows that it's possible to be totally absurd and witty with it -- he has that trash touch.",Fresh
"It's not only the heavily-signposted ""secret"" that's obvious, but every single scene, as square pegs fit joylessly into square holes for the full running time.",Fresh
"Preposterous in all the right ways, Orphan is this week's true guilty pleasure.",Fresh
"Collet-Serra manages to sustain tension throughout, prudently deploying his jumps and jolts and pumping up the grue factor. So while it often prompts hoots of derision, they're often choked off with a vice-tight wince.",Fresh
"There's a lot of slow burn to endure in the first hour, but the payoff is one of the most batshit crazy finales in recent memory.",Fresh
"Okay, so I saw the ending coming a mile off (and no, I'm not going to spoil it for everyone by telling you what happens) but that didn't stop me actually enjoying this guilty pleasure.",Fresh
"Orphan is nasty but enjoyable, and the whole film is so competently crafted and superbly acted, especially by the three central females, that I was gripped and entertained throughout.",Fresh
Orphan is certainly scary enough for the story to haunt you after the film is over.,Fresh
"That director Jaume Collet-Serra made House of Wax, the Paris Hilton remake, does not bode well. But stars Vera Farmiga and Peter Saarsgard, as mum and dad, find a few frail pegs of humanity to hang their characters on.",Fresh
"A squall of improbabilities leads to a laughable late revelation, yet somehow the film keeps a clammy grip.",Rotten
"After a slow-burning start Orphan degenerates into an increasingly grisly, far-fetched affair with a jaw-dropping twist that has you chortling with disbelief.",Rotten
"Scoff-inducing twist aside, this is an uncannily astute and unnerving family psychodrama, over-garnished by final-act splatter.",Fresh
"A welcome addition to the Evil Child sub-genre, thanks to great performances, strong direction, a delightfully over-the-top plot, some impressive gore effects and a terrific twist.",Fresh
"If Esther materialises silently and unexpectedly once at the edge of the camera, she does it a dozen times - but this is merely the film warming up its trash aesthetic before heading onwards to a memorably queasy finale.",Fresh
"Daring and fresh, 'Orphan' is easily one of the best horror movies of 2009.",Fresh
"There's something wrong with Esther says the marketing tagline to this film, which sums up my response to the film itself.",Rotten
"Nicely down horror flick with a great twist near the end. This is one EVIL child. Well-directed, too.",Fresh
"Preventing Orphan from surpassing its ""solid"" status is the predictability of much of its plot. You'll be able to guess Esther's next move well before she makes it, and some of her sinister shenanigans suffer from being too outlandish.",Fresh
Much credit goes to director Jaume Collet-Serra who shows off his skills to much better affect than in his... ridiculous 2005 remake of House Of Wax.,Fresh
"Although slightly overlong, the film sustains the escalating horror and keeps up its sleeve a truly shocking revelation that's carefully prepared for, though not signalled.",Fresh
Lifted above the average by a pretty nifty twist and some unnecessarily good acting.,Fresh
"Sticking closely to the conventions of the Evil Child movie genre, there are few surprises (or even scares) as we saunter towards that absurd ending. Just about worth a punt on DVD.",Rotten
"It has atmosphere and tension, and the performances are far better than usual for this sort of caper.",Fresh
"One of the good things about ORPHAN, which is directed by Jaume Collet-Sera, is that it takes itself quite seriously and manages to bring a surprising level of originality to the potentially familiar material.",Fresh
"Enough jump-out-of-your-seat moments to make this nonetheless trashy, implausible thirller watchable.",Fresh
"Audacious, silly fun.",Fresh
"Strange and nasty Esther is the consummate political player in a deadly game of unhappy families, in this fairly straightforward psychological thriller.",Fresh
"Isabelle Fuhrman as Esther does her best with the material, but frankly the story lacks a strong central thesis about the nature of evil.",Rotten
A pretty good little B-movie thriller.,Fresh
"The movie amps up the tension to a laughable degree, using every clich in the horror movie guidebook.",Rotten
"Director Jaume Collet-Serra (House of Wax) endows this ugly mess with a slew of unintentional laughs, but not enough to repay the 123-minute time suck.",Rotten
"Collet-Serra's film succeeds in being genuinely creepy, is commendably well acted by all concerned, and contains the best twist since The Crying Game.",Fresh
"""A superior entertainment.""",Fresh
a carefully staged deconstruction of our assumptions about horrorshows about preternaturally manipulative and malevolent children,Fresh
"Orphan is as much a high-tension, frightening thriller as it is a straight-up horror flick, at least it is until it devolves into outright silliness in the final act.",Fresh
Something isn't quite working in the intended way when the audience's primary reaction for two-+ (!) hours is raucous laughter.,Rotten
A difficult child that horror-loving parents will find hard to adopt as one of their own.,Rotten
"David Johnson's script plays fair with red herrings before a devilish denouement with all the torque of a good twist. Esther doesn't just want to topple the Colemans' house of cards. She wants to torch it, and ""Orphan"" is gruesome, gripping material.",Fresh
...more concerned with producing cheap thrills and melodramatic effects than creating any sense of mystery or suspense.,Rotten
"For the most part, Esther is an entertaining and solid addition to the Evil Child canon.",Fresh
This is the rare fright flick that is actually grounded in some genuine human emotion.,Fresh
"Orphan is not very good. At 90 minutes, it might have been amazing. At nearly two hours, it's tedious.",Rotten
Bad Seed-style horror movie is gory and ludicrous.,Rotten
"Alas, in the end, it's not nasty enough.",Rotten
"As interesting as Collet-Serra's story is, there's simply nothing here that you won't find in other better evil children films in the library...",Fresh
Decidedly amoral.,Rotten
"The movie is, as these things go, enjoyably trashy.",Fresh
"If we could all stop for a moment and think about how excellent and uplifting garbage can be, America would rally around this movie like the treasure it is.",Fresh
"Weak adult characters and lame ending aside, Orphan succeeds more often than not, mainly thanks to Fuhrman's performance and Collet-Serra's direction. It's not a fantastic thriller but it's not bad and often far better than it probably should be.",Fresh
"If you are a huge fan of the evil kid sub-genre of horror flicks, then this movie is definitely going to be right up your alley.",Fresh
Dump a murderous psycho brat with a corny Russian accent into that troubled mix and you've got a real horror show on your hands. But not a good one.,Rotten
Directed crisply and with a palpable air of mid-'70s paranoia thriller.,Fresh
It does squander a strong setup though with an increasing amount of camp.,Rotten
"The movie looks and sounds pretty, but that's not enough to warrant giving it a shot.",Rotten
"A creepy, yet fun, alternative to a testosterone-filled summer, a small but effective little thriller that features some strong performances and a neat little twist that makes it a cut above most horror films.",Fresh
Orphan is refreshing for its skilled execution and genuinely disturbing atmosphere that permeates every scene.,Fresh
"Aryana Engineer, a real-life deaf actress, is almost equally as hypnotic as Fuhrman without uttering a single word throughout the film.",Fresh
"If you're going to make a weepy, there's no reason you can't make it with intelligence and insight as the makers of My Sister's Keeper have done.",Fresh
An awkwardly structured but warmly emotional and relatively unsentimental drama.,Fresh
"Unsubtle, uneven and undeniably effective.",Fresh
"Cameron Diaz gives a strong dramatic performance in Cassavetes family melodrama, which begins well with poignant probing of timely issues like social engineering before turning into conventional courtroom tale that deviates from the book considerably.",Rotten
"My Sister's Keeper is a shameless weepy, one of the most manipulative and fundamental of genres, but it also raises some surprisingly difficult and thought-provoking ethical questions.",Fresh
"A lot of things don't work that well in My Sister's Keeper, a tearjerker adapted from Jodi Picoult's best-seller. But one thing is guaranteed: The movie practically forces you to shed a tear or two.",Fresh
Like a Lifetime disease-of-the-week movie on steroids...tugs at your heartstrings so relentlessly that by the time it's over you might require a defibrillator.,Rotten
Films that present a moral dilemma and make us consider the unthinkable are as rare as bargain popcorn in the summer. Cassavetes manages that feat and turns this weeper into a keeper.,Fresh
The writing team of Jeremy Leven and director Cassavetes have joined forces with a great cast to bring the best-selling book by Jodi Picoult to life with a purity that can only be called inspirational.,Fresh
"While this little wrencher works, cinematically, perfectly well, the truth is, this one is going to piss off a whole lot of people.",Fresh
Makeup department realism alone can't redeem the dramatic fallacies surrounding it.,Rotten
"Once the bizarre premise is established, all the movie can do is wait for the story to play out -- it has a beginning and end, but no middle.",Rotten
Two straight hours of emotional torture porn that is so brutally assaultive in its determination to jerk tears from viewers that it practically leaps off the screen and into their laps in order to get to them quicker.,Rotten
No quote available.,Rotten
"A motion picture of notable sensitivity and beauty, hamstrung emotions kept to a minimum. Tough, touchy, provocative, and exceptionally moving.",Fresh
How far would you go to save your child's life? How far should you go? Those are the questions posed and largely ducked in this film based on the book by Jodi Picolt.,Fresh
"A moving story, but the film's overly romantic tone rings hollow.",Rotten
Don't avoid My Sister's Keeper because it's a film about a serious issue. Avoid it because it approaches that issue like a very special episode of Grey's Anatomy -- complete with whining pop songs and all the comforts of cliche.,Rotten
A shameless attempt at manipulation that wants but doesn't earn audience tears.,Rotten
"Keeper, striving to manipulate the audience, goes on a little longer than it should. However, the performances are so true that it's easy to forgive such unneeded, straight-to-the-heartstrings tactics.",Fresh
"You may cry at the film's designated crying times, approximately every 10 minutes, like the traffic and weather. Or you may not, and wonder instead why some high-gloss weepies treat their source material quite so shamelessly.",Rotten
"Less an exercise in catharsis than an obstacle course of premise-heavy, flashback-drenched plot points, it's an emotional flat-liner, even though virtually every character (including Alec Baldwin as the lawyer) carries some hurt or grief.",Rotten
"It's beautifully shot and skillfully acted, but My Sister's Keeper, an earnest family-faces-cancer drama, is a bit like a real-world horror film with 'heart,' right down to the trick ending.",Rotten
This ethical drama tries to make people think about medical and family dilemmas while wringing a few tears out of them along the way.,Rotten
A perfect example of a disease-of-the-week movie done wrong.,Rotten
"This book hasn't been adapted, it's been taken outside and shot.",Rotten
"Wailing and screaming and fighting with everyone else onscreen, Cameron Diaz is giving a powerhouse performance her character doesn't warrant.",Rotten
"...a blatant 10 hanky weeper masquerading as something deeper, but it does some things well in spite of itself.",Rotten
My Sister's Keeper suffers from sheer sloppiness of script that results in scenes of comedic frivolity coming off as screechingly forced.,Rotten
"It would take a heart of stone not to be affected by My Sister's Keeper, but the film's unceasing manipulation has a Medusa effect on the organ.",Rotten
"My Sister's Keeper doesn't pull any punches, and it doesn't tell any lies, and it earns every feeling and thought and memory it brings to the audience.",Fresh
"an overly sentimental movie-of-the-week, masquerading as counterprogramming to Michael Bay's box-office-blasting robots.",Rotten
"Unsubtleties be damned, our defenses fall. Meanwhile, Cassavetes' reign as the go-to waterworks man remains uncontested.",Fresh
"It's a family melodrama that never misses the opportunity for a heartbreaking, acoustic musical montage that brims with portent, as if we could forget that losing a child is hard and terrible.",Rotten
"Surrounding and ultimately subsuming this ethical struggle is a fair amount of pediatric-cancer horror and mush, though Cassavetes is frequently bailed out by his cast.",Rotten
"Like an amalgam of every ""ABC After-School Special"" ever made ... makes most Lifetime Channel movies seem competent by comparison.",Rotten
My Sister's Keeper is an immediate audience-grabber.,Fresh
"For every instant of genuine tragic ache within this dubious feature, there are two served up right behind it that drip with obnoxious manipulation and creaky execution.",Rotten
A shamelessly manipulative film that proves insulting rather than moving.,Rotten
"Ttries so hard to check in with everybody (dad, brother, sister, mom, etc.) that it doesn't get close enough to anyone.",Rotten
Could easily have had the disease-of-the-week feel of a TV movie. But Cassavetes isn't afraid to tackle stories in which feelings trump ideas.,Fresh
The infuriating cop-out ending reduces the premise to mush.,Rotten
"A mostly contrived and uneven drama that lacks nuances and fails to pack an emotional punch, but at least it's mildly engaging thanks to warm, heartfelt performances and exquisite cinematography.",Rotten
"Two hours later I felt as if I was heartless, as all this film did was make me wish I had the last two hours back even after all the melodramatic pain and suffering.",Rotten
"Contrived or not, sad is sad, and My Sister's Keeper will have all but the most cement-hearted reaching for tissue.",Fresh
"Given how easily the filmmakers could have cranked up the string section and gone for the quivering lip in soft focus, their restraint is admirable.",Fresh
"Sad drama has heavy themes about and illness, family.",Fresh
"Call me crazy or overly conservative, but I find it completely reprehensible to have another child simply to use as an organ and tissue farm for another kid.",Rotten
A mawkish yet worthy enough addition to the summer line-up.,Fresh
"My Sister's Keeper targets tear ducts so ruthlessly, it might as well be sponsored by Kleenex.",Rotten
A film that overcomes an obscenely melodramatic setup to come by its tears honorably.,Fresh
"True, it's as contrived as the genre gets, but it nevertheless left me mourning the movie that might have been.",Rotten
"A surprisingly lovely movie about an absolutely awful subject, My Sister's Keeper features what also may be the year's first performance worthy of Oscar mention.",Fresh
"Undeniably manipulative, not only in its plot, but in its dramatization of it.",Rotten
"It's very emotional and often touching, but it's also got chemo, bone marrow extractions and a nihilistic view of death.",Fresh
"The weepfest movie of the summer, but it has more going for it than that.",Fresh
"My Sister's Keeper takes on a very tough subject, but ultimately it is too soft, too easy, and it dissolves like a tear-soaked tissue.",Rotten
My Sister's Keeper humanizes vexing questions about medical ethics without sacrificing rattling family drama.,Fresh
"Although the compelling courtroom drama gets forgotten for much of the movie, My Sister's Keeper also is relatively realistic about the physical and emotional toll of disease.",Fresh
My Sister's Keeper is a rare tearjerker where the viewer doesn't feel jerked around (most of the time).,Fresh
"Director Nick Cassavetes relies too much on montages with wispy songs about yearning and unicorns, but he gracefully balances the film's multiple viewpoints, which help us understand that the film's issues are not black and white.",Fresh
"My Sister's Keeper isn't quite a keeper, but it's a sturdy melodrama that earns those copious tears.",Fresh
"With solid performances and an intelligent script, My Sister's Keeper offers a moving and powerfully realistic portrait of a family stalked by tragedy that somehow manages to emerge from crisis battered but intact.",Fresh
"For all its awkward structure, the film is heartfelt and deeply affecting.",Fresh
My Sister's Keeper takes a compelling ethical dilemma and turns it into formulaic pap by trying relentlessly to ensure an emotional reaction with sentimental exploitation and plot contrivances.,Rotten
"Faced with a clear choice between an entirely original story and one told a thousand times before, director and co-writer Nick Cassavetes takes the easy, well trodden path.",Rotten
"An adaptation that, although departing dramatically from such key elements as the book's ending, will please fans.",Fresh
"An outrageous Lifetime Television courthouse drama, constructed in the artful style of a Sundance drama...",Fresh
"[L]ike that last rush of endorphins they tell us floods our bodies to prepare us for death... [W]ants you to sob, but with bittersweet acceptance and saccharine grief, not with rage or anger or denial...",Rotten
"As an example of the age old Hollywood weeper as post-modern semi-serious character study, Nick Cassavete's My Sister's Keeper is too safe to be wholly successful, too powerful to be merely pushed aside.",Fresh
Parental Content Review,Rotten
"What an agonizing, misguided, maudlin mess!",Rotten
"If My Sister's Keeper feels melodramatic and contrived, it is, at least, sincerely so.",Fresh
"My Sister's Keeper offers a couple of twists, one of them crucial and the other cruelly unnecessary and melodramatic.",Rotten
"My Sister's Keeper has a gutsy premise, but no guts.",Rotten
"My Sister's Keeper, like all tearjerkers, works as a ritual as much as it does art.",Fresh
"Their message in My Sister's Keeper? Cancer sucks, but there's always the balm of beach scenes and an emo soundtrack.",Rotten
"Bring lots of tissue. If you don't tear up watching My Sister's Keeper, at least just a little, then your heart is made of stone.",Fresh
"Remarkable in concept and utterly exquisite in its execution, this domestic drama at the deeply conflicted crossroads of family wounds and medical healing, would have baffled even Solomon as to the ultimate value of a child.",Fresh
Tears will be shed as the promised courtroom drama is displaced by other developments - Joan Cusack almost steals the pic as the lachrymose judge who has lost a young daughter herself.,Fresh
"...consistently manages to rise above its similarly-themed, undeniably low-rent brethren...",Fresh
"Easily the most poignant picture of the year, achieved without resorting to manipulative soap opera devices.",Fresh
The movie is a wafer thin translation of a really good book,Rotten
...will relieve six months worth of tears for audiences willing to take its cathartic journey.,Fresh
I found the movie to be really tough and challenging and enjoyable.,Fresh
I have a heart. I just don't want schlock.,Rotten
I felt manipulated.,Rotten
What might have been a pretty heady work quickly gives way to shameless manipulation and a screenplay that's both sloppy and contrived.,Rotten
"Where restraint might have raised up My Sister's Keeper, a heavy hand has brought it down.",Rotten
"The acting is excellent, but I can't say that My Sister's Keeper provides anything more than the standard TV movie ...",Rotten
A tear-fest medical drama that seems much longer than it is.,Rotten
...a high-class tear-jerker thanks to an intelligent script...sensitive direction...and strong performances...,Fresh
"Diaz is a whiny irrelevance, but sharp supporting work from Alec Baldwin and Joan Cusack makes the proceedings tolerable for boyfriends.",Rotten
You should consent to having treacle intravenously injected into your system sooner than go to see this Hollywood weepie.,Rotten
"Directed by Nick Cassavetes with a syrupiness that would, I imagine, have made his father John smack the New York sidewalks in fury.",Rotten
"It would be tough not to shed a tear for any child forced to look death in the face, but it's also a crying shame that such a delicate matter ends up being treated with an uncertain heavy hand.",Rotten
"Full of clunky voiceovers, corny music and maudlin montages, this manipulative yarn plays with issues of medical morality and parental duty only to discard them in favour of a manipulative paean to valuing life and accepting death.",Rotten
"With direction this leaden and scripting this ham-fisted, my suspicion is that there will be far too many dry eyes in the house.",Rotten
"A very satisfying, if emotionally draining, experience. Needless to say you should take a large box of hankies - + a bottle of water so you can rehydrate afterwards.",Fresh
"By the end we are screaming to yank our engines away from the forecourt as fuel spills - all that piano music, that gilded lighting, those glycerine tears - threatening a pyre of sense, sensibility and supersensitive subject choice.",Rotten
This medical-ethics drama is like a sustained assault on the tear ducts.,Rotten
"My Sister's Keeper ducks some of the bigger moral dilemmas, which may have added more grit. There again this is not a film with grit on its mind, just how quickly it can have you reaching for a handkerchief.",Rotten
"My Sister's Keeper becomes a well-heeled weepie in which the family's comfortable existence, despite the misfortunes of fate, is hardly challenged at all.",Fresh
This movie cheapens the experience of a family struggling to come to terms with the impending loss of a loved one. Cry? I very nearly did. Just not in the way Cameron probably hoped.,Rotten
My Sister's Keeper might have earned its weepy moments if it had played fair with its central dilemma rather than putting forward a false choice.,Rotten
"The performances are first-rate, with special commendation to Vassilieva in a breakout performance as a teen striving for normalcy in spite of her cancer.",Fresh
"If the adults in My Sister's Keeper are repeatedly compromised in the honesty department, the children seem to embody truth physically.",Rotten
"Sometimes, a sad story isn't just a manipulative venture that makes you cry. Sometimes, as in 'The Notebook,' it's a tale well told that brings out honest emotions. Sometimes, it's in a movie such as 'My Sister's Keeper.'",Fresh
"Navigates a minefield of emotional explosives intelligently and sensitively, with excellent performances that strike the right balance between heartfelt and hand-wringing.",Fresh
The obnoxious calculation smothers what should've been a pure articulation of melancholy and a potent debate of morality.,Rotten
"There's no question that this is a really intriguing drama and a drama that I think deserved better treatment than it gets here because I think Nick Cassevetes -- I don't think he's a very good director, really.",Fresh
There is a touch of contrivance to the set-up that is not totally convincing and the film avoids much of the ethical arguments in favour of family drama. But I must admit to being affected.,Fresh
A morally ambiguous tearjerker with a twist.,Fresh
"Though the motives of My Sister's Keeper will seem dubious to some, there is no denying the performances on display keep everything in the realm of the watchable.",Rotten
"As manufactured Disease of the Week weepies go, Nick Cassavetes's drama based on a Jodi Picoult bestseller, is surprisingly moving.",Fresh
"The decision to avoid unnecessary sentimentality defines this film, elevating it to a more thoughtful if a touch less engaging arena, sacrificing emotional escapism for conversation provoking tragedy.",Fresh
"What starts as an exploration of the ethics of organ-donation and genetic selection, rapidly disintegrates into a sloppy, unstructured, tear-jerking mess.",Rotten
"Cassavetes...shows great skill in weaving bright moments -- even an adolescent romance -- into the gloom. It's still bittersweet, but like mass-produced cr√®me caramel, never too bitter.",Fresh
"[Cassavetes] refuses to let the material speak for itself, putting a famous-for-making-women-cry song behind almost every scene, and lingering on every sentimental moment.",Rotten
Bring the tissues. This film works.,Fresh
"[I]ntelligent, moving and even occasionally funny, although you might want to bring along a few tissues just in case.",Fresh
"I tried to keep an open mind, hoping something would win me over. It didn't happen.",Rotten
"The film has a profound and compelling premise. Regrettably, it seems intent on being about everything but that premise.",Rotten
My Sister's Keeper demands nothing less than a tidal wave of tears.,Rotten
The film has its flaws and swims in meticulously crafted schmaltz... yet also has well-conceived tender moments hiding in the fringes.,Fresh
"Strong performances, and a subtle script make director Cassavetes film one of the better tearjerkers of the year...",Fresh
"Yes, unabashed weeper My Sister's Keeper has that Hollywood sheen -- but it's the unexpectedly piercing realness of this family's anguish that's going to get you. Just try to hold back the waterworks.",Fresh
"My Sister's Keeper is a committee-approved nerve-snapper that, much like its main character, has been genetically engineered to MAKE! YOU! CRY!",Rotten
"Tearjerker that aims for rarefied feelings as well as knee-jerk, sentimental moments.",Fresh
"It is effective, but only in the most shallow, manipulative way, and results in a cowardly, movie-of-the-week exit that isn't worthy of these engaging sisters.",Rotten
Fans of Picoult's novel are likely to be at least modestly disturbed by the liberties that Cassavetes takes.,Fresh
I loved Fat Jesus. A comedy that's funny and naughty. This is a franchise. Mike Tyson has a career in movies!,Fresh
"Head-poundingly (in a good way), sidesplittingly funny.",Fresh
"Proudly inappropriate and buoyed by both a clever script and some obvious chemistry between the film's male leads, director Todd Phillips' comedy will play like gangbusters with men and may even attract some women who know and love knuckleheads.",Fresh
The Hangover is surprisingly clever as well as R-rated rowdy.,Fresh
"Miraculously, we still like Alan and Stu and Phil even as we crack up when they get tazed and beaten. Phillips has pulled off a feat of balance that rivals Cirque du Soleil down the Strip.",Fresh
"This tried and true plot line not only works, but works hilariously.",Fresh
"A comedy that stays weird and wild for the first two-thirds, only to disappoint in the final act.",Fresh
"The male trio is so funny, the situations so wacky, the lingo so foul, and other characters and props so eccentric (absent groom, missing tooth, lost chickens, a tiger, Mike Tyson singing) that you gladly and joyously join the wild ride.",Fresh
This surefire summer hit might even get Vegas back on a winning streak.,Fresh
Very funny.,Fresh
I think this is going to be a big comedy hit this summer.,Fresh
"Director Phillips wrings his scenario for consistent semi-dark humor, letting his odd-couple leads go for broke and wielding mystery as a comedic spur that keeps the proceedings from dragging.",Fresh
"...I think I can safely predict that ""The Hangover"" will join March's ""I Love You Man"" as one of the funniest films of the year.",Fresh
Todd Phillips masterfully shows that the combination of unexpected ingredients can create a potent chemistry that elevates a simple premise.,Fresh
"To its credit, ""The Hangover"" transfers to the audience the smelly, still inebriated state that the title promises.",Fresh
"The Hangover, Todd Phillips' return to fratastic form after the disappointing School for Scoundrels, marks itself as an aesthetic step up for the Old School director right from the get go.",Fresh
Ninety minutes of pure perverse laughter,Fresh
"Coarse but only intermittently amusing example of boys' night out...Among guy flicks this one comes in around the middle, neither unmentionably terrible nor particularly memorable.",Rotten
"If you've seen the trailer for The Hangover, then you've pretty much seen all the funny parts. You've probably also unspooled a movie in your head that's way more fun than what's actually screening in theaters.",Rotten
... Just might be the funniest movie of the decade.,Fresh
You'll laugh three or four times and probably won't remember why.,Rotten
"The Hangover has scattered laughs (many in the cathartically funny end-credit montage), but overall it's more amusing than hilarious.",Fresh
It's so funny it might convince you that sometimes the raunchy journey is worth the laugh-out-loud reward.,Fresh
"It's hilarious in spurts and several bit players score, but the movie doesn't have enough momentum to carry it through the dead spots.",Rotten
An unusually palatable entry in a rancid genre.,Fresh
"While I'm not saying you have to be hungover to appreciate The Hangover, having a wild night out before seeing this the next day might enhance this hilarious experience.",Fresh
"An energetic jaunt through ribald territory, centered on the theory that some guys just can't handle Vegas.",Fresh
"The Hangover's nutty, naughty fun that never takes itself the least bit seriously.",Fresh
A film so completely stupid and hateful that you get the sense that it was financed by the Atlantic City tourism board as a way of besmirching the good name of their chief competition.,Rotten
"Who would have thought? The Hangover is a crude, crass comedy that manages to be smart at the same time - oh, and funny as hell.",Fresh
"A cheerfully outrageous comedy, with much of the humor coming from discovering with them just how appallingly they have violated every standard of appropriate behavior.",Fresh
"A geek bonding guy movie just as easily titled, I Love You, Men, this in-your-face grossout about grown males in pursuit of living out their wannabe vice junkie daydreams badly, detours into beyond crude humor more often sour than sweet.",Rotten
"The Hangover remains unrepentantly irresponsible and hilarious throughout, culminating with what could be the funniest montage ever to grace a picture's end credits. The summer's first sleeper hit has arrived.",Fresh
"It has a couple of stand-out characters in Ed Helms and Zach Galifianakis, and enough T-shirt-worthy catchphrases to keep the chuckles coming.",Fresh
"As goofy and strange as the situations become, we wouldn't have any investment in this sometimes distasteful silliness if we didn't like these guys.",Fresh
"The Hangover is a breathless stroke of comedic genius; one of those movies where, when it comes out on DVD and you have a bunch of friends over, you won't be able to watch just one scene.",Fresh
"The latest in the wave of post-Judd Apatow Bad Lad comedies, The Hangover is rowdy, scurrilous, and, for about three-quarters of its running time, a lot more hilarious than it has any right to be.",Fresh
It's a film about forgetting that seems designed to be forgotten.,Rotten
easily one of the funniest films of the year.,Fresh
"Big laughs, tigers, Heather Graham breast-feeding, naked Asian man beating the boys with a tire iron, Mike Tyson singing Phil Collins%u2026 I'm trying, but I'm not finding much to dislike here.",Fresh
"Director Todd Phillips ups the ante on his ""Old School"" antics in ""The Hangover,"" a movie which solidifies the comic chops of Cooper and Helms and should make a star out of Galifianakis.",Fresh
"A fantastic blend of raunch and more cerebral, off-the-wall humor, this isn't a case of reinventing the wheel but shaping it so that it rolls pure.",Fresh
"Though the film falters toward the end, The Hangover is a side-splitting adventure you'll still be laughing about the morning after.",Fresh
Exactly the shot of drinking-age-and-up comedy the summer needs before the soda-pop PG-13 sticky-sweetness of summer blockbuster season hits.,Fresh
"The payoff to the mysteries isn't nearly as interesting as the setup, and the ending of the movie is disappointingly squishy. But while it's riding a hot streak, The Hangover is a rush.",Fresh
"If The Hangover sounds like a hybrid of Bachelor Party and Dude, Where's My Car, its kind of is. It has its share of both laugh-out-loud and WTF moments, but also contains scenes that deflate the comic momentum.",Fresh
"I'm going to say, at the risk of doing time in the blurbitentiary, that The Hangover is the Citizen Kane of bachelor party movies.",Fresh
"As if it wasn't bad enough to be stuck in Las Vegas with these middle-aged misanthropes, The Hangover does the inconceivable disservice of robbing the audience of that elusive sweet spot of GCA usefulness: the drunken escapade.",Rotten
The Hangover instantly has the feel of one for the ages.,Fresh
"Now this is what I'm talkin' about. The Hangover is a funny movie, flat out, all the way through. Its setup is funny. Every situation is funny",Fresh
Easily one of the funniest films so far this year.,Fresh
"Restores faith in Phillips and the vulgar passions of the R-rated comedy, assembling a smutty epic of irresponsibility that handles with a certain amount of routine, but still delivers huge on laughs and knowing cringes.",Fresh
"As forgettable as a night of hard drinking, this frat-level comedy is good for a few laughs but never quite gels.",Fresh
"[T]hinks it's edgy and envelope-pushing, but there's nothing terribly risque or dangerous about it... [H]int[s] at possibilities far more dangerous than it ever dares go near...",Rotten
"The rush of craziness like stealing cop cars and marrying strippers comes from the actual act of doing it--uh, so I've heard--not just being told about it the next day.",Rotten
No deep thoughts here -- just the kind of raucously vulgar entertainment that every summer needs. Indulge yourself without guilt.,Fresh
"Cooper, Helms and especially Galifianakis find the right tone to give Phillips' Vegas dream world a funny, slightly dangerous appeal.",Fresh
"Unless you find the man-infant Galifianakis appealing, you%u2019ll surely spend The Hangover wistfully remembering the days when Will Ferrell made good movies and Luke Wilson was still relevant.",Rotten
The guilty pleasure comedy hit of the summer has arrived. This could be the breakout role for Galifianakis.,Fresh
"This represents the worst sort of pandering slop, the type that appeases impressionable audiences who don't even realize they're being insulted.",Rotten
"While I'm not ready to call the film a triumph, its approach to humor is smart enough to benefit greatly from low expectations. Which is to say, it's an enjoyable piece of trash.",Fresh
"It's just funny - pretty much from start to finish, or at least whenever Zach Galifianakis' 'Fat Jesus' is on screen.",Fresh
"The script is really a marvel of invention as it finds myriad ways to sink the characters deeper and deeper into the abyss, and this is where many of the film's biggest laughs come into play.",Fresh
"Helms, Cooper and Galafianakis are a great comedy trio with each one bringing a different element to the movie.",Fresh
Who knew a Hangover could be so much fun?,Fresh
"The Hangover knows its place and plays right to it. If you see this movie, you'll probably be offended and definitely be disturbed, but you'll also laugh quite a bit.",Fresh
It's hard to think of any truly memorable moments from this creatively challenged outing.,Rotten
It's the funniest movie of the year.,Fresh
"By the end of the film, these guys are our pals.",Fresh
"The movie smells like a hit, but honestly: Helms excepted, did it need to be quite so blandly cast, or quite so lamely raunchy?",Rotten
It's a dizzying array of bawdy set pieces buoyed by a eclectic cast.,Fresh
It's a non-stop laugh riot that's destined to become a comedy classic.,Fresh
There is a sort of perverse brilliance or brilliant perverseness to be found in this story of a bachelor party gone terribly wrong.,Fresh
"The Hangover, like the condition for which it's named, has some spirited moments, but more often it stumbles and slurs, regurgitating earlier pleasures and praying for the fog to lift.",Rotten
"Amusing as it is, it never feels real.",Rotten
Memento meets Old School? It's party time.,Fresh
"If there is any justice in the universe, The Hangover will make Zach Galifianakis a household name.",Fresh
"Every summer needs at least one silly, dirty comedy, but The Hangover may end up being one of the few to actually get the mix right.",Fresh
"Much smarter than it needs to be and darker than you'd expect, The Hangover seems destined to be the big comedy of the summer.",Fresh
Surprisingly funny and smartly acted.,Fresh
You will not be ennobled. But you will be entertained.,Fresh
It distinguishes itself from other what-happens-in-Vegas comedies (practically a subgenre at this point) by setting an especially vivid scene and telling an actual story instead of pasting together random shenanigans the way many modern comedies do.,Fresh
"Superbly cast, well-written and so silly it makes your teeth ache.",Fresh
The Hangover is a cut above the typical contemporary guy-friendship comedy.,Fresh
"Early in this unraveling adventure, a Vegas tourist quips, ""Some guys just can't handle Vegas."" Yeah, we know a couple: writers Jon Lucas and Scott Moore.",Rotten
You're likely to hear all about it as friends and co-workers endlessly quote lines or re-create scenes.,Fresh
"Surrender your soul to its foul mesh of cheap cleverness and vulgarity. and you howl like a delighted demon. Resist, and you feel all sense and sensibility being crushed in its cogs.",Rotten
The funniest movie so far this year.,Fresh
"Waking up with a hangover and no memory of what happened the night before is an experience most people can relate to, but it's also a surefire device for comedy.",Fresh
"The Hangover should be a huge hit this summer for laugh-starved audiences; happily, it delivers.",Fresh
"This kind of 'one crazy night' tale relies on drum-tight structure to work. Without it, The Hangover sputters to a sentimental halt.",Rotten
This is a bromance so primitive it's practically Bro-Magnon.,Rotten
"Keep your expectations low, and you'll be amused.",Fresh
"A strong cast, a quirky script with some unexpected twists and a steady hand from the director's chair make this a desert ride on the wild side a worthy road trip.",Fresh
"Even though Apatow has no fingerprints over this movie, The Hangover follows in the same surprise-me tradition: It takes us to the dumb side but comes back with something unexpectedly affecting.",Fresh
"It is a situation comedy dressed in narrative clothing, and the story it tells is less amusing than the high-concept premise.",Rotten
Parental Content Review,Rotten
With The Hangover Todd Phillips has officially become the Uwe Boll of comedy.,Rotten

"Would I have liked this film better if I went in cold, having never seen the trailer? Perhaps, but I'll never know.",Rotten
"Phillips, with a script credited to Jon Lucas and Scott Moore (and with loads of loose-limbed interpretations from the cast), captures the amity among a group of grown men set loose without spouses, girlfriends, or sobriety to hinder them. (Or help.)",Fresh
"The Hangover is sure to make moviegoers laugh so hard that their heads will hurt (in a good way, of course).",Fresh
"The Hangover ain't art, but Phillips has shaped the hardcore hilarity into the summer party movie of all our twisted dreams.",Fresh
"Outrageousness proves hard to sustain, and after a stomach-lurchingly quick start, The Hangover slows down and, by the third act, fizzes out like Alka-Seltzer in a highball glass.",Rotten
What hangover? This movie is safe as milk.,Fresh
"Comedies this good don't happen by accident, even if a little organization could have made The Hangover much better than what it is.",Fresh
"A stripper, a stolen police car, a tazer gun demonstration, illegal drugs, a used condom, a naked Asian gambler, a bawling baby, a bemused chicken and a tiger are part of this outrageously rowdy and funny comedy that is anything but a headache",Fresh
"As gleefully dirty as Old School, and maybe funnier.",Fresh
"It's a ridiculously funny movie, yes-- but it's also a skillful picture, blessed with an ingeniously constructed narrative that keeps the viewer involved while taking full advantage of its gifted cast and their specific comedic mojo.",Fresh
A great buddy flick that could be the surprise hit of the summer.,Fresh
The film also develops in a way that although over-the-top feels grounded in a recognisable reality.,Fresh
"Unlike most so-called ""comedies,"" this one can claim the virtue of being reasonably funny.",Fresh
The juxtaposition of the characters is ingenious. This is one of the funniest movies I've seen in a long time.,Fresh
"Unlike last years rather uninspiring What Happens in Vegas, the hysterical The Hangover actually ends up doing Sin City proud.",Fresh
"The jokes and sight gags are hit and miss, but the plot and characters are compelling and it has a lot of twists and turns that keep you guessing right up to the end.",Fresh
"The plot climaxes in what could be the best credit roll outtakes in movie history. If not that, they certainly rank as one of the best-ever punch lines.",Fresh
"""The Hangover"" pretty much demands you leave your Political Correctness Cap at home and urges you to eschew your Thinking Cap as well.",Fresh
"When the years have passed and the buzz has worn off, I honestly feel that people will look back at The Hangover and wonder what they laughed at in 2009. It's the Zima of movie comedies.",Rotten
...the movie suffers from a variety of problems that are ultimately exacerbated by Phillips' progressively desperate efforts at wringing laughs out of material that could hardly be more tedious.,Rotten
The Polaroids of the bachelor party shown during the end titles deliver the genuine laughs the movie has promised; they're better than the entire movie that preceded it.,Rotten
"Just as a marriage is built on love and promises kept, so can a bromance. ""The Hangover"" honors and cherishes that idea in slickness and stealth, and will have audiences unsure of how to say Zach Galifianakis but certain he's a star.",Fresh
There's a better cast here than there deserves to be.,Fresh
"Amusing but a bit overrated. Yes, it's a great comic premise but only partially fulfilled in a raucous summer comedy aimed squarely at the frat boy in all of us.",Fresh
"A picture which periodically pushes the envelope further than the average moviegoer is probably capable of stomaching via ill-advised departures into such taboo subjects as child molestation, all in search of a cheap joke.",Fresh
"Vulgar, obscene and offensive, The Hangover is one of the funniest movies I've seen in a very long time and is surely destined to become a comedy classic.",Fresh
"There is a lull toward the end, where you almost become as exhausted as the boys on the trip. But (and I rarely say this) thank goodness for those end credits.",Fresh
"While its boisterous fun has strong libidinous overtones, it never takes the plunge into full, frothing raunch.",Fresh
There are people who will not find this film amusing. Amish elders. Infants. An Iowan farmer named Burl. And that should cover it. The rest of you: bring a change of underwear.,Fresh
"If there's a problem with 'The Hangover' (and other films of its ilk), it's the at best ambivalent, at worst hostile relationship to women...",Fresh
"the kind of brilliant comedy that will have you gasping, laughing so hard you'll have tears in your eyes.",Fresh
There are some funny moments in the movie but there are some unfunny ones as well. It's an okay movie but it doesn't live up to the hype.,Rotten
"Great casting benefits the movie hugely, as does a premise centered around the mystery of what happened, but its choppy editing does it no favors.",Fresh
a cleverly vulgar comedy that manages to take a tired conceit and make it feel inventive and consistently funny,Fresh
It gets the job done thanks in large part to the breakout performance given by Galifianakis.,Fresh
"A fast-moving, constant joking, how funny is a guy pulling out his own tooth kind of movie.",Fresh
Stands up as a motion picture in addition to working as a delivery system for gags... as fine a mystery and character study as it is a comedy.,Fresh
"If a bachelor party bender is your thing, you've got company. I didn't say taste.",Rotten
"What makes any film work, and this is particularly true of comedy, is making it real, even though everything we're seeing is completely unbelievable. I laughed a lot with this one.",Fresh
"The performances are solid, with a special nod to the droll buffoonery of Zach Gilifianakis, whose character is out of it even when he is sober and alert.",Fresh
Raunchy comedy about a bachelor party gone wrong.,Rotten
"The revelations of the night before won't shock you (strippers, wedding chapel, drugs), but there's so much vomiting, car crashing and tasering of genitals that you don't have time to ponder how uninteresting the story really is.",Rotten
"Hilarious from go-to-whoa and visually compelling in its rarely seen Vegas-by-day aesthetic, The Hangover is the very definition of raucous entertainment, and will undoubtedly rate as one of the comedies of the year.",Fresh
Hangover shows no mercy in its quest for laughs.,Fresh
The Hangover is nothing special. It's a fair-to-middling bombardment of humor thrown against the wailing walls of Las Vegas. It misses as much as it hits.,Fresh
"The best bachelor party movie since, well, ""Bachelor Party""",Fresh
"You might be embarrassed by laughing at some of the silliness, but don't be: Everyone else will be cracking up, too.",Fresh
To call it 'atrocious' and 'loathsome' is to pussyfoot around the truth.,Rotten
"Pushing the envelope unlike anything the industry has offered us this year; ""The Hangover"" provides the escape factor. Prepare for the wild ride!",Fresh
"The cast is personable, the photography is attractive, the script is cleverly constructed and mildly amusing but there is nothing here that screams comedy classic.",Fresh
"It doesn't help that the central cast is almost entirely forgettable, from the smug lounge lizardry of Bradley Cooper to the boisterous Jack Black-lite of Zach Galifianakis.",Rotten
"An intriguing, time-hopping set-up is wasted on obnoxious characters, celebrity cameos and crass attempts at humour.",Rotten
"Consistently funny, The Hangover proves you don't need a big-name Hollywood cast to get big laughs. Destined to appeal to the lads everywhere, that the film doesn't only resort to gross-out gags means female audiences should give it a go.",Fresh
The lads duly lurch from one bewildering crisis to another.,Rotten
"It turns out to be every bit as crass, offensive and incorrect as you'd expect, but it's also - gulp! - really very funny an awful lot of the time, as well as bizarrely gripping.",Fresh
"Everything works here; the characters are funny, the set-ups are funny, the lines are funny.",Fresh
The Hangover amounts to a gut-bustingly funny boy's own comedy.,Fresh
"Debauched, depraved and very, very funny.",Fresh
The cracking script - a veritable treasure trove of smart one-liners - and beautifully-worked setpieces make this one of the most enjoyable comedies of the year.,Fresh
"Succeeding equally well as rowdy romp, what-happened mystery and man-crush comedy, /The Hangover/ is an unexpected winner.",Fresh
With a great soundtrack and script so sharp you might need to take plasters into the cinemas with you because you might come out with cuts... this is this summer's must see comedy.,Fresh
"Rude, crude and defiantly male, it's the ultimate phallocentric antidote to Sex And The City, and easily the funniest American comedy of the year.",Fresh
"Lewd, crude and exceptionally rude, the gags come thick and fast.",Fresh
A devilishly smart comedy gem that manages to blend the raunchy and the rowdy with some deliciously left-field humour.,Fresh
"The Hangover serves up a steady stream of big, dumb laughs, but you may feel a gnawing sense of guilt right afterwards.",Fresh
"A furiously paced, inventive and flat-out hilarious take on a tried-and-tested formula. An exemplary bromantic comedy that doesn't sacrifice heart in pursuit of laughs, maintaining plenty of the former and a superabundance of the latter.",Fresh
"Rude, crude and downright distasteful - this film is brilliant.",Fresh
"Laugh? Well, at least, on a tough Tuesday in Tube-meltdown London, one chuckled.",Fresh
"Some very funny, very non-PC dialogue is thrown about like a game of catch. The actors, virtually unknown, are terrific.",Fresh
A wee-inducingly funny bromance.,Fresh
One of the funniest films we've seen in many a moon.,Fresh
Easily the funniest film of the year. A must-see.,Fresh
"Hugely enjoyable and frequently hilarious, this is a sharply written comedy with strong comic performances from a terrific ensemble cast.",Fresh
"It's not very sophisticated, but this raucous comedy keeps us laughing with its sheer absurdity. The characters are very well-played and their interaction is genuinely hilarious, even if most of the jokes are pretty cheap.",Fresh
"This is top stuff. There's all the carnage, baps and humiliation you could want from a 15-rated comedy but it's pegged around a smart plot that actually holds up. Take out the laughs, and The Hangover would still work as a gripping, if barmy thriller.",Fresh
"The comedy is consistently funny and the cast? Well, they're hardly A-list, but therein lies the magic as they're all hugely likeable and pair that with a funny script and you get guaranteed entertainment.",Rotten
It kicks this sub-genre up a gear with an anarchic sense of fun and a consistently high gags-to-giggle ratio that knows when to push the envelop of taste and when to pull back a little.,Fresh
"It is sometimes coarse, and there are some scurrilous scenes. But this is an inventive, funny, entertaining movie.",Fresh
"Now I'm not sure if urinating explicitly on screen is one giant step for mankind or not, but one should not be surprised that the comedy in which this has occurred has been directed by Todd Phillips.",Fresh

"'The Hangover' is an outrageous, entertaining, laugh-out-loud classic from beginning to end.",Fresh
"Who knew that we needed a 'Dude, Where's My Car?' for grownups?",Fresh
"The director and his screenwriters have come up with the funniest film to appear in ages. It avoids the predictable crudity and silly laddishness (well, almost) you'd expect, and delights with zinging one-liners and charming performances.",Fresh
"The director, harnessing the talents of a relatively unknown cast, creates a genuine minor classic of the genre.",Fresh
"This is an above par effort, excellently played and just naughty enough to be thought daring as well as amusingly spiteful.",Fresh
Rising-star Bradley Cooper and gang represent the dirtbag element that has become acceptable in contemporary comedy.,Rotten
"You could say his new film The Hangover is the Reservoir Dogs of party movies. Reservoir Dogs was a heist film that never shows you the heist, and The Hangover is about a wild night in Vegas that only shows the aftermath.",Fresh
The Hangover is funny but not deeply so. There's a difference between funny incidents piled up in a line and people who make us laugh because of who they are.,Fresh
"Comedies have rarely been as lazy as this, nor have they been so adamantly stupid.",Rotten
Galifianakis is a revelation of wrong.,Fresh
"My only complaint about The Hangover is that so many excellent moments were ruined by the preview. The Hangover, particularly Ed Helms, is very funny. Don't bring a family member and don't try any of this at home.",Fresh
"Easily, one of summer's more outrageous, funny comedies.",Fresh
"It is classless, it is tasteless, it is idiotic, it is juvenile and it is something your mother totally wouldn't approve of. But it also is flat-out hilarious.",Fresh
A comedy binge-fest you won't regret in the morning.,Fresh
"It is easily the most unlabored comedy of the recent past. But seriously, how many times has a story like this been told?",Fresh
You'd have to be drunk...,Rotten
"The Hangover isn't painful to watch. If friends drag you to this movie, you won't hate them afterwards. But maybe it'll seem a lot funnier if you are drinking.",Rotten

"The raucous, raunchy laughs are indeed plentiful and the gags often outrageous, but what really drives the film is the unpredictability of the script.",Fresh
The Hangover's witless regression is unforgivable.,Rotten
"Question: What do Mike Tyson's tiger, a chicken, a horrible effeminate Chinese man stereotype naked in a car trunk, a stolen police car, a baby, a missing tooth and Phil Collins' music all have in common? Answer: Nothing...",Fresh
"...apparently, I have no sense of humor for finding so little joy in the runaway hit comedy 'The Hangover.'",Rotten
"works not because it is a comedy, but because its unimpressive comedic content is framed by much more interesting detective story",Fresh
"The real underlying message of The Hangover, as in most of Phillips' films, is that women are shrews, whores and/or fools-though Galifinakis is the only one to deal with the homoerotic subtext within the male bonding.",Rotten
"Quite entertaining as an entry in this tried-and-true genre of ""guys going on a inadvertent wacky adventure,"" and I like how this one is set up as a kind of mystery.",Fresh
"Todd Philips, who wrote and directed Road Trip and Old Scool, wrote Borat, and even plays the coked out Israeli dude in the elevator in The Hangover, has had his finger on the pulse of modern comedy cinema for a decade.",Fresh
The stupid fun of The Hangover is worth experiencing at least once. [Blu-ray],Fresh
"Bachelor Party meets Dude, Where's My Car (and about as entertaining as the two of them averaged together.)",Fresh
The Hangover doesn't contain the constant rip-roaring laughs the likes of Superbad or some of the Frat Pack's best.,Fresh
"The Hangover never pretends to be anything other than what it is, and, partially for that reason, it carries quite a kick.",Fresh
"A fun time is had watching these three men piece together a night that never was, something of an old school detective story mixed with a heavy dose of adult humour. Better comedies have been released, yet not many as brazen as The Hangover.",Fresh
"It's good for wasting time and pondering the absurdity of not-so-random events, but not for much else.",Rotten
"I can definitely understand why it was a humongous hit, but when all is said and done, once was enough for this partier...",Fresh
"The Hangover might not be top class indie pop art, but the film represents the best of what comedy can provide -- pure, unadulterated, slaphappy entertainment. And there's nothing wrong with that.",Fresh
"I highly recommend going into this film blind, just to keep some of the surprises from being ruined. Oh, and being a 21-year-old male will also really help you to enjoy this flick.",Fresh
"Starting on Monday, Coogan and Bryden share meals . . . and what passes for conversation. When they're not insufferable, they're boring",Rotten
A younger generation is finding new stupid things to do underneath the desert sun.,Fresh
"If the movie's gleeful rush into areas of questionable comedic taste occasionally raises an eyebrow here and there, the end sequence will sear them right off.",Fresh
"Just when you think things can't get any more farcical, they do: The Hangover is the Crank of comedy.",Fresh
"The kind of brilliant comedy that will have you gasping, laughing so hard you'll have tears in your eyes and rocking back in your chair from laughter.",Fresh
"The galaxy Galifianakis is beaming in from is infinitely more fascinating than the one this film occupies, but his visits from Beserko World are more than worth it.",Fresh
"This is lazy, condescending half-assed filmmaking. When in doubt, simply slap a piece of rap music overtop of the action.",Rotten
... I went in to The Hangover with low expectations but ended up laughing more times than I thought I would.,Fresh
"In the case of The Hangover, Phillips made a decent diversion, but no classic; like its heroes you'll have a good time, then forget most of it when you wake up the following morning. It's a movie, not a film.",Fresh
"The movie, in the end, feels as as shabby as the unfulfilled lives that, we assume, these men will resume once the fun and games are over.",Rotten
"Though it looks like just another men-will-be-guys-will-be-boys-will-be-idiots affair, this well-scripted affair still stands up as a refreshingly unpredictable laugh machine.",Fresh
"Maybe, just maybe, the movie drags like a half-detached muffler and for some reason nobody wants to mention it.",Rotten
Galifianakis went from being an alt-comedy idol to a mainstream pop culture figure. The Hangover still feels like a breath of fresh air.,Fresh
Here's a comedy that understands how to be raunchy and smart -- and isn't afraid to get a laugh at any expense.,Fresh

"if you can think past the thirty second mark, the house of cards that is the script dissolves faster than cotton candy in the rain",Rotten

"A botched remake...A real thriller has you on the edge of your seat; watching this one, you're more liable to sit back and snooze.",Rotten
"Dylan Walsh's demeanor is more compelling than the small handful of perfunctory kill scenes, all of which you'll see from six miles away.",Rotten
"Poorly scripted and executed, this quickie slasher remake suffers from weak casting and doesn't even exploit the sexual politics involved in a major gender change from the 1987 feature, which satirized the rigid family values and has become a classic.",Rotten

[Nelson] McCormick has crafted a horror remake so undistinguished it makes Prom Night look like a masterpiece of transgressive filmmaking.,Rotten
The Stepfather is studio-produced drivel that puts a negative label on horror movies and psychological chillers. The only pleasure to be had from watching it is to so easily be able to pick it apart.,Rotten
"Comparing the original to this one is like comparing regular basketball to donkey basketball--a perfectly good thing has been needlessly ""improved"" by making everything bigger and dumber and by allowing a bunch of jackasses to dump all over it.",Rotten
"The original was a no-frills, psychology-based affair that got most of its juice from the conflict between the dad and his suspicious stepdaughter, but the new one is needlessly complicated and more overt.",Fresh
"This kind of film needs a ""R"" rating. Making it ""PG-13"" leaves even horror fans yawning. And, there's not enough drama or originality to keep anyone glued to this very poor remake. Just leaves you wanting the original. Paul Chambers, CNN.",Rotten
"A little more guts - not necessarily more gory -- could have turned The Stepfather into a real re-imagining, not just a re-heating; what we get is just another trip down memory lane that runs out of gas.",Rotten
"There are some movies that should not be re-made. This is one of them, as proven by this updated, cliche-filled version which fails to build up the necessary tension and truncates the mystery.",Rotten
"Shallow and inert, ""The Stepfather"" goes through the motions of a suspense film without ever broaching the horror genre that director Joseph Ruben employed in the original. Talk about ""unclear on the concept,"" this remake doesn't even get the genre right.",Rotten
"This perfunctory retread had a tame, made-for-TV feel, and not just because the humdrum cast is composed of network and cable B-listers.",Rotten
This remake turns a fondly remembered horror/thriller into a mild and tedious suspense film.,Rotten
"Even by horror-remake standards, The Stepfather sets the bar for pointlessness.",Rotten
Better to honor history and rent the original.,Rotten
"The trouble with the movie, apart from its rather monotonous dourness of tone, is that everyone in the family... comes off as tougher, smarter, and quicker on the draw than the stepfather who's supposed to be outfoxing them.",Rotten
"The Stepfather is that rarity, an effective remake of a screen classic that can stand alone on its own considerable merits.",Fresh
A clumsy remake of the 1987 cult thriller.,Rotten
It's hard to get absorbed in a story with so many unresolved issues.,Rotten
"I didn't think anyone could match Terry O'Quinn's riveting performance in the 1987 film, but Dylan Walsh nails the title role in this remake.",Fresh
That last stormy night of violence should be the shocker. Giving away his ruthlessness in earlier killings robs the movie of it its payoff as it saps the climax of much of its power.,Rotten
"Riddled with implausible situations, including many instances of Creepy Stepdad appearing suddenly in doorways and mirrors, and zero instances of genuine suspense or style.",Rotten
Dylan Walsh shines in the title role but the film is only mildly entertaining,Rotten
"Ooh, daddy! If you want some old-fashioned cheesy suspense, look no farther than 'The Stepfather.'",Rotten
"The Stepfather is, finally, only as good as its stepfather -- and Dylan Walsh ain't bad.",Fresh
"If you call a film The Stepfather, then your title character -- in this case, David Harris (Dylan Walsh) -- should have the decency to marry into that perfect little family that he's predisposed to butcher and kill.",Rotten
Wait till your father gets home... on DVD.,Rotten
"As characters get startled but you don't and you suspenselessly wait for everyone to figure out what we realized long ago (Mr. Harris kills people, then 105 minutes of your life), you may well wonder about the bloody point of it all.",Rotten

Astonishingly dull and carefully scrubbed of all but the most sanitized violence in the name of securing a PG-13 rating.,Rotten
...yet another toothless and entirely needless horror-movie remake.,Rotten
"There's mayhem all over the place and not a policeman, or much logic, in sight. Watchable nonsense, with performances better than the story deserves.",Rotten
Clich√©-ridden and full of plot-holes.,Rotten
"Not so much a contemporary re-make of Joseph Ruben's 1987 psychological thriller as a lobotomised bastard step-child: over-plotted, over-long, and stripped of the original's sharp, satirical subversion of suburban family values.",Rotten
"If the movie's attic-bound climax is a little predictable and the plot holes rather gaping, The Stepfather, unlike many of its more prestigious A-class competitors, is never less than entertaining.",Fresh
"It's all very silly, but effective popcorn entertainment.",Fresh
Nelson McCormick is ridiculously lax with inventive or plausible staging: it's the kind of movie where a door can't open without thunderclaps and the bad guy flinging himself into the frame.,Rotten
"The Stepfather is full of unintentional laughs, shameless plot contrivances and cheap scare tactics, but this adds to the fun once you've tapped into the risible nature of the production.",Rotten
"Lazy, predictable and seriously lacking in shocks.",Rotten
This rehash - toned (and dumbed) down for adolescent audiences by the director responsible for taking the slash out of Prom Night - provides thin gruel.,Rotten
"Mercilessly talky and deathly dull, this bloodless, sex-less misfire plays more like a housewife-baiting telemovie than the taut, teen-centric psycho-thriller it's supposed to be.",Rotten
McCormick's lacklustre reboot is just another indistinguishable psycho thriller.,Rotten
"A pointless, dumbed-down remake of a slasher movie of the same name.",Rotten
"Uninspiring and, crucially, not all that scary. There are no attempts either to explore the killer's motivation and none of the original's black humour.",Rotten
It has some good moments but there are much better relationships you could be having at the cinema than with The Stepfather.,Rotten
Fond memories of Joseph Ruben's thrillingly unpleasant B-movie of 1987 will be offended by this bland and almost blood-free remake.,Rotten
"The new version is serviceable, bland and forgettable.",Rotten
This is multiplex fodder for the (very) undemanding: they should give this kind of cinematic junk food away free with the popcorn.,Rotten
The Stepfather is watchable enough in a good bad movie sort of way but the finale is disappointing and it fails to improve on the original film.,Rotten
Forgettable but watchable pap - in a leave-your-brain-at-home sort of way.,Rotten
Any subtlety or implicit social satire to be found in Joseph Ruben's original went out with the last neighborhood trash pickup. Too bad the service was canceled before it could haul away this waste-of-time remake. [Blu-ray],Rotten
"The genre has diverged into two paths: the brutally gruesome and the suspenseful. This is going for the latter, which would have been fine if it were in fact thrilling.",Rotten
Horror remake has more tension than blood.,Fresh
What a shame that the remake fell into the unwieldy hands of the same jokers responsible for last year's execrable Prom Night redo.,Rotten

"A sumptuous, richly composed drama that considers big, broad emotional issues with a sweeping cinematic canvas.",Fresh
An encoffiner works outside the box in this enthralling winner of the Oscar for Best Foreign Picture of 2008.,Fresh
It feels like a singularly great film when one understands its plot as a daringly paradoxical apologia for Japan's moribund taboo.,Fresh
The sweeping music and bucolic landscape serve to heap on the emotion to Takita's already heavy-handed manipulation.,Rotten
Departures needed a little more work in the morgue -- like cutting to the bone.,Rotten
This is truly masterful and glorious filmmaking that's guaranteed a spot in my Top 10 of the year.,Fresh
"It's far too long, too self-conscious of its dramatic intentions, and too emotionally distant.",Rotten
"Like Sunshine Cleaning, this is a gentle comic tale of grisly ‚Ä®employment opportunity in desperate times. Only Departures is tender and, at times, rather squishy.",Fresh
"""Departures"" is a brilliantly written and performed story that transcends its themes of ritualized catharsis to bring the audience to a fresh understanding of man's need to make peace with the deceased.",Fresh
"Departures is built for simplicity, and, if nothing else, the appeal to decency and integrity of this sweetly old-fashioned tale make it a must for Bernie Madoff's prison Netflix queue.",Fresh

Easily the best movie I've seen thus far this year...beautifully done.,Fresh

"The performances are nice, the vibe is pretty much spot-on, but the movie itself almost can't help but under whelm, none of it ever rising to the level it needs to in order to fully connect.",Rotten
The film is far from perfect but has enough going on to compensate for its excessive length and some sentimentality.,Fresh
"Though events unravel predictably, the film is profoundly affecting, thanks to a well-written story, rich characters and superlative acting.",Fresh
"Fully deserving of every ounce of gold on its Oscar, Departures' amazing achievement is in being a film about death that is so truly beautiful, joyful and life-affirming.",Fresh
"It is, I'm afraid, unlikely to reflect much glory on the Oscar nomination process and the voters in general.",Rotten
"Overlong, predictable in its plotting and utterly banal in its blending of comic whimsy and melodramatic pathos.",Rotten
"A quiet, measured picture, somewhat clinical in its opening passages. But that gives way to the tremendous emotion of its closing sequences, and that final scene is a wrecker.",Fresh
"...the senior supporting players in the film are affecting and the film's underlying sentiment is honorable, but lead actor Masahiro Motoki shamefacedly mugs through this cloying and cliched film which director Takita lets drag on interminably.",Rotten
"Though not unpleasant, Departures can't reconcile its bawdy sense of humor with the tiresome sentimentality that always lurks not far behind.",Rotten
"Departures is a film steeped in warmth, tenderness and genuine conflict.",Fresh
Incredibly moving.,Fresh
"An overlong, sap-happy crowd-pleaser.",Rotten
"The ultimate beauty of the film rests in its symbolic details that bridge the abyss between the living and the dead. As the French might say, it is to make one cry.",Fresh
"Departures is such an elegant, beautifully mounted meditation on death, funeral customs and parent-child relations that you may find yourself sniffling and resisting simultaneously.",Fresh
A wistful masterpiece.,Fresh
I found myself watching the clock and begging for this bloated opus to end.,Fresh
Yojiro Takita's movie simultaneously tickles tears of mourning as it wrings laughs about the meaning of life.,Fresh
"Despite its Hollywood-friendliness, Departures never seems less than an utterly sincere, four-hankie movie about finding oneself.",Fresh
"It breaks no new ground, offers no audacious insights or rude revelations; toe follows tac as surely as tac follows tic.",Rotten
The creepiest aspect of Departures -- dead people -- ends up being what's most beautiful about it.,Fresh
"Departures quietly subverts aesthetic and emotional expectations. There are moments where the story could turn maudlin or veer into bad taste, but the high-minded intent is never lost.",Fresh
This is the kind of tastefully poignant drama that asks its audience to confront taboos and then pats them on the back for doing so.,Fresh
"It is the type of film that needs some time to find its story and its characters. This thoughtful drama is pretty rewarding, though the very deliberate tempo may test the patience of some.",Fresh
"There's naturally a lot of death, but Departures is also about the circle of life, family relationships, pride in one's purpose, and all the messiness those things can bring.",Fresh
"It is as polished as it is heavy-handed, and it leaves one under a spell.",Fresh
"Such modestly crafted moral tales sometimes manage win the audience over, but here the tone wavers too much for sincerity to be felt.",Rotten
"Occasionally goes saccharine, [but] mostly succeeds in telling an unusual story in an engaging way.",Fresh
"There is nothing so sparkling to this film at first glance. It's a film about man's mortality and how he handles it, but death is not cleverly hidden inside a bigger story. It's a wake-up slap in the face about the gritty part of dying: the bodies.",Fresh
Departures is a loving tribute to the Japanese way of death.,Fresh
The winning nature of the performances outweighs Takita's more obvious choices.,Fresh
"Departures is sometimes macabre and sometimes manipulative, but the way it speaks to the spirit is miraculous.",Fresh
"...feels like two films, one which is a perceptive and naturalistic study of modern life in Japan, and one which is an animated Hallmark card of montages and soaring strings...",Fresh
"A compassionate and wry character study of a man who, finding himself at a crossroads, is reborn through death.",Fresh
"One of the best movies released this year, it will be included on my year-end top 10 list. This movie has a personal touch that never wears out its welcome...",Fresh
"Absolutely, beautifully, tear duct openingly right.",Fresh
"The ending, which involves a rock, would wring tears from a stone.",Fresh
"Redeems a trite 'redemptive' story about family with hushed, beautifully staged sequences of 'encoffinment'...",Fresh
A moving celebration of life through showing reverence for death.,Fresh
"The film's tone lies, appropriately, somewhere between life, death, and the inadvertent humor that comes from finally accepting the yin/yang perfection of both and getting on with what comes between.",Fresh
A surprisingly uplifting examination of life and loss.,Fresh
The film has enjoyed tremendous acclaim but I hesitate to recommend it unreservedly. Better to lower your expectations and discover those elements that touch you most deeply without waiting for the film to deliver something that it doesn't really promise,Fresh
"Departures is a great film and, yes, you're going to need your reading glasses -- this one is subtitled.",Fresh
"Oscar can be a big softie, as proved by how it presented itself to this sweet, sober chamber piece about living life and handling death.",Fresh
"Yojiro Takita has crafted a rich, memorable and thoroughly unconventional film that celebrates finding your own particular place in a world full of surprising opportunities.",Fresh
The film seduces us into this world with such affection and beauty.,Fresh
"Beautifully acted and classically filmed, Departures is a gentle, wise, immensely appealing film.",Fresh
"Like the art of encoffinment itself, Departures unfolds with a delicacy and precision that slowly captivates the viewer.",Fresh
It's an affecting experience (you'll need to bring some tissues) but rest assured it's a joyous one too.,Fresh
Takita eventually pushes the emotions too hard but by then I had lost all resistance. It's a beautiful film but take two hankies.,Fresh
"Departures is about life, death, grief and loss, but it's also, in a quietly effective way, about coming to terms with expectations.",Fresh
"Despite a lengthy running time and a few pacing issues, Departures is still worth seeing, thanks to its moving script and engaging performances.",Fresh
"Heart-warming, funny, wise and profound. Not to be missed.",Fresh
"The movie gestures towards deep emotions, but an abiding soft-grained superficiality effectively insulates us from the piercing realities of grief.",Rotten
"Doesn't quite justify the enormous plaudits heaped upon its shoulders, but a warm-hearted comedy-drama with its own likeably odd sensibility.",Fresh
"Fascinating, witty and heartfelt.",Fresh
Yjir Takita's bitter-sweet tale of the Japanese funeral trade plays a bit like a formal service itself.,Rotten
A safe and emotionally generous crowd-pleaser.,Fresh
"Moments of clarity and pragmatism are contradicted by flashes of inanity and dry, if well-delivered humour.",Fresh
Departures's whimsical take on the Japanese funeral industry proves surprisingly funny.,Fresh
"Departure's cynicism, ironically, is what makes the optimism of its last act so moving.",Fresh
A sentimental but beguiling charmer of a film.,Fresh
"In the end, it's powerfully moving, and perhaps a bit too nice.",Fresh
Director Yojiro Takita and writer Kundo Kayama ... aren't afraid to give you an emotional punch as well as a punchline.,Fresh
This Japanese film's receipt of the award for best foreign-language picture at this year's Oscars was a case of the Academy favouring bland sentimentality.,Rotten
"The film, mostly set in a wintry landscape surrounded by snow-capped mountains, is fastidiously composed.",Fresh
"This heartfelt, unpretentious, slyly funny Japanese film is worth waiting for.",Fresh
like the unfolding of a Mozart concerto,Fresh
"Lead Masahiro Motoki apprenticed with real nakanshi for the role, and you become entranced by his performance, and the gentle clash of ritual and grief, custom and modernity.",Fresh
"Death is normal, and so are responsibilities, reconciliations and retreats from what we think are our dreams. In a resolution about identifying ourselves, and loved ones, in life and death, ""Departures"" shows some people must be left just as they went.",Fresh
No doubt the best movie you'll see this year about the Japanese traditional funeral business.,Fresh
"The scripting of Departures (by Kundo Koyama, the one-man TV-drama writing factory who nurtured such delights as Iron Chef) is embarrassingly clunky and obvious: the movie's essential hollowness reveals itself with unusual starkness.",Rotten
"The laughter and family fights that break out at funerals might be part of this movie's rural, working-class eye. Departures favors farmland and old-fashioned wood-fired bathhouses over the Tokyo mania. It celebrates old-style, hands-on craft.",Fresh
"The encoffination ritual has a subtlety and grace that's lacking in Takita's direction, which lays down the narrative with slow, heavy brushstrokes of lacquered whimsy.",Rotten
All three actors are skilled in communicating difficult emotions just with their faces and in bringing to life the gentle humor that leavens this very affecting movie about death and letting go.,Fresh
"In ""Departures, life and death are two expressive movements of one musical"" piece. Neither is taken as a polar opposite of the other; they dance rhythmically, like the ebb and flow of the ocean tide.",Fresh
"A charming, winning piece of filmmaking that, while in no way deserving of the title of Best Foreign Language film of this or any year, is a heartwarming and bittersweet tale that hits all the right notes.",Fresh
"Hampered by pacing that borders on glacial, the performances infuse the story with lingering melancholy.",Fresh
"Naturalistic performances, long takes, unfussy edits and a story that unfolds over a few hours are all present and correct.",Fresh
Small but sharp and extremely well observed.,Fresh
An impressive chamber piece by a director who needs watching.,Fresh
"This is a tough, shrewd, intelligent movie.",Fresh
"This is superior film-making, equally comfortable with the light (Boogie's obvious delight in his nipper and the realistic family dynamic) to the dark (his risibly macho deceipt with a jolly hooker).",Fresh
"It may not scale the heights of the best recent Romanian films (4 Months, 3 Weeks & 2 Days, The Death Of Mr Lazarescu) but Boogie is still a bittersweet character study.",Fresh
"The film remains dour, truthful, grimly droll.",Fresh
"Superbly acted, sharply observed and impressively directed Romanian drama, though it drags a little in the early stages.",Fresh
"Three 30-somethings relive their gloriously lurid college days for one night only in Radu Muntean's Boogie, a restrained and honest look at the male midlife crisis in an embryonic state.",Fresh
"Watching these women perform is a striking lesson in ballet's rigorous aesthetic alchemy -- and the extreme, exquisite individualism that prevails.",Fresh
Ballerina has the feel of a propaganda puff piece put out by the Russian tourist board.,Rotten
"A close-up but still, one senses, heavily idealized documentary portrait.",Rotten
"Skillfully written and entertaining documentary that is also a clever investigation into the professional lives of the world's best dancers, the ballerinas of Russia's Kirov Ballet.",Fresh
"That something so beautiful can exist in this modern world is, itself, a source of wonder.",Fresh
"Ballerina will be of interest mostly to balletomanes, but even folks who don't know their right foot from their left will find inspiration in the lives of these devoted dancers. Besides, who isn't moved by Swan Lake?",Fresh
"If only a glimpse, the privilege compensates: one wants more from Ballerina because the world it reveals -- elegant and harsh, glamorous and grinding, classical and obsolete -- proves so rich in exquisite contradictions.",Fresh
A refreshing and illuminating portrait of five new stars in Russian ballet.,Fresh
Ballet lovers will enjoy the footage of the young ballerinas taking command of their respective performances.,Fresh
"Mildly compelling and somewhat fascinating, but often tedious, incomplete and lacking enough insight about what it's truly like to be a ballerina.",Rotten
"Such a brief glimpse into these women's lives and art whets the appetite for more; alas, Ballerina ends far too quickly, leaving only their willowy shadows behind.",Fresh
"Anyone who knows about ballet will find much to recognize in the lives of these young women, but for those who do not, the film will be a revelation.",Fresh
"Not as perceptive as Etoiles or as ... entertaining as Ballets Russes, [but] still a glimpse into a priviledged, ruthlessly demanding world few outsiders ever get to see.",Fresh
Even those skeptical of ballet will likely be entranced.,Fresh
"...Ballerina looks behind the scenes ...to offer a closer look at the system of selection, training and rehearsal which keeps Russian ballet the envy of the world.",Fresh
"It's too levelheaded, too aesthetically old-fashioned and academic.",Rotten
A jewel of a documentary.,Fresh
"While the mysterious air of the ballerina is preserved, a chance to reveal the real people behind the iconic, ethereal image is squandered.",Rotten
"... in its simplistic, by-the-book delivery, Ballerina does give an inkling of the blood and sweat hidden underneath the ethereal beauty of classical dance.",Fresh
The movie is an admirable look into the venerable St. Petersburg company and how dancers thrive or just survive in the physically challenging world of dance.,Fresh
"As dazzling as they can be in performance, the ballerinas are even more breathtaking when a camera catches them alone in the shadows, dancing only for themselves.",Fresh
"Dance aficionados will be sent over the moon by this compelling documentary from director Bertrand Norman, chronicling what it takes to be a prima ballerina in the Mariinski Theatre.",Fresh
"This rare, behind-the-scenes dance film, which is more a profile of dancers than of the dance, shows that Russia and its famed Kirow are still the world's core of ballet.",Fresh
Behind-the-curtains has never been more ravishing nor more rewarding,Fresh
It's not quite nutty enough to be a guilty pleasure.,Rotten
"It's creaky, predictable and frequently idiotic. But for a tipsy Saturday night, this should tick all the right boxes.",Fresh
"Not only bad in predictable ways, it's obscenely lazy.",Rotten
A cheerfully terrible January time-waster.,Rotten
This is how 'Monty Python and the Holy Grail' would have turned out if it had been funny unintentionally instead of intentionally.,Rotten
A 14th-century road movie with 21st-century cuss words.,Rotten
Great song. Bad movie.,Rotten
"Stop me if you've heard this one. A priest, an altar boy, two Crusaders, and a con artist walk toward an abbey with a suspected witch in tow.",Rotten
The first reveal of Nicolas Cage sporting a blond wig with ringlets that makes him look like a Shirley Temple drag queen impersonator after a post-medieval-party-themed blackout is the sort of fright probably not intended by its makers.,Rotten
"Season of the Witch isn't quite Jonah Hex or Little Fockers bad, but it's one helluva shoddy way to start off the year in movies and yet another crummy entry in Nicolas Cage's woeful post-Oscar filmography.",Rotten
"A CGI freakout at the finale can't save this mundane medieval thriller about witches, devils and disillusioned knights.",Rotten
Season of the Witch is a fine example of a film that would've been great fun if only its creators had a sense of humor about the wild brew of absurdity they had percolating.,Rotten
"While 'Witch' might not be the worst thing I see this year, it's apparently been riddled with its own case of the Black Plague since day one. Every inch of the movie is infected with bad decisions that spread throughout each and every frame.",Rotten
Welcome to the January dead zone.,Rotten
"Directed by the perennially hollow Dominic Sena from a script by Bragi Schut, ""Season of the Witch"" is all seams. It never balances out its competing desires...",Rotten
"A mediocre knights-and-witchcraft B-movie that's somewhat cheesy, somewhat intriguing, and ultimately just not all that involving.",Rotten
"The stench of plague is all around, unless that's an aroma emanating from the script.",Rotten
"It's entertaining in a cheerfully ridiculous way, though Cage fans will be disappointed that he does not really lose his rag, despite some serious provocation from the Lord of Darkness.",Rotten
"It's part fairy tale-gone-wrong, part recycled legend, part panto horror. Think The Wolfman, or Van Helsing, only worse.",Rotten
Think of it as a modern Iranian adultery trial as imagined in 14th Century Europe by a terminally silly dreamer.,Rotten
Lacking any sort of energy and the weak premise at its core means there's very little anyone or anything could have been done to salvage it.,Rotten
"Not nearly funny or weird enough to see with friends after a few drinks, and despite impressive locations doesn't have enough visual appeal to simply watch on mute.",Rotten
"Cage plods through the story with a stiffly restrained, exaggeratedly earnest performance that makes him look like the most awkward amateur in the local Society For Creative Anachronism troupe.",Rotten
"If you can sit through an Uwe Boll movie, and be genuinely entertained; then run, don't walk, to see Season of the Witch.",Rotten
"Did either Cage or Sena even bother reading Bragi F. Schut's patchwork script, before adjusting the wig, flicking on the camera and cashing the pay cheques?",Rotten
"There are almost no laughs to be had in Season of the Witch. That's unfortunate, because the only chance that this overproduced yet still shoddy piece of early-January multiplex fodder had of being entertaining was as an unintentional comedy classic.",Rotten
"Season of the Witch begins in a Crusade taking place after the Crusades, in a 14th Century for Dummies about as immersive and real as the Ohio State Renaissance Festival.",Rotten
"It takes place during the 14th century, but everyone speaks in contemporary language, which might have been acceptable if the dialogue were clever or intelligent or funny or, you know, good.",Rotten
"It's The Crucible, except with real magic creatures, copious Cage bon mots, and the incomparably ridiculous sight of Perlman head-butting Beelzebub.",Rotten
Does to the medieval era what Cage's Wicker Man did to Anthony Shaffer.,Rotten
"You've probably never heard of first time screenwriter Bragi F Schut. And, after wading through this 14th century swords-and-witches hokum you'll probably never want to see his name again.",Rotten
"Despite some terrific locations in Hungary and the Austrian Alps, this ho-hum 14th-century history lesson remains routine and unconvincing right up to its all-hell-breaks-loose CGI-heavy finale.",Rotten
"Disappointing, sluggishly directed medieval thriller with poor special effects, a plot that manages to be both dull and nonsensical and not even a bonkers performance from Cage to liven things up.",Rotten
"Off the top of my head, I'm guessing that ""Season of the Witch"" claims a place in the top five all-time bizarre and pointless homages to art cinema.",Rotten
It's The Seventh Seal meets Get Him to the Greek meets Lord of the Rings as if filtered through Uwe Boll's hack-tastic brain.,Rotten
Even an actor like Nicolas Cage cannot elevate such a disappointingly anachronistic and incoherent religious epos.,Rotten
"You'll want to spend lots of time checking out those costumes, because, Perlman and Lee aside, there's not much to watch in the acting department.",Rotten
"If it's January, it must be time for another Nicolas Cage film",Rotten
"Because this is the first release of 2011, it would too be easy to crown ""Season of the Witch"" the worst film of the year, but I'm sure it will live up to that title for weeks to come.",Rotten
"I couldn't shake the feeling that it might have been conceived and filmed as a comedy, then edited so that it plays like a thriller.",Rotten
more like a troubled nap than a compelling flick,Rotten
Dull: the last thing a freakin' period-piece action-adventure occult thriller should be.,Rotten
"Cage alternates between leaden line readings and thunderous outbursts, making his accomplished costars Ulrich Thomsen and Stephen Campbell Moore look even better. But the movie's worst aspect is the CGI, which packs no scares whatsoever.",Rotten
"As the stakes rise, time for buddy-comedy drops; the jolts are too minor to register, the action mostly unimpressive.",Rotten
Even the most dedicated of Nicolas Cage's fans will find little to enjoy about the historical-fantasy-action romp Season of the Witch.,Rotten
Another movie is turned into a turkey.,Rotten
"The film is not altogether dreadful, although it's far from good. And that's not good. Classic stinkeroos are rarer than masterpieces, and we all need a laugh now and then, even if the laughs are inadvertent.",Rotten
"Just wait for the viral video highlights, coming soon to a computer screen near you.",Rotten
The screenplay is like a transcription of a Dungeons and Dragons session... The 'performances' are like clueless imitations of Monty Python by actors who don't understand comedy.,Rotten
"Season of the Witch is as bloodless as a starved vampire. Instead of a review, it deserves a stake in the heart.",Rotten
"It'll come as little surprise to anyone who follows Cage's career that he's picked yet another dud. Yes, after Knowing, Bangkok Dangerous, G-Force and Next, the follically-challenged actor has done it again.",Rotten
"Not a good film by any stretch of the imagination, but far from Cage's worst.",Rotten
"Is ""Felson"" not a moniker more appropriate to a sitcom second banana than a fierce warrior?",Rotten
This isn't a documentary about Christine O'Donnell's recent Senate campaign in Delaware. That would be a lot more entertaining...It may remind you of the movies of Uwe Boll.,Rotten
"Audiences considering ""Season of the Witch"" should heed the timeless advice of its ancestor ""Holy Grail"" -- run away!",Rotten
Good production values almost rescue this overwrought medieval tale.,Rotten
"Rather than elevating this wanna-be Hammer horror flick, Cage somehow lowers its quality.",Rotten
"A mishmash of horror and history genres that's not as bad as its trailers but ultimately is dragged down by, of all things, its star.",Rotten
"A middle-of-the-road bore, with only occasional flashes of the fun that could have been had the whole way through.",Rotten
"Really, at its worst, the whole thing's a little bit like ""Monty Python and the Holy Grail"" - - the jokes.",Rotten
"The scariest thing about Season of the Witch is the movie itself, an abomination of bad filmmaking and terrible acting.",Rotten
"Ever since Bergman's ""The Virgin Spring"" was remade as ""Last House on the Left,"" his work has suggested a rich mine for homage.",Rotten
"It's got videogame-from-hell F/X, + jousting, + Cage in tangled long hair he seems to have mistakenly put in the washing machine.",Rotten
"Cage's old pal Dominic Sena is a decade removed from their ""Gone in 60 Seconds"" directing glory, and he gets nothing out of this script that isn't pure hokum.",Rotten
It is a hopeless mish-mash that feels like they were making it up as they went along. It's also dull.,Rotten
"Unchallenged and over-wigged, Cage is merely biding his time with this serving of horror hooey, obviously more interested in hearing the sweet sound of ""cut!"" than trying to make a tepid screenplay shuffle.",Rotten
P.T. Barnum and H.L. Mencken remain inarguably correct in their assessment of the public's gullibility and appetite.,Rotten
Worst. D&D session. Ever.,Rotten
[VIDEO] This movie sucks so awfully that you'd think it was a vicious prank.,Rotten
"It will probably be the worst reviewed movie of the year, it may break up couples mid-date night, and fraternities are sure to use it in tandem with contraband beverage Four Loko for Hell Week hazing. But come on, it's not that bad.",Fresh
"Authenticity takes a back seat. Swordfights, wolf-punching and zombie monks clamber into the front seat and smash a hole through the windscreen.",Fresh
"You've seen more convincing medieval performances from guys at Ye Olde Pancake House after a LARP scrimmage. With all the dead birds and fish, this might seem like a timely piece of apocalyptic fiction. But such pestilence is annual par for Nicolas Cage.",Rotten
We need a serious suspension of disbelief to accept these two aging actors as faultless warriors in tip-top shape.,Rotten
"Disregards characters, emotions and even dramatic tension in favour of an endless parade of 'cool shit' to impress its perceived audience of 13 year olds.",Rotten
"'Season of the Witch' entertains, but don't get me wrong, it's a bad movie.",Rotten
This is the puffy-faced Nic Cage. The one who fights for Christ and Little Debbies and not necessarily in that order.,Rotten
The only time I was even modestly entertained was when the 10-year-old boy sitting behind me (obviously taken out of school to see the film by his model parents) started belching unrelentingly at the screen.,Rotten
Makes The Last Airbender look like Avatar.,Rotten
"Did they really say ""I've saved your ass"" in medieval Europe?",Rotten
"While certainly no Witchfinder General, it doesn't deserve to be burned at the stake.",Fresh
Season of the Witch suffers from a general laziness.,Rotten
How many mediocre movies can Nicolas Cage make and still have a career? I guess we will wait and see.,Rotten
"A cursed abomination...as a priest observes, 'We're going to need more holy water!'",Rotten
Director Dominic Sena is more like a less amusing Uwe Boll than Ingmar Bergman.,Rotten
Dominic Sena directs all this stuff and nonsense with a paucity of fun unbecoming a loopy tale of medieval witches starring Nicolas Cage and Ron Perlman.,Rotten
Cage is effective as a falling down drunk in Las Vegas or a treasure hunter navigating goofy road trips but not as a disillusioned champion of the Church going one-on-one with a demon. Steven Seagal would have been more believable.,Rotten
Poor plot twists and CGI-heavy action further muddle what might have been an intriguing story of fanaticism and superstition.,Rotten
"It's Centurion Deux without the second-coming-of-Carpenter pretense, though you still wish the trashiness were more distinctive.",Rotten
Begins with a bang (a hanged witch rises from a watery grave to dispatch her tormenter) but ends with a thud (a bungled exorcism releases a silly-looking computer-animated demon).,Rotten
This painfully earnest and overblown medieval swords-and-sorcery road movie is unlikely to warm the cockles of any but the most die-hard fans of Cage's stentorian growl and arch overacting.,Rotten
Nicolas Cage=Modern Day Bela Lugosi in Declining Years,Rotten
Witch's Spell only Partially Effective,Rotten
"From script to editing, this Witch doesn't float.",Rotten
Spellbinding it's not.,Rotten
"Watching it you can't escape the feeling that Hollywood executives were constantly hovering telling Sena to add more CGI here, less character development there and all-in-all doing their best to royally screw things up.",Rotten
Avoid it -- wait for it -- like the Black Plague.,Rotten
It's a bit cheesy but there is action and tension and strong graphic effects - and even a deadpan moment,Fresh
"Just how big was that IRS bill, anyway?",Fresh
It's amazing how little entertainment value there is in watching Nicolas Cage and Ron Perlman play world-weary Crusaders in a movie called Season Of The Witch. Come on! It's Ghost Rider and Hellboy!,Rotten
"For long, long stretches, [it's] too leaden and dour to be any fun at all.",Rotten
Director Dominic Sena sets a quick pace; the dull moments are brightened by the unexpectedly likable team of Cage and Perlman.,Fresh
"Seriously, don't you always think that the powerful demon or witch or whatever could really just zap the humans immediately and go have lunch?",Rotten
"Anti-Oscar-movie people, this one is for you.",Rotten
"Guns are fun in movies, but bashing about with broadswords speaks to the 12-year-old in all of us.",Fresh
God's teeth!,Rotten
Cage's disappointingly subdued performance stands as the proverbial straw that broke the camel's back...,Rotten
"Although I will likely be disemboweled from my toes to my nose (metaphorically speaking only, I hope) for this proclamation, I didn't think Season of the Witch was all that bad!*",Rotten
"I may be in the minority of critics to think so, but Season Of The Witch is an enjoyable medieval thriller that's well-made in spite of some moments of silliness.",Fresh
Have low expectations for this movie and you might just be surprised.,Fresh
It's an Uwe Boll kind of film that's been directed with a certain degree of competency by previous Cage collaborator Dominic Sena.,Fresh
Another forgettable trifle from Cage.,Rotten
"After a while, the movie tires of the witch business and trots out a plot twist that permits the effects department to spend money.",Rotten
"Not the stinker that everyone says it is, but you do have to ignore its flaws in order to be entertained.",Rotten
"The filmmakers try to use special effects to cover up the weaknesses of the story, but even on that point they fail pretty badly.",Rotten
"Cage merely stands around looking glum, letting his hair extensions do the acting for him.",Rotten
"The anticlimactic scenes all lead up to an inevitable CGI-heavy showdown: Good vs. Evil, featuring a clan of grotesque zombie monks and a winged demon as realistic as the one Eddie Murphy jacks up in The Golden Child.",Rotten
"It could have been a campy, but interesting fantasy adventure...Instead, it's just boring and tedious. Someone obviously rolled a 1 on their d20.",Rotten
"Season of the Witch is ridiculous in every way. But it's as ridiculous as any ironic fan of Nicolas Cage or hammy, ""swords 'n' spells"" nonsense could ever wish it to be.",Fresh
"More than a little silly, but it does have decent-enough entertainment value for its target audience. You'll know if you're in that audience.",Fresh
"Mis-marketed as an epic, 14th century adventure, this is one of the funniest, most ridiculous movies in a long time. ""Season"" borders on slapstick, and even more moments when you fully expect the entire cast of ""Monty Python"" poke around a corner.",Fresh
"This is not a good film, not in the least.",Rotten
The best thing that can be said about Season of the Witch is that this season ends in 98 minutes and I never have to live through it again.,Rotten
A decently twisty indie thriller about hostages lured aboard an airport minivan whose destination is nowhere pleasant.,Fresh

"If you step aboard Shuttle, be prepared for one heck of a ride filled with suspense, action and ever-escalating terror. With this ingenious thriller, Edward Anderson, who wrote the heist flick Flawless, makes an audacious directorial debut.",Fresh
"Anderson focuses entirely on cat-and-mouse capers, while failing to reflect in any serious way upon the real-world issues that his plot exploits, so the end result is a disappointingly empty exercise in genre.",Rotten
a pile of stinking turpitude,Rotten
One hell of a terrifying ride ...,Fresh
"Shuttle mostly exists, in the words of Alfred Hitchcock, to 'put the audience through it,' but it leaves you in a very different place than where it started and with remarkable economy of effort.",Fresh
"Instead of suspense, we get frustration at the stupidity of the characters.",Rotten
Shuttle is a grim and twisted exercise in high-stress terror that falls just short of the torture-porn subgenre.,Fresh
"A slightly prosaic and tedious, but mostly chilly and intense ride.",Fresh
Shuttle could have worked but it is so bogged down with clich√©s and predictable twists that it comes apart at its illogical seams.,Rotten
"When the payoff finally arrives, it seems tasteless not just because of its topicality, but because the shock feels unearned.",Rotten
"There is no release for the audience, no 'entertainment,' not even much action excitement. Just a remorseless march into the dark.",Rotten
"Well conceived thriller, Shuttle takes the familiar situation and develops it into terrifying ordeal",Fresh
"The characters are aggressive and mostly smart, the villain is fearsome and hateful, and the premise ('An airport shuttle ride descends into darkness') is brilliantly simple.",Fresh
Hop aboard this Shuttle if you're in the mood for one unsettling ride.,Fresh
Immediate frights and long-lasting dread are still not quite enough,Rotten
"Boasts a killer premise and better than average acting, so it's all the more disappointing that Anderson proves unable to avoid annoying horror movie pitfalls.",Rotten
This Playboy fantasy farce is one of those painful comedies in which the strain to be funny shows -- always.,Rotten
Moore is so offensive to all the senses that you spend all ninety minutes of the movie intensely wishing to punch him in the face.,Rotten
"The best mainstream comedy so far this year. Every time you start thinking how you've seen it all before, you find yourself laughing too hard to care.",Fresh
...amusing for those 18-to-24 and male but will likely be offensive to many not part of that demographic.,Rotten
A smarmy premise becomes an unspeakably offensive movie in a mess that is not just disgusting but dull. I don't need a bath after seeing it; I need an exorcism.,Rotten
"When it comes time to wheel Hefner out for his cameo, even he seems irritated by these guys.",Rotten
uses its R rating as perhaps an eight-year-old would: to drop the F-bomb constantly and to show poop.,Rotten

"March gets the mean-to-funny ratio wrong; it's misanthropic, smutty, and smug, but with a few notable [Craig] Robinson-engineered exceptions, never even remotely chuckle-inducing.",Rotten
"Been there, gagged at that.",Rotten
The first post-coma diarrhea joke was cringe-worthy. The third post-coma diarrhea joke was merely nauseating.,Rotten
"Without a Friedberg/Seltzer offering this year (fingers crossed), I can wholeheartedly declare Miss March as the worst film of 2009.",Rotten
"The whole movie feels like these guys watched some other movie 100 times and thought they could do the same thing. So in their head, this is ... hilarious, but not to anyone else.",Rotten
A witless hodgepodge of gross-out gags that by comparison makes last summer's 'The House Bunny' look like 'Citizen Kane'.,Rotten
"written and directed by Cregger and Moore... they can definitely do short-form sketch comedy, but their handle on the 90-minute movie has a bit to be desired",Rotten

"Miss March is, to use the vernacular of the escapist moviegoer, the biggest pile of crap I've seen in ages.",Rotten
"When the movie was going to come out a month ago, it was called Miss February. Then the release date changed, and so did the title. Now it's Miss March. Miss This would have been more helpful.",Rotten
"My blood runs cold at the memory of Miss March, a 90-minute rip-off of the J. Geils Band song Centerfold whose multi-hyphenate creators prove themselves actor-director-writer-failures.",Rotten
The funniest thing about the monumentally stupid anti-comedy Miss March is that somehow the producers convinced Playboy to sign off on the thing.,Rotten
"If there's a target audience for Miss March, we suspect it would involve people aged around 14, who are male and perhaps stoned. All others: You were warned.",Rotten
The showpiece gags range from the stale to the grotesque.,Rotten
Even Craig Robinson can't quite redeem this messy raunchfest.,Rotten
The month is irrelevant; Miss March would be a dog no matter where it fell on the calendar.,Rotten
"Cregger and Moore not only star in ""Miss March,"" they wrote and directed it too, which seems like a selfless act akin to throwing yourself on a live grenade, protecting any innocent careers around you from getting hit by flying shrapnel.",Rotten
"As an example of Hollywood's utter disdain for women, particularly in movies aimed at young men, Miss March hits a new low...",Rotten
"They've got enough solid material for a half-hour sitcom, including two great, oh-so-politically incorrect lines worthy of integrating into the annals of pop culture, but that does not a feature film make.",Rotten
"Gross-out comedy starring two members of The Whitest Kids U'Know is one of the Worst Movies U'll See. Two buddies take a road trip to the Playboy mansion, defecating all the way. How apropos, since the movie is crap.",Rotten
"The movie operates mainly on a crippling fear of human sexuality, female sexuality, females in general, black people, lesbians and just about everything else.",Rotten
A pathetic excuse for a comedy [that's] actually ... a feature-length effort to reposition Playboy's brand of squeaky-clean titillation as relevant to young men weaned on internet porn.,Rotten
Every once in a while a movie comes around that most critics hate and I love. Well here is a movie that I thought was completely hilarious.,Fresh
So awful as to make heterosexual men actively loathe Playboy.,Rotten
The problem with Miss March is that it isn't very funny.,Rotten
"Overall a raggedy, unfocused affair that wastes both directors' acting talent and feels like too much work between the laughs.",Rotten
Miss March caters so heavily to its juvenile audience it forgets the actual humans who should have been at the center of the story.,Rotten
"The whole thing left me bored, and if I'd have remembered to wear a watch I'm sure I'd have looked at it a half dozen times waiting for the torture to end.",Rotten
"Occasionally genuinely funny in its simple-minded outrageousness, but more often simply lame.",Rotten
We're the country that gave the world jazz and abstract expressionism and Orson Welles. We invented basketball and hip-hop. Now we export adolescent comedy garbage and hope the world won't notice.,Rotten
The movie starts by letting you know that no low-brow subject is off limits. But then there are long stretches of nothing in between the gross-out gags.,Rotten
A relentlessly insulting and offensive flick which endeavors to redeem itself via 11th-hour moralizing ony after every frame up to the end had been a wholesale celebration of the debasement of females and the stereotyping of blacks.,Rotten
"The writing and directing team of Trevor Moore and Zach Cregger (television's ""The Whitest Kids U Know"") take a failing grade on their entree into feature film territory.",Rotten
Amusing and tired in roughly equal measure.,Rotten
Parental Content Review,Rotten
"Notable to its wheelhouse-demographic, in that it disproves the notion that every possible mangled male genital sight-gag has already been shown on screen.",Rotten
Forget waterboarding -- just show Guantanamo detainees Miss March and they'll say anything.,Rotten
"Forget March, this one misses by a mile.",Rotten
"Anyone who goes to see Miss March hoping for a voyeuristic, '80-flavored T&A smutfest will be sorely disappointed.",Rotten
"The movie's aiming for the drunken college crowd but most of the gags have the nervous, giggly idiocy of two middle-school kids flipping through dad's Playboy.",Rotten
I know it's early but this one is already a prime contender for worst movie of the year,Rotten
"Too much of the film consists of predictable, thin banter between archetypal characters designed without enough innovation.",Rotten
Millions of brain cells committed suicide last Friday when exposed to Miss March.,Rotten

"Cregger and Moore...are a pair of genuine triple-threats: They can't write, they can't direct, and they're not funny.",Rotten
Here's a movie that isn't fit to debut on the big screen.,Rotten
Miss March does not have much to offer aside from nudity and sexist humor.,Rotten
A disaster on every level.,Rotten
"The boys directed and co-scripted, so there's no one else to blame.",Rotten
It's a strange irony that any movie aimed squarely at an allegedly adult audience usually features enough gags involving feces and urine to delight six-year-olds for hours.,Rotten
Shockingly second-rate and relentlessly unfunny...,Rotten
"Abysmal, laugh-free and frequently offensive comedy whose one or two original ideas are completely overshadowed by smutty, puerile gags and a plot that's so insultingly sexist that you wonder if it's part of an elaborate prank.",Rotten
"A crude, crass, virtually laugh-free sex comedy.",Rotten
"If this film were as racist as it is sexist (which it very nearly is), it would be a buddy movie about the madcap antics of two Klan members on a lynching spree. Appalling. If we could give it zero out of five, we would.",Rotten
Miss March must be a contender for worst film of the year. It's so poor that you begin to suspect it's a pastiche.,Rotten
"A whiff of what I can only describe as pure evil billows off the screen while this comedy is playing: a buddy grossout picture with zero laughs and a persistent, chilling misogyny.",Rotten
"An almost perfect atrocity. It is a towering K2 of bobbins... the most mangy, noxious, charmless, sexist, racist, unfunny, infantile, stomach-turning, grotesque, clueless, inept and stupid film of the year.",Rotten
Nothing works. Nothing comes close to working. Even other people's ideas that work in their own films don't work here.,Rotten
"Pure eye-poking, boob-baring raunch that will tickle your inner idiot and wind up everyone else something rotten.",Fresh
A teen sex comedy that isn't sexy or comic - talk about dumb and dumber...,Rotten
Cregger is so dull that it might be an improvement if he slipped back into a coma.,Rotten
So moronic that even plankton would tut at its ignorance.,Rotten
A dire gross-out comedy that tackles many of the same themes as Adventureland but without an ounce of subtlety or wit.,Rotten
"This ""comedy"" might be the Worst Movie Ever Seen, even with the aftershock of the Wayans Bros' Dance Flick still lingering.",Rotten
"You'd have to be drunk, 12 years old or witless really want to see this. Hopefully not all three.",Rotten
"Some of the lewdest, unfunniest jokes ever made, and at the end one feels in need of a stiff drink, a hot shower and a lesson in selective amnesia.",Rotten
"At its best, this lewder, cruder spin on last year's ""Sex Drive"" has a disarmingly daffy shaggy-dog touch a la ""Half-Baked"" or ""The Brothers Solomon."" But by the time a woman enjoys champagne spiked with dog urine, ""Miss March"" is all turn-offs.",Rotten
The movie's over-use of poop and pee is further evidence of its desperation.,Rotten
Definitely worth seeing if you like a good gross-out film/ sex comedy.,Fresh
The central relationship remains intriguing but the later parts of the film suffer from a routine conspiracy plot.,Rotten
The relationship of a 13-year-old innocent with a sophisticated 30-something woman is credible: not so much the political conspiracy.,Fresh
"The immersion of a titillating, gender-altered Lolita story into the political framework of 1963 strikes a chord of wanton misuse of dramatic license.",Rotten
"A dash of Ingmar Bergman and Oliver Stone in this Capitol Hill noir, as kinky DC sexual politics collide with flaky JFK conspiracy theories, and Bay of Pigs CIA boozer masterminds wonder if communists are having more fun.",Fresh
"An unholy genre mutation undreamt of on the isle of Dr. Moreau, An American Affair piggybacks the pubescent sexual awakening sapfest onto the JFK assassination conspiracy thriller.",Rotten
The reason to see An American Affair is Gretchen Mol.,Fresh
"Only Noah Wyle, as Adam's unreadable dad, rises above the muck; he deserves his Tarantino-aided resurrection sooner rather than later.",Rotten
A clich-ridden hodgepodge of film genres.,Rotten
"If you can get past the exploitation-of-minors thing, there's a tawdry exuberance to moments like the one in which the twerp and his overage girlfriend drunkenly splash paint on each other.",Rotten
"Sketchily written, clumsily directed and poorly acted, even history-conspiracy aficionados will be left cold.",Rotten
"Did Metcalf spend a weekend watching ""Summer of '42"" and ""JFK"" and decide they'd make a good mash-up?",Rotten
"A flick for Kennedy assassination conspiracy buffs which puts a whole new spin on ""the grassy knoll"" courtesy of the flamboyance of a nearly-naked Gretchen Mol.",Fresh
Here's the best thing I can say: that it refrains from having its 13-year-old protagonist have sex with Gretchen Mol.,Rotten
The most compelling moment comes from archival footage.,Rotten
"It's all presented so earnestly... that you barely realize at the time how preposterous it all is. Intrigue! Cubans! The Bay of Pigs! JFK! It's the coming-of-age tale filtered through the mind of Oliver Stone,",Rotten
"This is not, by any reasonable definition of the term, a professional film, even though several experienced and established actors have been inveigled to inhabit it",Rotten
"It's a good rule of thumb that any film that grandly puts ""American"" in its title is going to try to make some statements way beyond its pay grade.",Rotten
Even Oliver Stone would giggle.,Rotten
"Gretchen Mol, lounging semi-nude as she smokes near an open Georgetown window, would spark any young man's curiosity and recklessness. But the assassination story line is absurd.",Rotten
An implausible drama about some Washington D.C. people plotting around the time of the assassination of JFK.,Rotten
"A captivating, witty and poignant drama. Gretchen Mol sizzles.",Fresh
"JFK meets Notes on a Scandal meets Rear Window? An American Affair has some promise and potential, but its main ideas remain messy and undeveloped.",Rotten
"Subscribes wholeheartedly to the history-as-pornography school of thinking, in which all will be revealed if you can figure out who is sleeping with whom, when and where and what they do in bed.",Rotten
"The Cuban Missile Crisis is a year passed and the assassination is looming, and yet Adam's pubescent crises are given Wagnerian emphasis.",Rotten
"Even the famous M Street stairs from ""The Exorcist"" are out of place in the climax of this lightweight movie.",Rotten
Painfully contrived,Rotten
"Start to finish, [the film] makes absolutely no sense.",Rotten
Turns out An American Affair needed more than a name change to save itself from embarrassment.,Rotten
"There are scenes that work here and there, but regrettably not nearly enough to hold the film together. In the end, this affair is definitely not one to remember.",Rotten
"Before An American Affair is over, you can be sure that Adam will learn a very familiar life lesson.",Rotten
"The title sums up the bland, unimaginative and cliche-laden thriller/coming-of-age tale.",Rotten
"An earnest, fictional coming-of-age story is squeezed from a bitter, true-life local tragedy. And it works.",Fresh
"Out of its mind at a deep, essential level, An American Affair plays its dubious scenario with a straight face that makes the silly thing quite watchable.",Rotten
so absurd and convoluted that even JFK's legacy can't subdue its preposterousness,Rotten
"gets in its own way by not knowing what kind of story it's telling, and by not knowing whose story it's telling",Rotten
"Covers the three essential bases of indie horror: It's scary, it's smart, and it pushes a few boundaries. An excellent debut for Paul Solet.",Fresh
"Little details like these make the film a valuable contribution to the genre. Likewise, the treatment of female characters and themes, while not perfect, is welcome.",Fresh
"Along with Solet's direction and Ladd's admirable conveyance of isolation and paranoia, tonally Grace feels like something an indie Bergman or Polanski might have done.",Fresh
"Like Bug or Audition, Grace will imprint its uniquely grotesque imagery onto your cerebrum, then dare you to shake it off.",Fresh
"Profoundly disturbing, a chilling motion picture that shows an invigorating amount of imagination and wicked behavior, immediately vaulting it above most horror product.",Fresh
Grace is very much the antidote to what plagues most of the horror genre today. It will restore your faith that there is still an artistic vision within the horror genre.,Fresh
"The story a mother who must supply her vampire baby with appropriate nourishment is unemotional, unscary, and overly clinical.",Rotten
"There's a pervasive and unintentional Raimian sensibility to Grace, writer-director Paul Solet's feature debut, that thoroughly undermines its Polanskian underpinnings.",Rotten
"Creepy, yes, but what's the point of all of this bratty, poignance-free bloodletting?",Rotten
Solet proves himself adept both as a visual storyteller and as a guy who can make you crap your pants.,Fresh
Grace is a truly horrifying movie.,Fresh
Paul Solet's gyno-horror flick is certainly twisted but only slightly unnerving; the movie is about as gripping as one might expect given that its infant monster is both mute and cradle-bound.,Rotten
"Grimaces its way through 85 long, low-key minutes just to marvel again and again that, gosh, mommies really love their babies.",Rotten
"Lame horror entry about a woman who gives birth to a literal little monster won't scare up the bucks, in spite of post-fest hype.",Rotten
"Deeply unsettling stuff ... [but] sharp, witty and ambitiously artful too, like some lost gem from the highbrow spectrum of '70s exploitation cinema",Fresh
"""Grace"" isn't really a horror movie, but it's gruesome and unsettling. The story could easily have been turned into low-budget genre trash; but first-time feature director Paul Solet maintains iron control of the wild material. Clearly, this is a guy to k",Fresh
It's a horrifying meditation on the unbreakable union of mother and child.,Fresh
"The sickest and most disturbing movie you'll see this year, extremely effective on every level without cowtowing to the overused formulas that have become standard in modern horror.",Fresh
"Keeps you on the edge of your seat, or perhaps the edge of fleeing the theater.",Fresh
Introduces Grace writer/director Paul Solet as a new master of horror.,Fresh
A combination splatter flick and demon child extravaganza that succeeds in bloody special effects but fails to become an actual movie.,Rotten
"It is a true original, and unlike all those remakes and retreads this is one movie that truly knows what scares you.",Fresh
"It's hard to say who's the real monster here: Sure, the ghoulish Grace is some kind of vampire-zombie something ... but in Solet's movie (s)mother love comes in all shades of crazy.",Fresh
...a love-it-or-hate-it proposition...,Rotten
you may never look at a baby sound monitor the same way.,Fresh
"It focuses on characters rather than the color red, which is why it manages to surpass many of its more prominent cinematic competitors and qualify as one of the few true must-see horror movies of 2009.",Fresh
"Grace is just a stretched thin short film, as the mother-in-law with the unsettling maternal issues, the corrupt doctor, and the lesbian midwife material don't fit in.",Rotten
Solet's wicked slice of Suburban Gothic horror taps into some of humankind's most potent iconography and exploits that imagery mercilessly.,Fresh
Grace very well could be the movie you need to see to restore your faith in the idea that there is still an artistic vision within the horror genre.,Fresh
"Director Paul Solet's slow yet solid pacing wears on the nerves effectively, and Ladd's portrayal of innocence and steadfast denial push the film from great to exceptional - with the help of some really exquisite gore.",Fresh
"Unfortunately, Solet fails to end his movie in a satisfactory way, and that left me with a bad taste and a nagging feeling that the movie was a very bad joke.",Fresh
There's nothing in Endgame that's less than proficient.,Fresh
There is just too much information to absorb in one sitting.,Rotten
An inspirational tale chronicling the contributions of a few unseen players in the South African struggle for independence.,Fresh
"What sparks are felt throughout come largely from Hurt and Ejiofor, who both seem to understand exactly the type of talky, tentative movie they're in and do their best to bring in some glints of humor and uncertainty.",Rotten
"The principals, especially Ejiofor, rise above the starchiness that often hampers portrayals of recent, monumental history.",Fresh
"William Hurt and Chiwetel Ejiofor, impressive at opposite ends of the table as a government mouthpiece and a philosophy professor, provide all the fireworks the story needs.",Fresh
...crafts a crackling thriller out of the tangle of crafty maneuvering that ended apartheid.,Fresh
"This is an ambitious attempt to tell the story of World War I's most notorious fighter pilot. But while the events are truly momentous, with thrillingly rendered aerial combat, the film is let down by lacklustre writing and direction.",Rotten
"So while the earthbound sequences may drag, when 'The Red Baron' takes to the skies, it soars.",Fresh
A pretty successful European co-production strengthened by a charismatic title performance from Matthias Schweighfer.,Fresh
The Red Baron is like Le Grande Illusion remade by a German porn director. Never in the field of human film-making was so much money wasted on so little.,Rotten
"A very low-flying, sentimentalised account of the life of legendary first world war German air ace, Manfred Von Richthofen.",Rotten
"It's a stirring story - German-made but with English dialogue - well told, vividly illustrating a strange era when old-style Prussian nobility became the cavalry of the skies.",Fresh
"Looks terrific when up in the air amidst the dogfights, but falls flat back on the ground.",Rotten
The aerial dogfights are the best thing in the film but any time it returns to earth it does so with a bump amidst turgid drama and leaden dialogue.,Rotten
"The dogfights are competently handled, and Headey looks awfully sweet in her Boden version of 1917 mufti, but the stodgy comic-book dialogue keeps shooting plausibility down in flames.",Rotten
The Red Baron is impressively shot and has some great dogfight sequences but it's badly let down by a dull script and fails to engage on an emotional level.,Rotten
Nikolai Mllerschn's film about the German flying ace has nothing like the sort of flair it needs to get away with its sentimental departures from the historical facts.,Rotten
"Moderately expensive, immoderately dull.",Rotten
An ambitious young man in his flying machine,Fresh
Embraces embellishment and outright falsehood in search of soap opera.,Rotten
"His plane may be red, but the dialogue is purple.",Rotten
The propaganda films produced by both sides in the '30s and '40s might've been objectionable for many reasons but at least they had the good sense to show real planes in action.,Rotten
"If the film is intelligent and thoughtful, it is unfortunately lacking in energy and passion; it is more a somber, highly familiar reflection on warfare and its toll than an action movie.",Fresh
Drama about World War I flying aces never gets off the ground.,Rotten
Unfortunately Muellerschoen's movie emphasizes empty grandeur over human drama.,Rotten
"Red Baron leaves Manfred von Richthofen a lifeless clich of Aryan grandeur, stuck inside of a film that tries too hard to dazzle without fully exploring the possibilities of the legend.",Rotten
"Alas, this BARON is barren, more dead than red.",Rotten
"A stodgy but good-looking war film, with many stirring scenes of aerial combat.",Rotten
"One can see how its overtly soapy, lowest-common-denominator antics would play comfortably in various climes.",Rotten
A bleak adventure flick and a very sweaty psychological thriller.,Fresh
"Director Daniel Myrick has taken his excellent work from the ultra-low-budget ""Blair Witch Hunt,"" added some modest resources as befits that success and come up with a great little tale of suspense and horror.",Fresh
"Although the film has an undeniably strong, suspenseful tone -- not to mention symbolic resonance -- it doesn't rise above its overly familiar setup.",Rotten
"With a low-budget look, cliched dialogue, a stale plot and so-so acting, this supernatural thriller is unlikely to achieve the phenomenal success of its fabled predecessor.",Rotten
"Even with its uber-clichd last five minutes, The Objective may be one of the smartest horror movies this year.",Fresh
"Blair Witch's co-mastermind Myrick teams with co-screenwriter Wes Clark Jr., son of the retired general for, well, Blair Witch In Burkas. And extraterrestrial Afghans as villains or village idiots, take your pick. Close Encounters Of The Imperialist Kind.",Rotten
"Still, it's the shivers that count, and while Myrick may not make our spine tingle like he did back in the late '90s...The Objective is still an impressive piece of work",Fresh
"The film lags in four of five places, sometimes adding to the desolate mood and sometimes simply dragging.",Rotten
"Ten years on, it's hard to begrudge the director for trying to make a comeback by rehashing his prior formula, but perhaps he should have stuck even closer and handed the cameras to the actors again",Rotten
"[Director] Myrick does an admirable job of spinning tension from a group of guys mostly standing around, but too often the film's portentous tone seems more silly than suspenseful.",Rotten
"When the straggling survivors in The Objective learn they are expendable, they are also, much like the Nostromo crew, upset.",Rotten
...a passable yet rather tedious piece of work.,Rotten
"In this year's crop of Oscar-nominated shorts, the animated category beats the live-action offerings.",Fresh
Moore steals Happy Tears by underplaying -- in what may be the warmest performance of her career.,Rotten
"The story always feels edgily, sometimes jerkily, unpredictable before surprisingly opting for a conventional wrap.",Fresh
"Happy Tears is less of a mess than it looks like, despite its quirk-infested, baggy midsection.",Fresh
"Happy Tears, is simply weird. The funny has gone missing.",Rotten
"Lichtenstein dutifully unpacks the family's unhappy past, but he's so easily distracted by surreal dream sequences and colorful supporting characters that his main story gradually dries up into a sitcom.",Rotten
Succeeds only at suggesting the incompatibility of returning-home dramedy and surrealistic flights of fancy.,Rotten
"Other than the guest-starring appearance of Cy Twombly canvases, nothing distinguishes this poor relation of The Savages from all the other emotionally fraudulent Amerindies about familial dysfunction and reconciliation.",Rotten
I had better write my review as soon as possible because it's going to fade from memory pronto--it bearing such little resemblance to humanity as I know it.,Rotten
"Not even the reliable Posey can salvage this slag heap, and fans of the iconic Indiewood starlet -- Poseyphiles? Parkerheads? -- will be especially crestfallen.",Rotten
"A vulgar, happy-as-cancer aberration that takes the dysfunctional family idea to a new low. Whimsical, yes. Happy, never.",Rotten
An oddball family drama with idiosyncratic characters and a handful of surreal scenes.,Fresh
"If the plot unfolded in a less formulaic way, this could have been an impressive dark-tinged comedy. But in the end, it's more a case of talented actors trying to find something fresh in a fairly stale tale.",Rotten
Hollywood's strong female actors have in Lichtenstein a young talent who gives them the roles they deserve.,Fresh
"Happy Tears is a complete mess of a movie, but Lichtenstein conjures some sweet moments and striking metaphors -- and none more striking than Posey's $500 boots, which look either black or blue, given the available light.",Fresh
"What's worse, the super-tired plot or the pretentious daydream asides? Despite Demi Moore and Parker Posey, the only time I was happy was when I was leaving the theater.",Rotten
Realism falls victim to quirk yet again.,Rotten
"It works more often than it doesn't, but it never quite goes where you expect. And that's rare enough to be noteworthy.",Fresh
"Happy Tears settles for the usual moments, even at its quirkiest.",Rotten
"On its way to a climax that ends every plot strand on an unrealistically upbeat and pat note, Happy Tears loses sight of what made the film so engrossing in the first place.",Rotten
"In the role of a dialed-down, capable woman, Demi Moore suggests dramatic possibilities for future roles. She projects a kind of calm, and it's attractive.",Fresh
Sometimes dysfunctional families are better kept for personal consumption rather than being unleashed on the world at large.,Rotten
"A cringe-inducing, self-consciously kooky indie comedy that's best enjoyed for its taste of Rip Torn, who, judging by his recent alleged bank break-in, comes to loose-cannon stuff naturally.",Rotten
Writer and director Mitchell Lichtenstein struggles to find the humor in a host of horrors.,Rotten
"Not all of the subplots work, but with its flights of fancy, strong acting and a cockeyed skew of family dysfunction, Happy Tears most certainly tries.",Rotten
You don't necessarily believe these are real folks but boy they sure are entertaining.,Fresh
Reminds one of how bad American independent films...can be.,Rotten
one of those awkwardly pretentious attempts to seem hip and profound by simply depicting people acting really goofy,Rotten
"It's rarely dull and confidently guided by the cast, but it offers little in the way of overall impact, despite creative visual flourishes and a screenplay rooted in the devastating game of personal reflection. It's cold to the touch.",Rotten
"Demi Moore and Parker Posey play polar-opposite sisters dealing with their aging father (Rip Torn) who's showing signs of senility, soiling himself and shacking up with his ""nurse"" (Ellen Barkin).",Rotten
Overwrought comedy.,Rotten
"A drab, pale-looking affair without a trace of visual style, this cross-country pursuit yarn fights a losing battle to sustain viewer attention via narrative alone, so much does it flounder for lack of imagistic flair.",Rotten
"The film's second half appears primed to tread some interesting existential territory, but Buschel seems confused about what direction he means to take his material.",Rotten
"All of which is well and artsy, but doesn't diminish the sense, once the mystery has untangled, that the film has been gesturing toward a profundity that isn't there.",Rotten
"Not the most riveting of noir dramas, this film exists mainly to project the talents of Michael Shannon in the role of a drunk private eye.",Fresh
"Though Ryan Samul's textured cinematography makes the stubble and shadows seem nearly 3-D, the story chokes on a dull twist from Rosow's past.",Fresh
"Shannon's performance takes The Missing Person as far as it goes, but when a real-world tragedy commandeers the story, Buschel's thin pastiche falls to pieces.",Rotten
neither the existential 70s crime thriller it wants to be nor the apocalyptic fever dream it could have been,Rotten
"A reasonable approximation of the style, capturing Shannon at his most coolly insular.",Fresh
"Sluggish, stylized and frequently washed in a bilious green tint, The Missing Person is yet oddly irresistible, its omnipresent anxiety like a musical chord that neither rises nor falls.",Fresh
"The moments that do undeniably work are overshadowed by a general feeling that the film just isn't quite clicking the way it could or should have, amplified by a final act that simply gets away from everyone involved.",Rotten
"""So you make jokes and smoke cigarettes,"" a lady in the murk summarizes. Yeah. Isn't that enough?",Fresh
"Shannon's complete performance, he moves like The Elephant Man and enunciates like Mickey Rourke, allows Buschel to drift into David Lynch territory without getting drowned in it.",Fresh
"Why has The Missing Person persisted in staying with me, even though I started craving The Big Sleep halfway through?",Fresh
"The Missing Person isn't merely a clever, cool spin on the classic private eye story, but it also works as a private eye story. It showcases a lurching, hunched, quietly lived-in performance by Shannon but offers more than just that performance. ...",Fresh
"Michael Shannon is a handsome kook whose turns in Revolutionary Road, Bug and this have earmarked him to be the next Jack Nicholson (or at least the next Christopher Walken)",Rotten
"It's a great-looking movie, with an evocative use of music and, in rugged-yet-sensitive Michael Shannon, has an actor whose forceful, focused presence is the film's sturdy linchpin.",Fresh
It's beautiful dread.,Fresh
Buschel makes striking use of the Mike Hammer/Philip Marlowe tradition to tell a story of disorientation and loss in a post-9/11 world where the Twin Towers can go missing too.,Fresh
Michael Shannon adds another stunning performance to his resume with this small-scale neo-noir by writer/director Noah Buschel.,Fresh
The real mystery here is how writer-director Noah Buschel talked recent supporting Oscar nominees Michael Shannon and Amy Ryan into doing this movie.,Rotten
"There's a pretty good film if you give writer-director Noah Buschel a chance. The 31-year-old crafts a convincing noir tale, with a sense of realism that makes the experience pleasingly voyeuristic.",Fresh
"Most of it is admittedly a lot of fun, especially when the characters come out intriguingly sideways.",Fresh
"The atmosphere of the film is similar to the Ellery Queen detective stories of yesteryear, but the result is not nearly as good.",Rotten
The Missing Person arrives at something much more depthed than its neo-noir mystery format initially suggests.,Fresh
"The mood is also set by the top notch work by d.p. Ryan Samul, and the predominant jazz score. You can almost smell the stale cigarettes as the music comes in when Rosow enters a bar...",Fresh
"Though it's a near thing, the movie isn't quite bad enough to qualify as a classic tone-deaf vanity production.",Rotten
It's clear from Polanski's cramped frames that [director] Chapa knows as little about filmmaking as he does his subject.,Rotten
This Friday the 13th Los Angeles vanity release isn't even fun in a bad-movie way.,Rotten
"To describe the film as this generation's ""Wired"" hardly begins to scratch the surface. This is a movie so bad that the people who actually made ""Wired"" can actually look down upon it without coming across as hypocritical.",Rotten
"Ambitious in an obsessive, stalkerish sort of way, Damian Chapa(TM)s low-budget biopic of Roman Polanski is avowedly empathetic and thus not a complete hatchet job.",Rotten
"A jumbled, whorish, opportunistic hot mess, multi-hyphenate Chapa's film is a fantastically terrible biopic, poorly told and riddled with repeated, confounding lapses in logic.",Rotten
Comes with too much repetitive exposition and lacks an emotional payoff.,Rotten
"It's an easy movie to snipe at, but its quest for authenticity, even in its most affluent characters, is honorable.",Fresh
"Moodysson actually really loves his characters and wants them to be happy, rather than putting stock characters though a series of heavily predictable trials and tribulations on the way to a forced happy ending.",Fresh
It is all too simplistic and obvious and increasingly the preachy tone becomes irritating.,Rotten
"A transitional, almost deliberately pensive movie from a director who typically charts a ruthlessly direct course.",Rotten
"English, Tagalog, and Thai are spoken in Swedish writer-director Lukas Moodysson's Mammoth, but he communicates only in the idiom of Crash and Babel: the Esperanto of feel-bad humanism.",Rotten
Focuses on the strong and universal desire of both the rich and the poor for a loving connection with their children and the obstacles which can hinder that intimacy.,Fresh
"The movie lacks the personal touch that's distinguished even Moodysson's ""difficult"" films.",Rotten
a remarkably subtle exploration of family in a time of capitalism,Fresh
"Features various storylines centered on the same weighty themes, which mean to say so much about the human condition and modernity that they end up saying perilously little.",Rotten
"The overlapping stories, the emotional disconnect, the heavy-handed symbolism -- no, it's not a movie from the makers of Babel, its a mumbling, stammering copycat drama from Swedish director Lukas Moodysson.",Rotten
"Takes a bit too long to get going and perhaps bites off more thematically than it can chew, but it has too many intriguing ideas and spectacular performances to be dismissed.",Fresh
"In Mammoth, when a rich child eats her lunch in New York, a poor boy in the Philippines cries. And so it goes, as privilege begets exploitation with grimly deterministic logic and pages and pages of bad dialogue.",Rotten
"Less obsessed with coincidence and more interested in the ways people from various cultures connect, or don't quite connect, in everyday situations.",Fresh
Mammoth manages to be as affecting as it is heartfelt.,Fresh
Any semblance of subtlety was unfortunately lost in translation.,Rotten
"There are so many reasons to be outraged and depressed by this film, indeed, that it all but distracts from the real and immediate qualities of the four fine actors.",Fresh
The movie is at once intimate and (in its softhearted way) preachy.,Fresh
The message of the movie seems to be that Americans can solve guilt by paying the right person.,Fresh
"Too many films exploit the perils faced by children when the social contract is ruptured, but Mammoth earns its cruel, sensationalistic turns and then some.",Fresh
"Mammoth features sensational moments of reaction and deliberation communicated by a gifted cast, building a few symbolic global bridges, more appreciable for their design than their destination.",Fresh
"A return to form by Moodysson although the bigger Irritu-like stuff -- globalisation, poverty, fraying family relationships -- are all a bit too neat to really engage.",Fresh
"An interesting idea, but Mammoth's good intentions -- like its characters' -- are lost somewhere in the delivery.",Rotten
An inexorable dread holds the attention (if you've seen Moodysson's disturbing Lily-4-Ever you'll know what to expect) and as tragedy moves ever closer it's difficult too look away.,Fresh
Mammoth is a masterclass in feel-bad cinema.,Fresh
"[A] fatuous, self-serving and fantastically dishonest exercise in pseudo-compassion, composed in the supercilious ""globalised"" style of Alejandro Gonzlez Iarritu's 2006 film Babel.",Rotten
As woolly and elephantine as its title.,Rotten
"Mammoth is well-meaning, but ultimately contrived and melodramatic.",Fresh
"Lukas Moodysson's approach to filmmaking was becoming increasingly experimental, so it is a surprise to see how conventional Mammoth is.",Fresh
"This is an impressively directed, superbly acted and emotionally engaging drama, though the script is occasionally a little heavy-handed and the whole thing is nearly scuppered by a jaw-droppingly crass final line.",Fresh
Moodysson braids these threads with contrived symmetries. The preaching soon grows wearisome.,Rotten
There's nothing intrinsically wrong with message movies like this provided the characters feel real (they don't) and it's handled with a light touch (it isn't).,Rotten
"[A] Babel-ish drama about the malaises wrought by globalisation, how we're closer than ever, and yet, if I'm not mistaken, farther apart. Unfortunately, you've seen it already.",Rotten
Mammoth looks sleek and is well-acted but the preachy tone is hard to bear.,Rotten
"This is the Mike Leigh paradis terrestre, as good as it gets.",Fresh
"Having spent a decade purposefully alienating audiences, Swedish writer/director Lukas Moodysson claws his way back into the mainstream with this condescending, glossy slice of We Are The World-style film-making.",Rotten
"The real trouble with Mammoth is that [Lukas] Moodysson, more practiced in subtlety than he's given credit for, exhibits none here.",Rotten
The film's depiction of capitalism's erosion of the family unit is so heavy-handed that any emotional or affecting moments are undermined by the transparency of Moodysson's intentions.,Rotten
"A film neither willfully difficult nor easily accessible, conjuring an illusion of vapidness that may be rather too convincing for some audiences.",Rotten
A well-balanced and thought-provoking documentary that doesn't forget the cinema-going experience needs to entertain as well as educate.,Fresh
"""Crude"" is a knock-your-socks-off documentary that will leave you speechless. It's the best documentary of the year.",Fresh
A good cause does not necessarily a fully satisfying movie make.,Rotten
"Like ""The Cove"", this is inspiring and dramatically involving documentary film at its best.",Fresh
"A stinging indictment of the huge Chevron corporation, which has been sued for despoiling the Ecuadorian Amazon to the severe detriment of the indigenous population.",Fresh
It's impossible to watch this film and not come away with a personal vow never to patronize the Chevron corporation again.,Fresh
"Berlinger doesn't counter Chevron's counter charges with facts and figures. With footage of petrochemical-sludge swamps and babies covered with flaming sores, he doesn't especially need to.",Fresh
"Joe Berlinger's remarkable documentary, Crude, recounts an infuriating litany of South American exploitation, backroom glad-handing, and bureaucratic dead ends.",Fresh
Crude is both a tribute to human-rights tenacity and a sobering account of the multinational-Moloch greed that can keep justice in limbo.,Fresh
"while Berlinger allows the film to get a little too star-struck, spending less time with the winningly humble patchwork alliance doing the lawsuit's hard work, Crude at least acknowledges the reason behind this shift",Fresh
"Keeps a tight focus on a sprawling topic, condensing three years of production into a narrative that neatly lays out the history of the controversy, the opposing viewpoints and key players",Fresh
Involving doc about the devastating impact of oil exploration on Ecuador's rainforest community.,Fresh
"When well-meaning Trudie Styler, founder of Rainforest Foundation (and Sting's wife), comes on, even Farjardo's convictions and Berlinger's early scenes about native culture and ancestry get swept up amidst hubristic hubbub.",Rotten
"Mr. Berlinger has both a strong narrative instinct and a keen eye for incongruous, evocative and powerful images.",Fresh
"Berlinger gives a good amount of time to the big oil representatives, but it's clear that he's on the side of the people. Aside from that, Crude is a fine work of journalism.",Fresh
Crude is remarkably clear-eyed in the way it shows how even people on the right side of a cause only succeed if they're willing to play a little dirty.,Fresh
The film is fair (which is different from being objective) and works hard at representing both points of view. That it's already been denounced in some quarters is only proof he has the oil companies worried.,Fresh
Embedded in the story are enough intriguing characters and moments of high human drama for it to function more like a piece of effective fiction than a work of overwrought agitprop.,Fresh
"A provocative, well-balanced, illuminating and thoroughly engrossing documentary.",Fresh
"A dynamic and dramatic documentary about the David vs. Goliath dimensions of the ""Amazon Chernobyl"" case where indigenous tribal groups are fighting the multinational corporation Chevron.",Fresh
Here's a powerhouse of a documentary that makes you feel mad as hell and unwilling to take it anymore.,Fresh
"A heart-wrenching, alarming and brilliantly crafted documentary about Chevron's desecration of the Ecuadorian Amazon, and the 27-billion dollar law suit in which indigenous peoples seek remediation and justice.",Fresh
No film could convey all the complexities of the case -- what Crude does is air the plaintiffs' claims and show the lawyers at work.,Fresh
Powerful and powerfully upsetting.,Fresh
Looking for another reason to leave your car at home? Go see Crude.,Fresh
"A legal thriller, it's a three-year investigation into the disaster environmentalists call the ""Amazonian Chernobyl"" that offers both sides of the story and leaves the viewer in the position of jury.",Fresh
It will certainly remain in your mind the next time you stop for gas.,Fresh
"Crude has all the hallmarks of a John Grisham story - sharp lawyers, raw greed, Big Business behaving badly. The difference is that this David-vs.-Goliath story is no work of fiction.",Fresh
Berlinger provides a bracing and intelligent look at how such battles are (and perhaps must be) fought in a world that's hardly lacking when it comes to tales of injustice.,Fresh
...a better balance of the human element against that of politics and courtrooms would have given the film a stronger emotional hook.,Fresh
"This isn't just a story of right and wrong, it's a story of money and media and, most of all, spin.",Fresh
"It's a David-and-Goliath tale, full of anger and disturbing accusation, but it's also inspiring.",Fresh
"...good documentary filmmaking and an interesting, thought-provoking, subject.",Fresh
"If you ever had doubts about the impact that celebrities can have on such a David-and-Goliath struggle, Berlinger methodically removes them.",Fresh
"At first Crude looks like one more environmental agit-doc intended to outrage and inspire. Director Joe Berlinger is no doctrinaire hack, though.",Fresh
"While the audience may see smoking guns in every oily soil sample and every sick kid, Crude is only a progress report of a case that might last until well into the decade, the sordid details of which are still, pardon the pun, spilling out.",Fresh
"An elegantly structured, horrifying film that shows the vanishing rainforest may be the least of the Amazon's worries.",Fresh
"As the film very eloquently implies, when the greater good is defined as profits, and a lack of culpability is proportionate to your number of shareholders, well . . . a lot of petroleum-soaked chickens will be coming home to roost.",Fresh
An engrossing case for justice.,Fresh
"A gripping, multifaceted thriller about media politics, global economics, and legal infighting. Wherever your sympathies fall, this may teach you a lot about the way the modern world works.",Fresh
One has to wonder if oil industry executives are concerned about the release of Joe Berlinger's damning documentary.,Fresh
"What Crude does best is take us behind the scenes and show in often candid detail how campaigns are waged, tactics decided on and strategies prioritized.",Fresh
"'Crude,' thankfully, brings insight and urgency to an issue that has until recently been ignored",Fresh
"Crude unfolds like a pretty good legal thriller. Which, when you really think about it, is what this documentary feature is.",Fresh
"A powerfully emotional documentary that grips like an expert legal thriller - by turns uplifting, suspenseful and utterly devastating, this is likely to be one of the best documentaries of the year.",Fresh
This intense documentary tells a hugely important story that's packed with compelling characters and situations. Although a repetitive structure and a sense of agonising futility conspire to undermine the vital lessons it has to teach us.,Fresh
Not exactly genre-bending innovation or anything but a decent documentary about an important episode in history of oil company exploitation.,Fresh
"A bleak, necessarily incomplete tale, and suffers from a late intrusion by celebrity eco-botherer Trudi Styler. But with this gripping, angry film, Berlinger has put himself back on the side of the angels.",Fresh
"Although the real-life outcome may be known to some, Crude still, at its best, unfolds like a courtroom thriller.",Fresh
"The Ecuadorians' fight continues, and their courage isn't to be doubted. Even the much-mocked, much-maligned campaigner Trudie Styler emerges with credit for supporting them.",Fresh
"Structurally a little jumbled, it's still a worthy addition to the angry eco-doc subgenre.",Fresh
"Gripping and powerful, Crude is documentary journalism as it needs to be. Blissful ignorance stirred with bland apathy is no longer an option.",Fresh
"There's much speechifying, with no high-octane finale - but that's near-unavoidable for a case still dragging on amid corrupt politicking.",Fresh
"Berlinger's purpose is not to cheerlead or show Fajardo rubbing shoulders with celebrity activists like Trudie Styler and Sting, but to highlight how easily money can tilt the scales of justice.",Fresh
"While the current trend in documentaries is to take stories and wrap them into neat little packages, Crude runs merrily against the grain.",Fresh
"Few of these films ever take solid, substantive slices of truth or attestation from both sides. They are always partial, which vitiates the eagerness with which we would, if we could, espouse the cause of downtrodden.",Rotten
Joe Berlinger's film is a suitably forensic dissection of an ecological disaster and much less of a crusading piece of polemic than documentaries such as An Inconvenient Truth.,Fresh
"The arguments are batted back and forth, and one's sympathy for the Ecuadorean side takes only a slight wobble when Trudi Styler gets behind the cause.",Fresh
A well-balanced documentary all the more incisive for its decision to eschew editorialising and let the evidence speak for itself.,Fresh
"A sturdy, hard-hitting account.",Fresh
"In a welcome change from many recent documentaries with an activist bent, the director is never seen on camera, never heard on the soundtrack, and does precious little overt editorializing.",Fresh
Another interesting film from Joe Berlinger,Fresh
Well shows how a canny public relations campaign is a key part of legal strategy to even up the odds in the court of world opinion. . .But does not get below the surface.,Fresh
"Yes, Crude talks about the environmental impact of oil exploitation, but it is not just another documentary about this subject... it is the human perspective that prevails, showing the human cost of each drop of oil we consume. [Full review in Spanish]",Fresh
"Though one-sided and all too happy to assail an easy target such as a monstrous oil company, Crude backs up its rhetoric by providing footage and images of the people and terrain affected...",Fresh
A n intricate dual character study.,Fresh
"Another dark, gloomy drama about home life during wartime, this film features some seriously great performances and a theme that will resonate powerfully with thoughtful audiences.",Fresh
"Although Hollywood has dealt with the war from various perspectives, Moverman's film offers a new angle that brings the horrors home about the decision to go to war.",Fresh
"What could have been a grim, depressing Iraq war drama of men who deliver dreaded news becomes in Moverman's promising debut a tale of grief and survival, a balance of grave issues and humor.",Fresh
A penetrating assessment of post-war readjustment.,Fresh
"The Messenger manages to be both practical and patriotic in the same breath, zeroing in on one of the most painful aspects of wartime.",Fresh
A well-performed example of male bonding in the army.,Fresh
"This richly conceived powerhouse drama about life and death is ultimately about the search for a sense of family, whether in peace or war, and what binds humans together despite the most unendurable horrors at hand.",Fresh
"This is a fully felt, morally alert, marvellously acted piece of work. Despite the grim subject, it's a sweet-tempered movie, with moments of explosive humor -- an entertainment.",Fresh
Moverman's scripting is subdued and emotionally authentic.,Fresh
"Grief is universal, and watching soldiers deal with complex emotions seems to me universal too.",Fresh
As powerful and restrained a drama as you could wish for...a film of both great sadness and great redemption.,Fresh
A story that strays about without finding its center.,Rotten
"The Messenger honors those who fought and died in Iraq by acting out, with an anguished handheld immediacy, how large each of those sacrifices really is.",Fresh
"These largely self-contained vignettes are harrowing, the source of a font of raw emotional release that could never be otherwise captured except through a presumably invasive documentary process.",Fresh
So bungled up with fashionable ambivalence about the Iraq War that every single behavioral detail is not just prejudicial but wrong.,Rotten
"Intelligent, graceful, and touching filmmaking.",Fresh
No quote available.,Fresh
"The Messenger, showing humanity under siege, opens wounds inflicted by the Iraq War -- not on the battlefield but in the hearts of the families of soldiers who never made it back home.",Fresh
...a poignant tale of redemption that counts as one of the very best films of the year.,Fresh
"What The Messenger has going for it is some sober, straightforward direction from Oren Moverman and a few strong performances.",Fresh
"As the lonely, complex and friendly Stone, Harrelson evokes the experience of The Messenger as sturdily as a freshly pinned medal of valor.",Fresh
This film will be too much for some viewers because of the spot-on antiwar statement but the story is tight and the performances powerful.,Fresh
"Harrelson's calm performance anchors the film, and whenever the story drifts back to him and his cautious friendship with Foster, the flick feels true.",Fresh
"In his directorial debut, Moverman is a very confident filmmaker, one who can sustain unbroken scenes of over 10 minutes without making it seem self-indulgent or gimmicky.",Fresh
"Many scenes in The Messenger feel merely illustrative, not designed to develop characters and story so much as to make the point, over and over, that the home front can be as harrowing as the front lines.",Rotten
"A devastating debut helmed with immense power and control ... Foster, a rising talent whose career brings to mind Edward Norton, is tremendous.",Fresh
"Moverman understands the deep, powerful struggle that must accompany such constant grappling with death.",Fresh
"A somber drama about intimate wartime tragedies, Oren Moverman's debut feels more respectful than real.",Fresh
Oren Moverman's sober and satisfying drama shows how the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq have created a fissure in American society.,Fresh
"Messengers with the worst possible message, they nonetheless manage to be human and alive .... In a film that itself bears sad tidings about the costs of war, that is an affirming, even an inspiring, gift.",Fresh
The Messenger is a successful examination of the harsh realities of war that too often are put in the back of people's minds.,Fresh
"Together, under the assured direction of first-time feature filmmaker Oren Moverman, these three actors tell a story that is at once hard-hitting and bizarrely gentle.",Fresh
"It's worth seeing for Foster's performance anyway, and for a brief and excellent one from Steve Buscemi as a mourner.",Fresh
"For all the film's gritty verisimilitude, The Messenger is not the great Iraq War movie that Kathryn Bigelow's The Hurt Locker is.",Rotten
"A sobering, well-acted look at a reality for thousands of American families.",Fresh
Just don't watch this and The Hurt Locker back to back or you'll need to refill your anti-depressants when you're done.,Fresh
"A fine bookend to Katheryn Bigelow's The Hurt Locker, showing another side of how the war at home can be just as rigorous as the one abroad.",Fresh
"A shoddy, shouty bore. A piece of flummery.",Rotten
Poignant and insightful.,Fresh
"I'm not sure how Morton made sense of her character's ebbs and flows, but I never doubted her. She's a mariner in uncharted seas of emotion.",Fresh
"This character piece may be for the arthouse, but the artistry has a gaping wound, large enough to allow credulity to seep out.",Rotten
A universally relatable drama instead of just another story about Iraq.,Fresh
"The Messenger is a privileged glimpse into people's private pain, a drama shot with the simplicity and immediacy of a documentary.",Fresh
The scenes are rendered by director Oren Moverman with an authenticity and realism that makes them as harrowing and heartrending as they deserve to be.,Fresh
One of the most powerful and moving films about the human cost of the Afghan-Iraq war and about those of war in general to appear in years.,Fresh
Director Oren Moverman's feature-length debut is a little like The Hurt Locker in the way it uncomfortably probes a little-known military organelle.,Fresh
"The Messenger knows that even if it tells a tearjerking story, it doesn't have to be a tearjerker. In fact, when a sad story tries too hard, it can be fatal.",Fresh
Foster leaves you hoping that Will finds his way home.,Fresh
It brings home the horror of the Iraq war in a way that much of our TV news media have failed to do.,Fresh
One of the rare movies that communicates honestly and artfully about the real casualties of war: the surviving combatants.,Fresh
"A stunning debut, an effective, expertly-made and performed drama about the common human ability to deal with tragedy and loss in unique, unpredictable ways.",Fresh
Don't call it a comeback because Woody Harrelson never went away! This film that will remind everyone how good of an actor he is.,Fresh
"Some jobs are dirtier than others, and after seeing director and co-writer Oren Moverman's beautifully acted new film The Messenger, you'll be better acquainted with some of the most grueling work a human being can be called upon to perform.",Fresh
There is a complexity to the story and characters that I want more insight on and I really believe that the movie might grow on me with a repeat viewing.,Fresh
This film doesn't take political sides -- and it's all the more heartbreaking because of its restraint.,Fresh
"Individually, none of the mini-dramas in The Messenger would be enough to blow you away. But grouped together, they're so beautifully and specifically written that they make for a convincing picture of the first stages of grief.",Fresh
"This is a wholly different look at the fallout of the Iraq War and its effect on soldiers and civilians. It is also a gentle portrait of grief, friendship and solace.",Fresh
A forcefully acted and peculiar emotional drama...,Fresh
"The Messenger delivers what it has to say without sensationalism or political posturing. That restraint, along with the quality of the performances, makes it all the more powerful.",Fresh
"The beauty in Foster's portrayal is that it never completely explodes, but anger and aching seethe behind his eyes. Harrelson, meanwhile, is a good old boy with a bad old job.",Fresh
"Whenever writer-director Oren Moverman moves past these scattered and admittedly voyeuristic moments into the lives of the two soldiers, the movie drifts into received wisdom and unconvincing romance.",Rotten
Foster and Harrelson have a winning camaraderie as they develop a bond of trust and friendship. Both performances are memorable and deserve year-end awards consideration.,Fresh
"Because of the nature of its subject matter, 'The Messenger' is emotionally charged, but director Oren Moverman and his able cast prevent it from feeling phony or manipulative.",Fresh
"The Messenger involves difficult subject matter, but it's not hard to watch. It's sad and sobering, but also humorous and touching at turns.",Fresh
...[The Messenger] highlights the gulf between those who have served in Iraq and nearly everyone else they deal with after returning home.,Fresh
Harrelson gives what might be a career performance as a jaded mentor who tries to conduct each notification using a well-rehearsed set of rules of engagement.,Fresh
"Co-screenwriter/director Oren Moverman slowly peels back the layers to the characters, with the game cast helping considerably in that regard.",Fresh
The best war movies don't preach against war: They remind us of the costs for soldiers and families and ask us to consider whether those costs are worth paying.,Fresh
Gripping but uneven home front war drama.,Fresh
"The miracle of this film is in its insistence on finding a way back home -- to fragile new beginnings giving way to new friendship, perhaps even new love.",Fresh
I used to think working at the Salt Lake City Hooters was the worst job in the world. Boy was I wrong. That dubious occupational honor goes to working for the Army's Casualty Notification Service.,Fresh
This is the type of original film that should be pulling in the box office numbers. Harrelson and Foster deliver completely natural and raw performances. See this movie now!,Fresh
"Like ""The Hurt Locker"", calculated to sell tickets to tea-baggers and Moveon.org alike. Informed by the Clint Eastwood/Paul Haggis school of bad didactic screenwriting.",Rotten
This is a powerful war film that never needs to enter the battlefield for you to be fully absorbed.,Fresh
"At its center lie three accomplished performances, by Ben Foster, Woody Harrelson and Samantha Morton, that are not to be missed.",Fresh
"Yes, you're going to have to look for The Messenger. But the fact it's one of the best American films of 2009 makes that search worthwhile.",Fresh
"Beyond the interesting subjects, Moverman doesn't have a definitive place for his film to go.",Rotten
It's hard to believe that an actor of Ben Foster's caliber is just now getting a leading role.,Fresh
"Foster is a revelation, while Harrelson has arguably never been better.",Fresh
An emotionally affecting drama about the birth of compassion in an Iraq war hero assigned to work for the Casualty Notification Office.,Fresh
"In an indirect sense, this film is also about the reality of war as opposed to the illusions about war.",Fresh
"Powerful and resonant, this is a film that asks us to look at the human cost of war. Ben Foster is a revelation.",Fresh
Valiantly brings all wars to their ultimate endpoint: death and its effects on the fallen's loved ones.,Fresh
"This is the kind of film people might skip due to the preponderance of war movies out there, or forget in the wake of flashier end-of-the-year output, but The Messenger is one to watch for great performances.",Fresh
"Implies without stating, allowing us to understand and interpret the men as we will, without having anything forced down our throats.",Fresh
"Well acted, bare-bones look at homefront horror, but it's not quite in the same war league as The Hurt Locker.",Fresh
The Messenger makes it [the death of a soldier] personal. And it is uncomfortable. Well-done movies about the tragedy of war and its impact on ordinary lives are that way.,Fresh
"With the insight and sensitivity of an insider, The Messenger illuminates the sometimes invisible victims of war -- the survivors -- and a pain that is tolerated but never quite healed.",Fresh
"As suspenseful -- in its less-violent way -- as 'The Hurt Locker,' as the soldiers bring their bad news to the homes of unsuspecting family members in a series of devastating vignettes, beautifully wrought by director Oren Moverman.",Fresh
"The Messenger is a film about shock and healing. Forget awe. In a world that avoids the realities of war, The Messenger casts a flickering light on some of the human cost of war.",Fresh
"The Messenger is the first film from Oren Moverman as a director, and it's a fine piece of work.",Fresh
Harrelson gives us layers of hurt under a callous yet needy crust. It may be the best performance of his career and certainly deserves Oscar consideration.,Fresh
A film that never forgets those who most feel the pain of loss during a time of war.,Fresh
...a stunningly sad and sobering movie about the inevitable personal costs of national bellicosity.,Fresh
The Messenger's clipped insight that war is hell is just the sort of line straight from the manual that the film strenuously cautions against.,Rotten
"There isn't a single glimpse of battlefield action in The Messenger, but Foster conveys the intensity of warfare in a long speech revealing how Will was injured.",Fresh
"A sobering drama that at its core is a heterosexual love story between two men. To be clear, there's no homoerotic undercurrent here but it's a love story of opposites falling for each other nevertheless.",Fresh
Hero Without a Cause,Rotten
"Harrelson received an Oscar nomination for supporting actor for his grim and volatile performance, but it could just as easily have gone to the quietly seething Foster.",Fresh
"%u2026 while several [Irag war movies] have touched on the soldiers' internal experience, none have stayed with it for the duration of the film the way The Messenger does.",Fresh
A wrenching and superbly acted character study.,Fresh
"There is great power in examining raw human emotions, especially when it's done so gracefully and honestly.",Fresh
"The bombshell is the news of a soldier's death and the delivery of that message is the heart of this unsentimental, yet deeply moving, story.",Fresh
It's Foster's movie.,Fresh
"The film is premised on the verbal communication of urgent information, yet its many non-verbal moments provide the greatest strength and clarity.",Fresh
...Foster and Harrelson's respectively striking work is alone justification for the film's existence.,Fresh
The vignettes of reactions to Montgomery and Stone's grim visits are the meat of the movie.,Fresh
"The first warning bell sounds when Woody boasts of his AA membership, as I don't believe anybody has ever seen Harrelson stay sober for an entire movie... or even an afternoon.",Fresh
"Delivering the news to the families of soldiers who have made the ultimate sacrifice, a repressed Will is drawn to one empathetic widow.",Fresh
"A tremendously moving drama, filled with heartbreak, humor and, most importantly, humanity.",Fresh
"Nice acting. Solid direction. Worth an investment of your time. Paul Chambers, CNN.",Fresh
"A powerful, PTSD PSA for 'Don't ask, don't kiss and tell' advocates.",Fresh
... a powerful perspective on the casualties of war.,Fresh
"The Messenger drives home the point that war is a losing proposition, which has nothing to do with who is victorious on the battlefield. They're the everyday losses of life, of family, of friends.",Fresh
"The massage is important, and the acting from Harrelson is incredible.",Fresh
"It's sublime to see Woody Harrelson become Robert Duvall, with grit, gusto and muscles visibly twitching beneath his head. ""The Messenger"" is draining, but not numbing - an agnostic anthem to the impossibility of applying predictive methods to grief.",Fresh
"The film is poised, unforced and powerful.",Fresh
"The film doesn't tread a predictable, easy path, but stick with it because it has something to say and it is refreshingly different, mature and memorable",Fresh
A beautifully rendered and necessarily painful window onto an overlooked reality.,Fresh
"With deftly drawn characters and beautifully understated performances, this engaging drama is tremendously moving.",Fresh
"The two leads give nuanced, lived in performances that unfold slowly but with certain determination.",Fresh
"The film does lapse into cliche with Foster's descent into alcohol as a means of coping with the daily trauma of the job, but Israeli director Oren Moverman keeps the film rich in raw detail.",Fresh
"The worst job in the army isn't cleaning latrines or disarming roadside bombs, it is being back home telling people that someone they love has been killed.",Fresh
"Viewers will appreciate the work ethic up there on the screen, and how it finds a number of fresh and telling angles on the complexities of the grieving process.",Fresh
Woody Harrelson and Ben Foster dominate every inch of the screen.,Fresh
This is a great anti-war film examining the residual effect of war on the people who fight it and the people who are left behind.,Fresh
It's a tough job but someone's got to do it in a moving look at one of the armed forces' most harrowing details.,Fresh
There's essentially very little to take from The Messenger if you've already got it into your head that emotions are complicated and people are flawed.,Rotten
Shame nobody told writer-director Oren Moverman not to shoot The Messenger... before giving the script a good rewrite first.,Rotten
"A worthy addition to the canon of Iraq war films, The Messenger has a gentle humanity that creeps under your skin.",Fresh
A powerhouse performance full of tragic comic undertones while looking at the psychological effects of war in an original storytelling manner...,Fresh
The Oscar-nominated script pursues a grimly honourable task into its grim and not always honourable byways.,Fresh
"Intimate, powerful filmmaking.",Fresh
It's a welcome addition to the increasingly interesting movie canon dealing with the downside of the war.,Fresh
"[An] unpredictable, episodic, deeply resonant character piece.",Fresh
An intelligent and well-acted film which deserves its outing here.,Fresh
"It's a film of quietly assured dramatic clout, a strong and sober reckoning with American conscience.",Fresh
"Stumbles a little, loosening its grip in the bromantic final stretch. But if impenitent heartstring pluckage is what you're after, this is where it's at.",Fresh
This worthwhile drama reports from the home front as the war on terror continues.,Fresh
Don't let the fact Woody Harrelson got an Oscar nomination tempt you anywhere near The Messenger - the message here is about as welcome as a death knock on a wet Sunday afternoon.,Rotten
"An intelligent, superbly acted and moving drama that manages to say more about war and its consequences than most films set on the front line.",Fresh
"Although it stumbles on the storytelling, drifting rather repetitively around the lives of its haunted protagonists, it's a rewarding, humane picture.",Fresh
Foster and an Oscar-nominated Harrelson effectively convey the outward steel and inner fragility of these men of war but the film is slow-moving and maudlin.,Rotten
The Messenger takes on a warmth and plangency that rewards viewing.,Fresh
It's a shame so few people will see this on the silver screen.,Fresh
"It never feels contrived or overwritten, managing to deftly pack emotional punches through the strength of its performances and direction.",Fresh
"Alejado de cualquier rastro de patriotismo, desnudando la complejidad emocional detr√°s de un drama hist√≥ricamente recurrente que ha sido retratado con frecuencia por el cine norteamericano, aunque esta vez de manera un poco m√°s intimista.",Fresh
I know several folks in military service who wouldn't watch this movie if you paid them.,Rotten
"The Messenger is always just left of straightforward, which keeps it interesting.",Fresh
"[Foster and Harrelson's] interplay, on the job (ruining the day of one unfortunate person after the next) and off...provides the backbone of this erratically paced film.",Fresh
"It is relentlessly bleak, even in its lighter moments. The downbeat tone is wearying. These days, we just need some hope.",Rotten
An extraordinary anti-war film that does not engage in polemics. The Messenger's extreme effectiveness is due to the brilliant acting of Ben Foster and Woody Harrelson.,Fresh
One of the most powerful and humane war dramas to spring from this current conflict.,Fresh
Thoughtfully dissects the overarching consequences of that unfortunate conflict.,Fresh
"The Messenger is seeded with unspoken truth, resulting in a dramatic tour de force film with an enlightening and uplifting script, focusing on the fragility and resiliency of the human condition.",Fresh
"The Messenger is authentic and artful, and unpretentious but philosophical, in its approach to difficult material.",Fresh
Foster dazzles as a young man defusing the rage within.,Fresh
"The film conditions you to doubt, growing less suspenseful, less atmospheric, and less frightening as it progresses.",Rotten
"Genuinely compelling, this mock documentary from first time feature director Joel Anderson builds on its wonderfully eerie mood to deliver an enigmatic ghost story, family drama and story about a teenage girl with secrets.",Fresh
"This superbly constructed and executed film gets everything right, to the smallest detail, as it draws us into the imagined scenario.",Fresh
"As a ghost story, the underplaying of the actors helps to make the mystery creepily effective, but the mockumentary format is a bit of a cop-out because it allows the filmmaker to avoid all the big dramatic scenes.",Fresh
"Anderson's use of the documentary framework is an inspired choice, since it lends what we're seeing an air of reality that helps build the tension to jangling point.",Fresh
"Every time this slow-burning thriller appears to be running out of wick, Anderson's screenplay drops in an unexpected twist with impeccable timing.",Fresh
"It's actually very nicely done, using untrained actors and the documentary form disconcertingly well to destabilise audience expectations at a number of points. Is there a ghost story? Why is the family so rattled? What's happening?",Fresh
"It may be overstating it, but Anderson's command of cinematic language is right up there with Bryan Singer's audacious bag of tricks in The Usual Suspects.",Fresh
It's not so much scary as spooky (except for one really creepy moment) but this ghost story is less about supernatural hauntings than human secrets and lies.,Fresh
"The entire film may be a construct but the skilled direction, writing and acting give Lake Mungo a spooky 'realistic' authenticity.",Fresh
An after-the-fact faux-documentary about the death of a young girl -- and the creepy little hints she may have left behind.,Fresh
"It's actually quite difficult to imagine that this isn't a true story, and that the actors playing the tragic Palmers are not exactly who they say they are.",Fresh
And don't deny yourself the film's final creepy images - stay for the credits...,Fresh
"a sophisticated, adult tale that blends complex, compelling emotions with reflexive commentary on film as a 'medium' of memory, manipulation and magic... a classic supernatural enigma, once seen never forgotten.",Fresh
"Apologies to Samson and Delilah, Mary and Max and Balibo: the one true great Australian film of 2009 was easily Joel Anderson's Lake Mungo, a mournful, dreamlike examination of the hole left in the heart of a family after a death.",Fresh
This masterpiece of modern horror takes relatively safe elements and turns them into nightmarish factors of a grim and realist mockumentary. [Full review in Spanish].,Fresh
"This is an underappreciated, underseen gem.",Fresh
One of the horror genre's smartest and most innovative films of the 2000s.,Fresh
A Checkhovian Czech feature with restrained performances highlights the redemption of a gay teacher who ultimately emerges from the closet.,Fresh
"A beautifully shot, would-be-penetrating drama about a closeted teacher in a small Czech village falls victim to a wandering plot and muffled characterizatio",Rotten
"This sweetly ingenuous film, written and directed by Bohdan Slma, is a lot less sentimental about cows and flowers than it is about its human protagonists, who fall domino-like in love with churls who won't love them back.",Fresh
"Bohdan Slma's direction for The Country Teacher, a film characterized by beautifully long, languorous takes, has an assured expressiveness that's at odds with the story's bumpy narrative.",Rotten
A psychosexual rebirth occurs in a pastoral setting strewn with hay and intriguing links between human sexuality and insect behavior.,Fresh
"Directed by Bohdan Slma, it deals with weighty issues -- loneliness, sexual identity, love (straight and gay) -- in a quiet, intelligent fashion.",Fresh
The film's portrayal of farm life as a rugged pastorale lends The Country Teacher a foundation of visceral truth.,Fresh
"Has exquisite cinematography and occasional moments of tenderness, but its characters never truly come to life and its uneven screenplay doesn't fully explore their human struggles convincingly and sensitively enough to be make it an emotionally resonatin",Rotten
"It's a movie that demonstrates, if you'll pardon the sports metaphor, how deep the bench is in Eastern European film.",Fresh
The stunning pastoral setting at the core of The Country Teacher provides a sly backdrop for the troubled triangle at the heart of the heartfelt drama Czech writer-director Bohdan Slma.,Fresh
"Liska, who looks like a Central European version of the young Harvey Keitel, has a kind of pitch-perfect opacity.",Fresh
"Sometimes predictable, but it takes a number of surprising turns.",Fresh
Teacher is a comedy-drama that feels real and humane and keeps finding ways to surprise us because its characters are as complicated as real people tend to be.,Fresh
"Despite all the pain and self-loathing of its wounded characters, it's a pretty, heartwarming picture that tells us everybody needs somebody to help shatter that ol' boulder for good.",Fresh
"The film is graced with lovely performances by Pavel Liska as the teacher, Zuzana Bydzovska as Marie and Ladislav Sedivy as the boy.",Fresh
"A meaningful though patient drama built upon beautiful shots, a gentle humor and a great performance from Pavel Liska.",Fresh
The film boasts subtle performances and curious situations with unpredictable outcomes.,Fresh
"This small, contemporary Czech marvel showcases two bright talents and a sentiment not seen often enough on screen nowadays: sincerity.",Fresh
It's the kind of film that Hollywood used to excel at but no longer seems interested in making.,Fresh
"The actors are interesting rather than glamorous, their acting style consistently low-key, and their triumphs and failures realized on a human rather than grandiose scale.",Fresh
The didactic lecture on forgiveness was a bore and all the contrivances smelled like manure.,Rotten
Figuring out the true situation is what writer-director Bohdan Slma's beautifully nuanced character study is all about.,Fresh
"If great movies resulted purely from wizardly technical displays, then Czech writer-director Bohdan Sl√°ma's The Country Teacher would be a masterpiece to give B√©la Tarr pause.",Rotten
"The beauty of Mr. Slma's film is how it deftly unwraps a series of surprises for the audience, yet none of them seem like gratuitous twists.",Fresh
"A barnyard birthing scene becomes a life-changing event for three characters who, moments before, had no clue as to their fates...",Fresh
"The Apartment (1960) is producer/director Billy Wilder's bittersweet, heart-rending tragi-comedy/drama of a compliant insurance clerk (Lemmon) who secretly lends out his apartment to other company executives for adulterous sexual affairs and liaisons.",Fresh
It's impossible to feel sympathy for any of The Apartment's characters.,Rotten
A barbed and occasionally brutal comedy with few illusions about personal or corporate ethics.,Fresh
"A gleeful, tender and even sentimental film.",Fresh
Wilder and IAL Diamond's brilliantly witty screenplay has a serious undertow as it savages corporate ethics and conjugal infidelity.,Fresh
"This cynical study of office politics and sexual mores by Billy Wilder, despite winning 5 Oscars in 1960, doesn't date well.",Rotten
"There is a melancholy gulf over the holidays between those who have someplace to go, and those who do not. The Apartment is so affecting partly because of that buried reason.",Fresh
"With its somewhat edgy subject matter, the film would seem to defy the Hollywood conventions of its time; in fact it relies on these conventions and uses them with great skill.",Fresh
Quite simply one of the finest comic romances ever made.,Fresh
...it does examine some basic values of the post War years and serves as sociological evidence for the times,Fresh
"Sure it's a bit dated, but that's not the movie's fault. One of Wilder's best films ... and that's saying a whole lot!",Fresh
This comedy tells truths about American business and sexual mors as uncomfortable now as they were in 1960.,Fresh
"Among the funniest films ever to win a Best Picture, this was also risque for its time (and perhaps it is today to some).",Fresh
Elevates the workplace romance into a sublime erotics of officious addresses (the omnipresent Mister and Miss) and economic conundrum.,Fresh
The Apartment is the kind of unsuccessful picture that nevertheless demonstrates that everyone involved is capable of better work.,Rotten
This essential Billy Wilder film smoothly combines trenchant social observation with hilarious comedy.,Fresh
"It probably seemed more daring in 1960, but it's still adult entertainment in the best sense of the term.",Fresh
"A classic comedy, showing Billy Wilder at his cynical best.",Fresh
It's one of the most heartbreaking films I've ever seen.,Fresh
"Humanism and cleverness age like fine wine, even if served with spaghetti strained with a tennis racket.",Fresh
"Billy Wilder's second film to win the Best Picture Oscar, this bitter-sweet tale ""little people"" in the urban jungle is well-acted by Jack Lemmon and Shirley MacLaine.",Fresh
"In the canon of classics by famed writer/director Billy Wilder, this jewel of a comedy easily stands as one of his most beloved.",Fresh
Billy Wilder further enhances his filmic resume with this tender portrayal of a lonely man who may soon get what he deserves. Jack Lemmon is terrific.,Fresh
"I wouldn't call this 1960 picture one of Billy Wilder's best comedies -- it's drab, sappy, and overlong at 125 minutes.",Rotten
Billy Wilder somehow took a story about infidelity and suicide and made it into a comedy.,Fresh
The overlong drawn-out one-hook themed Apartment seemed a tad more bare than furnished.,Fresh
"Most of the time, it's up to director Wilder to sustain a two-hour-+ film on treatment alone, a feat he manages to accomplish more often than not, and sometimes the results are amazing.",Fresh
A film for anyone who's ever been in love or had a boss; forget the credit crunch and take out a lease on this Apartment right now.,Fresh
"With tremendous performances by the two leads (Lemmon and Shirley MacLaine), this is yet another ""must see"" title to be found on Wilder's resume.",Fresh
"A true classic. It's about advancement, ambition, corruption and adultery, and it operates as both a satire and a sorrowful romance.",Fresh
Not to be missed on any account.,Fresh
"[Lemmon's character is] a whingeing, self-pitying figure who, like other Wilder practitioners, cannot recognise the extent of his turpitude, and this is both the strength and weakness of a remarkable movie.",Fresh
"With finely judged performances from Jack Lemmon and Shirley MacLaine, it's a great way to spend an evening, and it's something you won't forget about in the morning.",Fresh
"A comedy of men's-room humours and water-cooler politics that now and then among the belly laughs says something serious and sad about the struggle for success, about what it often does to a man, and about the horribly small world of big business.",Fresh
"A perfect mix of comedy, drama, and romance, The Apartment showcases writer/director Billy Wilder at the peak of his creative talent.",Fresh
"The cast brings the film together, showing Lemmon and MacLaine as more than just comedic performers, but also as those who can hold their own with heavier script elements.",Fresh
This Oscar-winning Best Picture still has the power and appeal that won audiences over back in 1960.,Fresh
"Directed by Wilder with attention to detail and emotional reticence that belie its inherent darkness and melodramatic core, it's lifted considerably by the performances.",Fresh
"Even over a half-century on, The Apartment remains a biting classic due to its modern romantic sensibilities and Lemmon's commanding, thoroughly charming central performance.",Fresh
This really is a film of ever increasing returns.,Fresh
"No one does the pitchblack flipside of funny like Wilder, and 1960's The Apartment is the darkest he ever made.",Fresh
Jack Lemmon and Shirley MacLaine shine as two essentially good souls trapped in a tangle of office politics.,Fresh
"Wilder has made some truly great movies, but this one is not the masterpiece we thought it was.",Fresh
When assessing his own work Billy Wilder described The Apartment as being the film with the fewest mistakes. And he is right: it is as near to perfect as is possible.,Fresh
"Beautifully written and directed by the great Billy Wilder, bittersweet and heartfelt, this is sheer delight.",Fresh
{VIDEO ESSAY} Billy Wilder's classic Manhattan-based romantic comedy comes with a sly critique regarding 50's era corporate culture of rampant misogyny and unbridled ambition.,Fresh
"Despite some entertaining moments and a terrific performance by its lead, it's not a perfect film and does have some problems.",Fresh
"Wilder, a bilious and mercurial wit, here becomes a wide-screen master of time ...",Fresh
From such potentially edgy material Wilder and co-writer IAL Diamond sculpt an unforgettable romance.,Fresh
"...despite all its cynicism, The Apartment still ends on a hopeful note...",Fresh
"Production and direction wise, Wilder sustains his usual excellence. But his story is controversial and I am not one of those who can quite see The Apartment as the great comedy-drama he evidently intended it to be.",Fresh
"If it weren't for Lemmon's so affable execution of Wilder and I.A.L. Diamond's script, The Apartment could have been oppressively dark and cynical.",Fresh
"All this is quite a load for a comedy, but where else has social comment ever been so effective? Wilder hones his points to a piercing edge...",Fresh
"Savoury Shirley' Maclaine and savoury Jack Lemmon save the day, two sad comedians who never spell Pathos with a capital and make a good pair, credible and touching, pleasing rather than glamorous,",Fresh
A screen gem that attained classic status in about as much time as it takes to comb one's hair.,Fresh
"Billy Wilder's narrative eloquence, its spectacular scenes, the fantastic soundtrack signed by Adolph Deutsch and the brilliance and charm of its two protagonists make it an absolute delight. [Full Review in Spanish]",Fresh
"A black-hearted satire this smart, cutting, and hilarious is good even if it can't quite find a way out of its nihilism.",Fresh
It somehow manages to be both sardonic and warmhearted while observantly focusing on the romance...,Fresh
"While the mordant ruthlessness of the asides at the expense of big business intrigues, indiscretions and Christmas parties is compromised by a final sequence of quite awful sentimentality.",Rotten
"A masterpiece, absolute, complete, total and definitive. [Full Review in Spanish]",Fresh
"""Some people take, and some people get took,"" Bud says, and The Apartment never wavers in condemning the former and aligning itself with the latter.",Fresh
"Balancing the comedy and drama is perhaps the film's finest achievement, maintaining a synchronization that keeps the story alternately funny and poignant.",Fresh
"It remains a controversial, heavy-hitting classic from an auteur whose filmography is filled with them.",Fresh
"The ambiance of early 1900 Cape Cod is a character in this all-too-slight movie that could play better on cable, DVD, or an off-off-Broadway stage.",Rotten
"The sheer delight of this salty boy talk elder outing, is lifelong fierce courage on the high seas but acute commitment panic when females are around. While the male angst tragic ties surfacing between Rip Torn and David Carradine, are fatefully linked.",Fresh
"Imagine! It's an amusing, high-spirited romantic picture about senior citizens. What will they think of next?",Fresh
"The Golden Boys, writer-director Daniel Adams's adaptation of Joseph Lincoln's novel Cap'n Eri, could just as easily be called Grumpy Old Sea-Men or Two Brides for Three Salty Seadogs.",Rotten

Picturesque if plodding indie romantic comedy about three salty dogs in 1905 Cape Cod who bring in a would-be bride to keep house.,Fresh
Trying to sit through The Golden Boys is like trudging across the Cape Cod sand in galoshes during a nor'easter with a mule on your back.,Rotten
"All the admirable shipyard textures and thespian marquee value can't fog the fact that while peaceful, The Golden Boys is about as thrilling as an Abe Simpson bedtime story.",Rotten
"Taking place in 1905, this harmless serving of maritime malarkey may also boast the most liver spots on screen since Cocoon.",Rotten
This musty yarn would have worked better as a 1940s MGM programmer.,Rotten
You don't have to be a geezer to grin at these goings-on.,Fresh
"The Golden Boys is an object lesson in how to squander a seasoned cast, a charming premise and a breathtaking location.",Rotten
"This tale of three codgery sea captains looking for a wife is not all that romantic, or especially comic.",Rotten
"The three vets are a delight to watch, even if the movie around them remains soggy.",Rotten
"It seems particularly perverse to take actors who helped develop the '60's thesping style of hang-loose, semi-improvisational immediacy and stick them in a creaky period piece glazed with arch gentility and ersatz quaintness.",Rotten

"Much of Fame draws us in, through the irresistible appeal of young people bursting with energy.",Fresh
"A film that's largely a raw, uplifting love letter to creativity in every possible form.",Fresh
A cheesy production with underdeveloped characters that feels more like a TV pilot than a self-contained motion picture.,Rotten
"Tancharoen's background shows and steps in to save the film: highlights include an infectious rap in the canteen, a Hallowe'en ""Carnevil,"" and a show-stopper in a club, courtesy of Naughton.",Fresh
A watered-down tone ... causes the movie to drift dramatically between its musical and dance sequences.,Rotten
"Mullally has the most poignant moment, admitting to her students that the reason she teaches is because fame, for her, just wasn't in the cards. (Stardom, more than in the first film, is golden here.)",Fresh
"Some of the students specialize in classical music, others in dance, and still others in singing and acting, but the one thing they all have in common is their apparent enrollment in Clichs 101.",Rotten
"As a demo reel showcasing seven promising young talents from their freshman through senior years, it's pleasant enough. As a movie dramatizing the talent and dedication required to make it, the Fame reboot has fleet feet but lacks heart.",Rotten
"The new Fame has the feel of diluted imitation -- slick, superficial, short on heart.",Rotten
"The '80s sensation is reborn for the High School Musical generation. But sadly, this one's all fame, no journey.",Rotten
"While there are a few select highlights, it's nothing new and is certainly nothing exceptional or noteworthy.",Rotten
Lives are spared in this sugarless new version of Alan Parker's movie and the TV show it spawned. But innocent songs and unsuspecting dance routines are hacked to bits.,Rotten
"The 1980 film was not great, but its concept was fresher, the music and dance seductive and the stories emotional, but this recycled version is too slick, bland, and overly familiar due to Disney's High School Musical series and American Idol.",Rotten
"Thanks to the blitheringly awful script -- credited screenwriter Allison Burnett disavows it, and he willingly put his name on Feast of Love and Untraceable -- we barely get to know any of the young lead characters.",Rotten
"The new, unimproved Fame won't live forever except in DVD cutout bins, and remembering anyone's name will be a chore.",Rotten

"As a group this cast probably wouldn't even make it past Hollywood week on ""American Idol"".",Rotten
"Like its gifted if excitable protagonists, Fame would have done well to stay in the classroom a bit more, rather than trolling the New York streets.",Rotten
"It's almost fatally modest. But it has a sweet spirit, and it offers only one true moment of inadvertent camp: a (lame) finale featuring an African dance routine completely at odds with all the white bread we've just been served.",Fresh
A bad film that at times is sublimely cheesy.,Rotten

"Fans of the original won't care if this lives forever, but when the kids' High School Musical DVDs finally become too scratched to play, this should be waiting in the wings.",Fresh
"The title song from Fame begins, ""Baby, look at me/And tell me what you see."" I'll bite, baby: I see a faithful remake that is worse than the original in almost every respect.",Rotten
"The picture is fitfully effective, but the story disappears in the editing bay. The movie has about as much heft as watching jesters and fire eaters at a village fair.",Rotten
"Fame offers slick entertainment with some exuberance, but it's devoid of soul or heart.",Rotten
"Pleasant, undemanding entertainment for drama-club kids and the people who love them -- a family-friendly salute to young performing artists.",Fresh

But its well-intentioned message and some likeable characters mean the teenage target audience should find plenty to enjoy.,Fresh
"The cinematic equivalent of America's Got Talent... Sadly, though, there is no Simon Cowell - and more importantly, no red buzzer.",Rotten
Unconnected shreds of plot suggest severe editing at some stage and neither characters nor musical routines add up to much.,Rotten
The world has hardly been breathlessly awaiting a new version of Fame and an older generation will probably find it uncomfortably corny with showbusiness schmaltz smoothing away the rougher edges of the more adult original.,Rotten
"In addition to the movie's general awfulness, there's an undercurrent of contempt toward the women characters.",Rotten
"The film does deliver a commendable message about the importance of talent and hard work as opposed to instant, Pop Idol-style celebrity.",Fresh
"[Its] hyperreal documentary quality is combined with a borderline fantasy feeling, which will probably drive some literal-minded viewers up the wall, but which is actually the movie's best element and its one claim to distinction.",Fresh
"Suffers from a surfeit of flash, it nonetheless offers the undeniable power of young performers pursuing art at peak dexterity.",Fresh
"NYC high school students sing, dance, emote in acting classes, and otherwise insist that America's got talent, but this unnecessarily tepid, conservative remake of 1980's far more famous and affecting original Fame suggests otherwise.",Rotten
"'Lame!' would be a better title for this utterly unmemorable remake of Alan Parker's edgier, darker, remarkably fresh 1980 multi-Oscar-winner.",Rotten
"Fame 2009 has turns rather than scenes, and its interchangeable students don't have names to remember so much as tags: ""angry"", ""nervy"", ""blonde"". Most can sing or dance, though the relentless exhibitionism grows tiring.",Rotten
The new remake of the 1980 hit 'Fame' is not going to live forever and has clearly not learned how to fly.,Rotten
"Remakes generally get compared to the originals and sometimes, as in this case, they don't measure up",Rotten
"This is not, in any sense, an accurate depiction of life at an arts school. It's a giant MTV VMAs performance.",Rotten
"...despite cliched characters and parents straight from central casting, the performance numbers are executed by some pretty talented kids and Megan Mullally and Bebe Neuwirth are intriguing as the school's singing and dance instructors.",Fresh
"The devotion to the PG rating is damning, because 8 p.m. shows airing on ABC Family can be edgier and more topical than the new ""Fame.""",Rotten
"A terrific score coupled with exciting choreography, tight editing and a talented cast make Fame a joyous and upbeat experience.",Fresh
The movie is salvaged by a few well-choreographed dance numbers and some signature songs. The movie is geared to fans of MTV videos with short attention spans.,Rotten
"To me, this updating of the original 'Fame' beautifully highlights the joys and heartbreaks that come with dedication to the performing arts.",Fresh
"Burnett's script almost sinks Fame, but the voice of Naturi Naughton, the heart of Dutton, and the energy of Tancharoen give it a pulse. Fame is erratic, but it definitely has a beat.",Fresh
