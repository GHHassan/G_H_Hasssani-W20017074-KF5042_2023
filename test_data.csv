Sit through the roller coaster plot and enjoy Craven doing what he does best,Rotten
There's nothing here that's remotely spooky or creepy or compelling. This is simply one of the most inert horror films I've ever seen.,Rotten
"It's telling that one of the giddiest scenes (a lycanthropy-powered wrestling match), reaches for inspiration from Teen Wolf Too.",Rotten
"Cursed may as well be retitled Guilty Pleasure, because that's exactly what it is.",Fresh
"Not what you'd expect from the makers of the Scream movies, but it still has it moments; not a lot of them, but a few.",Fresh
"Before it was reworked for a PG-13 it might have been a more interesting movie than the lame, tame and more of the same werewolf yarn that skulked into theaters last week.",Rotten
not quite edgy enough to be cool and it's certainly nowhere near scary enough for most horror fans,Rotten
"Makes you long for the days when teenage werewolves were beady-eyed, slavering versions of hairy-palm jokes.",Rotten
"Poor special effects, a silly looking werewolf and clunky comic writing help to spoil what should have been a fun B-movie.",Rotten
The scariest thing in the movie is a cameo by Scott Baio.,Rotten
"Still, no movie starring Ricci has ever been a total waste - if you're curious, it will be worth a three-buck DVD rental in a few months.",Rotten
It's fun watching the horror conventions unfold though Craven's skillful camera.,Fresh
A stylish and fun homage to a classic horror subgenre.,Fresh
"However flawed this screamer may be, it's still Wes Craven!",Rotten
The Weinsteins screw Craven out of a possibly great horror film.,Rotten
"Messy and disconnected, not scary but not really funny, and nearly completely uninteresting.",Rotten
bears all the hallmarks of a film that has been worked and reworked and reworked again,Rotten
Genre fans and newcomers alike should skip this monstrosity and go rent Ginger Snaps instead.,Rotten
"Christina Ricci wanders around unleashed in a moon-eyed daze, wondering who let this dog out.",Rotten
"When the violence-filled, snarling creature-fest appears to be over, there's another act to go. It should have quit when it was almost a hoot.",Rotten
A werewolf howler with no bite or bark. It's completely scream-free.,Rotten
Cursed opens with a fortune teller bearing bad news.,Rotten
They weren't just scraping the bottom of the barrel here; they were lifting it up to see what gunk clung to its mouldy base.,Rotten
"... the real cursed are ticket buyers expecting a scary ride, which they won't get.",Rotten
"Cursed is no Scream, but it is at least a healthy yelp.",Fresh
There are so many contemptuous things to say about this disastrous Teen Wolf/Lost Boys clone that I'm not sure where to begin.,Rotten
"All of this could have been loose, kitschy fun, but ""Cursed"" is too self-conscious to get off the ground.",Rotten
Cursed feels like a series of curveballs designed to confuse the audience into thinking they're watching anything other than bad dialogue.,Rotten
They band together to combat the curse of these unnatural impulses and strike out to kill their original attacker in hopes of saving themselves.,Rotten
"If this is the way Craven is headed, we should be mourning the loss of a true talent.",Rotten
"a confusing mess, occasionally funny, but with hardly enough bite to get you howling",Rotten
Watchable horror film has good performances and several nice moments but it's let down by some dodgy CGI and a patchy script.,Rotten
Subestima a inteligncia do espectador do incio ao fim e apela para todo tipo de clich de direo para tentar provocar sustos ocasionais.,Rotten
"It's disheartening to see three so extraordinary talents as Craven, Williamson, and Ricci create so distinctly ordinary a product. (Unrated Version)",Rotten
...boredom never quite sets in thanks to the engaging performances...,Fresh
film whose authors require so many excuses doesn't deserve an audience,Rotten
"Until this past Friday, the worst werewolf film ever made was, hairy hands down, Mike Nichols' Wolf. Cursed now assumes that dubious distinction and someone is going to have to try very hard to wrestle it away.",Fresh
"A procession of silly startlements: a sudden loud sound here, a mysterious hand creeping in there. This isn't scary, it's irritating. And then it's tiresome.",Rotten
full review in Greek,Rotten
"It really never deserved to be more than a quickie TV-movie on the WB, where it would've aired around Halloween and then faded into oblivion.",Rotten

Dumb werewolf movie may leave you feeling cursed.,Rotten
"Curse is hip, modern and simple as it retells the classic werewolf legend.",Fresh
Cursed just makes me sad.,Rotten
"Takes the tried-and-true route of bullies, PG-rated house parties, nerd-dunking, ""That's my boy"" winking, and vapid teen romance.",Rotten
A likable mix of laughs and wacky action sequences.,Fresh
"While there's little substance in front of the camera, there's somehow less behind it.",Rotten
Any time you can get the strong chins of Bruce Campbell and Kurt Russell in a movie together you should.,Fresh
A derivative and unappealing comedy about superheroes and their sidekicks in training.,Rotten
"The flick is best in its bittier moments (watch for the stellar cameos), and there's nothing to trouble the tots.",Fresh
"Silly and sweet, Sky High is a delightfully over-the-top kids' movie that is a good antidote for the typically pretentious super hero picture.",Fresh
"I had a ball with Sky High, and I suspect that lots of stunned moviegoers are going to walk out of the flick feeling the exact same way.",Fresh
"Disney's kid flick about a superhero high school isn't groundbreaking, but it is great family fun with a strong cast and a nice sense of entertainment.",Fresh
"The humor is not necessarily subversive, but it is often subtle and cleverly conceived, which is a super feat indeed.",Fresh
The film struggles constantly just to maintain mediocrity.,Rotten
"It's Harry Potter meets The Incredibles - the memorable characters, hearty laughs, great writing and all around movie goodness.",Rotten
"a dull, kid-friendly regurgitation of readily available (and superior) iconographic comics",Rotten
"Mike Mitchell directs scenes in big, bright comic-strip panels: colorful and exaggerated, with everything spelled out in veritable word balloons.",Rotten
a lively and lightweight adventure that finds the elusive middle ground between comedy and comic-book heroics that the makers of 'Fantastic Four' never did.,Fresh
"Although it aims for Spy Kids and The Incredibles territory, this family entertainment is strictly for those too young to attend the titular institution.",Rotten
Director Mike Mitchell deftly blends two genres -- the high school romance and the special-effects-laden superhero comic book adaptation -- and manages to spoof yet salute both with a refreshing lack of pretension.,Fresh
"This zippy Disney adventure-comedy asks that age-old question, 'Is there life after high school?,' and answers it with a cheerful 'Not really.'",Fresh
An amiable and satisfying romp that will put a smile on the face of viewers young and old.,Fresh
Sky High is too hopelessly contrived for its actors to be able to make it work.,Rotten
This movie about a high school for superheroes is so good-natured and self-deprecating that it's virtually impossible to dislike the thing.,Fresh
It cleverly puts the perils of adolescence on the same level with fights against monsters and giant robots and bad guys who want to take over the world.,Fresh
The creators of Sky High have their finger expertly placed on their movie's pulse.,Fresh
The clever script finds the fun while Michael Angarano keeps the emotions real as a kid who learns that real friends don't care if you're a star.,Fresh
"Confident and strong, directed with enough of an edge to be interesting, written with heart and a genuine wit.",Fresh
"A brightly entertaining teenage comedy as frothy and predictable as cotton candy, but also just as sweet.",Fresh
Sky High is a diverting family comedy that at its best aims to be a live-action Incredibles and at its middling a live-action episode of Kim Possible.,Fresh
"By today's whiz-bang standards, may seem a tad tame and old-fashioned, but it's a harmless trifle whose easy-going, undemanding tone should appeal to younger viewers.",Fresh
"Sky High doesn't make any big statements. In fact, modesty is a big part of its appeal - even its cheesy special effects add to the warm, homey quality it strives for and achieves.",Fresh
"Worried it might be redundant given Incredibles? Worry Not. Sky High stands mightily on its own, albeit employing a standard formula. I had a great time.",Fresh
...avoids originality as if it were an infectious disease.,Rotten
"A lighthearted, albeit sanitized, teen movie that marries 1960s kitsch to 1980s angst with sharp one-liners, sight gags and a lunatic-fringe supporting cast of comedians.",Fresh
"Sky High is funny, smart, energetic, subversive, and has a few substantive things to say.",Fresh
A clich-dependent Disney cheapy that aims no higher than the unsophisticated standards of its pre-adolescent target audience -- and somehow succeeds in spite of itself.,Fresh
Bright colors contrast the usual superhero dark mode. That's a +. But a script-by-committee turns Sky High into a John Hughes high school clone.,Rotten
Merely child's play.,Rotten
"Smartly written and sprightly played, Sky High satisfies with a clever commingling of spoofy superheroics, school-daze hijinks, and family friendly coming-of-age dramedy.",Fresh
Flying High on fun. Superhero teenage movie hilarious.,Fresh
Harmless family comedy with welcomely loopy asides.,Fresh
A didactic Disney kiddie comedy that filters run-of-the-mill high school through comic-book superhero conventions.,Rotten
"Funny, clever and even a bit inspirational, hinting at the potential for heroism in all of us.",Fresh
"With a crisp and snappy visual style and its smartly paced story, Sky High pulls an incredible feat in an age of dumbed-down kids comedies; it's as down-to-earth as it is super.",Fresh
Sky High may set a record for ripping off more movies in just over an hour and a half than any other film in history.,Rotten
The formula fizzles when you skimp on the ingredients. Sky High never achieves liftoff.,Rotten
Sky High is a blast-off into good fun for the kids.,Fresh
Takes camp to new levels of self-aware mediocrity.,Rotten
An engaging and surprisingly sharp allegory about high-school hierarchies and adolescent growing pains.,Fresh
"A good-natured and witty mix of two modern film genres, Sky High is classic Disney filmmaking -- fanciful, family-friendly and, most importantly, fun.",Fresh
"To be honest, the whole thing looks a bit like an episode of television's Power Rangers.",Rotten
"Less discriminating, younger viewers may find Sky High amusing, but actual high school students are way beyond this kid stuff.",Rotten
"Cheesy as it is, the family comedy Sky High doesn't even approximate the texture of Kraft plastic-wrapped singles.",Rotten
"This is, indeed, another teen flick, a spotty, stodgily directed, though occasionally clever one, with several cardboard performances.",Rotten
"The climax, which involves the homecoming dance and a death ray, is frenzied in its effort to entertain, yet ultimately underwhelming, much like the movie as a whole.",Rotten
"Yes, the idea sounds derivative -- 'The Incredibles Go to Hogwarts' -- but [the] script spins that idea into interesting configurations.",Fresh
"High school sucks, especially when the bullies can toss you from wall to wall or throw fireballs.",Rotten
The movie offers good-spirited fun with a family tilt.,Fresh
"A clever, cotton-candy- light self-parody to the superhero genre that's both effective and refreshing.",Fresh
Surprisingly fresh and entertaining.,Fresh
Sky High hasn't a single original idea in its bird brain.,Rotten
"High schoolers (who are shown chugging only soda pop at a supposedly rowdy party) will rule this movie lame, though early grade-schoolers might bite.",Rotten
"This is essentially an innocuous Disney gimmick movie, not entirely juvenile but still completely dependent on formula.",Rotten
"Squeaky clean, but not to a nauseating degree, Sky High is engaging enough for the whole family to enjoy.",Rotten
"There's nary an original bone in its cinematic body... and it is movie-licious nevertheless: very clever and visually hilarious, it's a simple, charming delight.",Fresh
"If you thought Hogwarts was the only secret school for extraordinary kids, welcome to the amusing, yet cheesy Sky High.",Rotten
Sky High soars,Fresh
Dissatisfying to an adult audience accustomed to more sophisticated parody....will resonate with young viewers on their way to high school.,Rotten
... A potentially puerile Disney movie turned into something we all can enjoy.,Fresh
A not-so-subtle metaphor about popularity and puberty.,Fresh
Director Mike Mitchell and his writing team have a lot of fun tweaking the conventions of the contemporary teen movie.,Fresh
"The Incredibles it ain't, but Sky High will do nicely.",Fresh
A family-friendly and legitimately enjoyable Disney flick.,Fresh
'Sky High' includes enough funny scenes and colorful characters to hold the interest of adults and youngsters alike.,Fresh
"We've already had ""The Incredibles,"" ""Harry Potter"" and a half a dozen other films in similar veins over the past couple of years. We don't need this.",Rotten
It is subversive enough for kids to enjoy and mild enough that parents won't feel threatened.,Fresh
"...an unexpected treat, crossing the superhero saga with the teenage 'coming of age' comedy. It's a clever and often surprising mix that works.",Fresh
"Because Sky High opens with a fantastically entertaining half hour, it's hard not to be disappointed when the film morphs into a routine high school drama...",Fresh
"It's inoffensive and sports a positive 'be yourself' message that's obvious enough to be seen from space without benefit of hero-vision, but really, there's very little that's super about it.",Rotten
The film makes up for the paper thin clichd story-line by having fun with superhero mythology.,Fresh
"It's definitely for the kids, but there's enough in it to make it a watchable diversion for the rest of us.",Fresh
"Sky High is not quite what it could have been, but its positive attributes manage to overcome the villainous forces of boredom and lameness.",Fresh
"Quaint, but funny, a clever and well-acted story plugged into a worn formula.",Fresh
Exaggeration works for Sky High.,Fresh
"Any film about superheroes should be redundant but this movie offers a fresh, new take",Fresh
"It's the sort of kid's fare that parents love to get: genuinely smart, genuinely funny, genuinely fun all around.",Fresh
"Unfortunately, there's too much deadweight in this listless, unfunny dreck - and it starts with the lead.",Rotten
"[A] pure, sweet pleasure ... It's fun. And given its baldly hybrid premise, that's pretty super in itself.",Fresh
... un film de Disney avec juste un tout petit peu + de mordant qu' l'habitude.,Fresh
My 12-year-old self would have liked this movie a lot. The 25-year-old me likes it a bit more than he cares to admit.,Fresh
"There's nothing groundbreaking here, yet the film is light and fun, and there's a positive message for kids.",Fresh
A pleasant enough collection of derivative predictability that's not without some minor charm of its own.,Fresh
"a winning combination of teen melodrama, quirky characters and superhero fantasy, almost tailor made for a long run as a Saturday morning TV show on the Disney Channel.",Fresh
"A very bright, amiable, warmhearted Disney family film that is hard not to like.",Fresh
"Finally, a summer family film that can (and did) hold the attention of my 5-year-old nephew without getting me in trouble with his parents.",Fresh
"Witty, wacky and played with conviction...Sky High soars with a vigor missing from 95% of movies released so far this year.",Fresh
"Stan Lee might not approve, but the script, by newcomer Paul Hernandez and Kim Possible creators Mark McCorkle and Bob Schooley, gets off some good lines",Fresh
Hogwarts for superheroes - the best family film of the year. Miss it at your peril; you never know how many super-villains are living on your street.,Fresh
In Sky High normalcy gets equated with privilege: This is teenage angst and competition as the kids of bigwig Hollywood players must have experienced it.,Rotten
"I anticipated going to this movie with a dread that was nearly ""Sky High."" But what a pleasant surprise!",Fresh
"Bright and eager to please, it reworks themes and situations from teen films of a generation ago in a manner that makes a surprising amount of sense today.",Fresh
There are enough characters in the clean cut satire 'Sky High' to spin-off a dozen Saturday morning TV series.,Fresh
This inventive superhero movie hybrid (The Incredibles meet the X-men via Harry Potter) is one of the most entertaining family films of the summer.,Fresh
"...as far as bringing a superhero angle to the real world, the Spider-Man franchise has done a more convincing job than this sitcom approach.",Rotten
"I never thought I'd say it, but I can't wait until this is turned into a TV series...",Fresh
"While originality is hardly the film's strongest suit, its agreeable mix of knowing spoof and kid-pleasing fantasy makes it considerably more engaging than some of the 'straight' superhero blockbusters we've suffered recently.",Fresh
"Even though Sky High is aimed at kids, everyone else should see it.",Fresh
"The script crackles with funny, quotable dialogue and the plot has a lot of fun with the usual teen movie staples.",Fresh
"Sky High pokes gentle fun at growing up, entering a new school, joining cliques, adjusting to friends and parents, dealing with peer pressure, and learning who you are.",Fresh
"...A movie based on a high school for super-powered teens may not have seemed like the savviest idea. Fortunately, Sky High isn't bad. In fact, it's surprisingly good.",Fresh
the film adds a superior level of irreverence that reminds me of films like Galaxy Quest.,Fresh
Carefully pitched to be watchable by the Breakfast Club generation and their young kids.,Fresh
"Sky High is adolescent, in the best, age-appropriate sense of the word; it's like a John Hughes movie, but for tweens.",Fresh
"It might be aimed at teens, but Sky High is fun for parents, too.",Fresh
"Here, teen empowerment takes on a very literal form, even if events never stray far from the world as envisaged in a John Hughes movie.",Fresh
Just kind of a mildly entertaining footnote.,Fresh
"I'm a sucker for comic book movies, and ""Sky High"" won me over...",Fresh
"...achieves a miraculous level of kitchy zip thanks to its creative casting of Kurt Russell, Lynda Carter, and Bruce Campbell.",Fresh
"surprisingly clever, spirited and joyful",Fresh
Cartoony high school superhero drama; OK for tweens.,Fresh
"Sky High is the latest Disney teen comedy about the pitfalls of adolescent life, but is much, much better than it seems like it should be in large part due to its strong cast and assured direction.",Fresh
"A snappy, knowing genre experiment.",Fresh
The special effects are definitely hokey but I feel like it fits for this kind of film.,Fresh
A pretty harmless family comedy.,Rotten
"In a summer with few surprises, Sky High proves to be a buried treasure -- a clever take on the teen-high school genre.",Fresh
"Numbingly simplistic adaptation of Farley Mowat's short story, 'Walk Well My Brother.'",Rotten
"Constant interruptions prevent the story from building to a satisfying emotional pitch, leaving the film, like the characters, to trudge circuitously across that vast frozen tundra.",Rotten
"Smith's respect and love for the wilderness is clear in every frame, and allows the viewer to become fully immersed in the characters' predicaments.",Fresh
"The Snow Walker is not Atanarjuat, but it captures the actual scenic beauty of the North and with it, the poetic truth of brotherhood in an unforgiving land.",Fresh
"The Snow Walker is a powerful, poignant and transcendent film.",Fresh
"As predicable as the annual fall of the Maple Leafs, but considerably more tragic, as traditional as the recurring scam of political patronage, but a lot more compelling, The Snow Walker is a vintage slice of Canadiana.",Fresh
"...given the skill with which this spare story has been filmed, it's hard not to be entertained on some level.",Fresh
"Atravs das belssimas atuaes de Pepper e da estreante Piugattuk, a narrativa desenvolve-se com calma at atingir um clmax emocional inesperado, mas eficiente.",Fresh
An old school adventure whose simple themes resonate with a refreshing honesty.,Fresh
Arctic authenticity makes up for the false notes.,Fresh
Give it a whirl after you turn up the heat,Fresh
[A]voids descending into the overtly sentimental by not romanticizing a harsh land...,Fresh
"If you're planning on hitting the crack-pipe this weekend, then here's a good side dish.",Rotten
...three or four bits of high-end grue surrounded by a whole lot of white noise.,Rotten
...it's hard to imagine anyone walking away from the film satisfied (this includes the folks responsible for making the movie).,Rotten
good ending that can't save generally disappointing film,Rotten
"It has a nice little array of second tier actors, an interesting story, and a convincing performance by Jensen Ackles who keeps the movie afloat with enough competence to render him likable, even if it's genre confused as all hell...",Fresh
The film let's us know early on that its cyberdrama will be served cold.,Rotten
So much to work with and all of it tossed in favor of banal platitudes and a star-crossed romance with all the tension of an oil-change and all the gravitas of an Archie comic,Rotten
"For all the movie's impressive figure and facial modeling, as well as the superfluid humanoid motion, any depth is purely an illusion.",Rotten
"The supposedly human face of our metal-plated robocop's partner -- the inevitable curvy female in a leather jump suit -- is an inexpressive, glossy doll mask, untouched by human hands.",Rotten
"Even in a cartoon this technically astounding, most of the characters appear to have sprung from the DNA of Astro Boy.",Rotten
A visual marvel.,Fresh
"Dazzling visually but is flattened by corny dialogue better suited to the 1936 Flash Gordon serial, a needlessly hard to follow plot and heavy-handed exposition clotted with pseudo-scientific mumbo jumbo.",Rotten
Has a plot that frolics in the no-man's land between fiendish complexity and utter incomprehensibility.,Rotten
"Despite swaths of verbal exposition and a tendency to overdose on robot action sequences, the film has enough originality to interest demanding fans of the genre.",Fresh
The bizarre gulf between the realism of the backgrounds and the stylization of the characters undermines a story line about a conspiracy to rid Utopia of 'bio-roids.',Rotten
The spectacle of the Appleseed anime characters performing Matrix gymnastics proves to be less than awe-inspiring.,Rotten
"In the clash of 2-D and 3-D images, Appleseed emerges as the cracked-voiced, pasty-faced example of computer animation's clumsy adolescence.",Rotten
"With so much going on in every frame, Appleseed is one of those anime projects that shouts you to sleep.",Rotten
"There's a little too much talking and not as many battle scenes as we would've liked, but Appleseed is still a decent pick.",Fresh
"Unfortunately, the story is painfully recycled, heavily indebted to Blade Runner (1982), along with healthy dollops of Beauty and the Beast, Isaac Asimov's robot stories and the mythological echoes.",Rotten
"Yes, it looks good, but it doesn't come close to exploring the grand themes it has in mind, or to ascending anywhere near the landmarks of anime.",Rotten
A cross-pollination of eye-popping combat and provocative ideas.,Fresh
"The action scenes might grab you, but there's a lot of talky downtime.",Rotten
"Though Appleseed has its selling points, it's not an especially strong entry in the genre, despite the presence of so many pneumatic heroines.",Rotten
This long-overdue big-screen adaptation makes it hard to tell what was so revolutionary about the series.,Rotten
"[A] warrior babe cradles [an] injured cyborg bunny in her arms and weeps for him. Take that, Hotel Rwanda!",Rotten
"The filmmakers are too busy trying to justify their futuristic world, and not enough actually exploring it.",Rotten
Newbie viewers will be left twiddling their thumbs while waiting for Deunen's next bout of butt-kicking action sequences.,Rotten
"With all that gorgeous imagery, you'd think the filmmakers would have found a way to tell the story visually without using mountains of expositional dialogue.",Rotten
There is plenty to admire from a technical and artistic standpoint.,Fresh
"It's an impressive effort, packed with ideas and good action scenes, but still trots out a clichd plot about a super-soldier babe, a race of meek artificial people, giant robot suits, confusing conspiracies and a lot of explosions.",Rotten
"It's busy, stiff, artificial graphics are a perfect match for its busy, stiff, artificial plot.",Rotten
Shut your brain down for optimal viewing pleasure.,Fresh
The stock characters and leaden stretches of expository dialogue are welcome evidence that there's still no computer program capable of telling a decent story.,Rotten
the viewer who abstracts away from the more adolescent elements of plot will find that Appleseed has plenty of ideas at its core to keep the mind stimulated.,Fresh
I really wish I could have liked this more.,Rotten
"It's an exceedingly brilliant combination of future shock set-up and old school moralizing, a deconstruction of what it means to be human rendered in tech tones so slick that you often forget you're watching a cartoon.",Fresh
"Breck Eisner's youthful, fresh grasp of the high-adventure genre. This should have been his audition reel for helming 007/21.",Fresh
"As Hollywood actioners go these days, this one's quite tolerable in its guilty-pleasure way. Feel free to saddle up.",Fresh
A blockbuster played by action figures and written by children.,Rotten
Highly entertaining romp from the pen of airport pulp king Clive Cussler.,Fresh
A surprisingly fun action comedy with a cast that connects.,Fresh
"This perfectly distracting, ultimately unsatisfying film feels like a James Bond flick in which the stand-in got the lead.",Rotten
"If Sahara weren't quite so dumb, it might have been a lot of fun.",Rotten
"The whole concept is just too stupid to go along with, and would make the movie bad enough on its own if it wasn't a contender for the most racist film ever made.",Rotten
"Steve Zahn rocks! Though at times the film certainly stretches the believability factor, it is always engaging, always fun.",Fresh
"Insanely busy, exceedingly long, and sometimes endearingly preposterous.",Rotten
"This is a big, lively romp, filmed in a lushly expansive epic style even though it's basically low-rent James Bond.",Fresh
"No one seems to know what they're doing, or worse, much care.",Rotten
This is what action movie should be... Dirk Pitt is a hero who would make James Bond buy him a drink and make XXX wet his pants.,Fresh
"A little Indiana Jones, a little James Bond, a little Tom Clancy -- it all adds up to an action-adventure flick with little to distinguish it.",Rotten
It's nothing more than a mirage of fleeting potential and topless Matthew McConaughey shots.,Rotten
Second-rate adventure.,Rotten
"A little inventiveness is one thing, but this movie strains credibility at every turn.",Rotten
"We get it, guys...there's a treasure in the desert...just get to it already!!",Rotten
"Sahara won't be competing for any Oscars, but it is goofy, light-hearted fun.",Fresh
"The most exciting adventure based on a third-rate paperback and directed by the son of a movie mogul ever produced! Which is to say, not actually exciting at all.",Rotten
"Sahara isn't exactly a prestigious Merchant-Ivory production, and it doesn't pretend to be. Meet it on its level of entertainment, and a good time is sure to be had.",Fresh
Sahara is such an enigmatic piece of filmmaking that it never settles on a tone and whose downtime in-between the action is going to ease audiences into a gentle slumber.,Rotten
It's no wonder the highly mechanized finished product feels so unfulfilling,Rotten
Eisner shows himself to be a solid helmer of complex and beautifully staged action sequences with a sure ear for character interplay and an exact eye for glorious widescreen framing with nods to images from Lawrence of Arabia.,Fresh
A testosterone-drenched escapade that misses because it lacks the tension to make it a thrill ride.,Rotten
It's a little hard to have silly fun when you are constantly being reminded that Hotel Rwanda and similar stories have been playing out down the road.,Rotten
"The casting is so strong and the overall filmmaking flair of the movie is so captivating that it basically works, perhaps even well enough to join its producer Mace Neufeld's Tom Clancy adaptations as a major new movie franchise.",Fresh
"Getting the girl, finding the gold and saving the world from a plague are just afterthoughts here. The main objective is to have fun, and in that regard, Sahara accomplishes its mission handily.",Fresh
"Believable? Nah. But when a movie is this fun, who cares?",Fresh
"A largely entertaining version of Clive Cussler's novel, with Matthew McConaughey delivering the goods as the adventurous Dirk Pitt.",Fresh
Even the brain-dead National Treasure tried harder than this.,Rotten
"The movie, first preposterously entertaining and then just preposterous, makes James Bond films look as logical as Euclidean geometry.",Rotten
"We flip through the usual catalog of close-call explosions, firefights and chases in which the weaponry is as lovingly photographed as the bronzed McConaughey and gorgeous Cruz.",Rotten
Feels like a carbon copy of the real thing.,Rotten
"If you like movies that are big, dumb fun, they don't come much bigger -- and they certainly don't come any dumber (or funner!) -- than Sahara.",Fresh
"For people thirsty for the kind of sub-Indiana Jones adventure that used to pop up on your local UHF stations all weekend long, Sahara fills a real niche.",Fresh
As dry and lifeless as its sun-burnt locale.,Rotten
"The plot flies in too many directions, and the derring-do stunts are ho-hum.",Rotten
Spectacularly silly and perversely entertaining.,Fresh
"It may not be Raiders of the Lost Ark, but Sahara, the screen adaptation of Clive Cussler's sprawling African adventure yarn, is a movie that keeps half a brain in its head while adopting the amused, cocky smirk of the Indiana Jones romps.",Fresh
The secret ingredient that makes this handsome thriller so enjoyable is the chemistry between Alpha-male McConaughey and zany Zahn.,Fresh
"The film is passably entertaining, in no small part because of Steve Zahn.",Fresh
"The characters are too thin, the violence too careless, the suspension of disbelief required too strenuous, the treatment of non-whites too stereotyped.",Rotten
Was Matthew McConaughey invited to the congressional hearings on steroids?,Rotten
"Brainless...but it's also breathless. If the content is negligible and even puerile, the packaging is choice.",Fresh
"Mightily agreeable foolishness ... one of the few cases where the phrase, ""the book was better,"" actually doesn't apply.",Fresh
"Travels down been-there-done-that territory, afraid to take chances and unaware of its own tedious mediocrity.",Rotten
"How seriously can you take a movie in which Penelope Cruz, wearing a bucket of eye make-up, plays a World Health Organization physician who investigates plagues?",Rotten
"Although the movie isn't great, it is kinda fun.",Fresh
"When Sahara stops being about Dirk and Al's misadventures and starts being about viruses and mass murder, it loses its way.",Rotten
There's no disguising the fact that Sahara has all the heft of marshmallow.,Rotten
This is a Mystery Science Theater 3000 special.,Rotten
Feels as plodding and fruitless as trekking the length of a desert on a pogo stick with a busted spring.,Rotten
"What it is is a big summer action movie that would have been hot stuff about 30 years ago but looks tired and worn today despite a perky, attractive cast that refuses to wilt in the desert sun.",Rotten
"A big, goofy, entirely disposable, tons-o-fun Hollywood Action Flick.",Fresh
How many leaps of logic do you allow an action movie before that thin strand of suspended disbelief snaps?,Rotten
"Clive Cussler needs to calm down and quit complaining. As silly, mindless pieces of entertainment go, Sahara is fine, and the perfect adaptation of a Cussler book.",Fresh
"The film's greatest secret weapon is its hip, young cast.",Fresh
100 percent of its character development takes place in the opening credit montage.,Rotten
McConaughey's no Harrison Ford. And no one cracks the whip of originality.,Rotten
"A mediocrity wrapped inside a banality, toasted in a nice, fresh cliche.",Rotten
You have to question the wisdom of optioning a Cussler book and hiring a pack of writers to transform it into generic drivel -- surely it would have been cheaper to commission original claptrap.,Rotten
"Unlike Raiders of the Lost Ark, which this movie wants so desperately to be, there's nothing here to engage the brain along with the eyeballs.",Rotten
Entertaining but flawed popcorn fare.,Fresh
"This one has everything: stereotyped characters, shaky camera work, absurdly inappropriate pop songs on the soundtrack, a confused tone, misplaced zaniness and a nonsensical story.",Rotten
A silly and morally vacant movie.,Rotten
Offers action-adventure as enjoyable as it is preposterous.,Fresh
"Just when the silliness seems too much, viewers get distracted by the amusing antics of a first-rate supporting cast.",Fresh
"Mostly, the movie seems to exist as an excuse to blow things up and rig massive stunts.",Rotten
"The movie is based on a novel by Cussler, who's reportedly sued the movie on the grounds that he was promised and denied ultimate script approval. More's the pity. He'd surely have given us an ironclad ending.",Rotten
Let's hope today's 10-year-old boys aren't too jaded by Matrix reruns to enjoy this for the good clean fun that it is.,Fresh
McConaughey and Zahn's casual interplay makes the film.,Fresh
"Productions this guiltlessly corny need real personalities to sell them, and unlike the dull National Treasure, Sahara has a few.",Fresh
"The one-liners, mostly bland, are used so liberally that they water down the action.",Rotten
Eisner is not remotely up to the challenge. Spending millions on action scenes does not mean you get them right.,Rotten
A mediocre action-adventure flick that's compelling only for its strange mixture of B-movie elements and a completely hollow social consciousness.,Rotten
The final product is more like a collection of genre clichs than a compelling story.,Rotten
"With Matthew McConaughey in the lead role, there is plenty of dash, lots of adventure and just enough sex appeal.",Fresh
"It's about good ol' boys on a rip-snorting adventure, and to that end, it succeeds.",Fresh
"A couple of action scenes are a little less thrilling than promised, but McConaughey's cowboy strut can sell the snake oil he's peddling.",Fresh
"What little humor Sahara has is forced, and of the goofy, 'buddy-film' shenanigans variety.",Rotten
Stands as one more bit of throwback entertainment that's better than I expected -- and not much more.,Fresh
"Dirk is less the ""adventurer"" of the novels than a very tanned, very bland former Navy SEAL/current treasure hunter/archaeologist, the average capitalist yahoo.",Rotten
"McConaughey and his co-stars make the case that fun, however fleeting, is still fun.",Fresh
"As action-adventures go, Sahara may not be as close to the tradition of Indiana Jones as it wants to be, but it is still slightly better than average.",Fresh
"Whatever it lacks in substance it makes up for in gloss, humor and thrills, and a good time should be had by all.",Fresh
"The filmmakers move between their two lesser plots with a motley assortment of plot holes, contrivances and fantastically preposterous leaps which grow more and more incredulous as the film progresses.",Rotten
"Good-natured enough to entertain here and there, but that otherwise loses its way long before the characters complete their implausible quest.",Rotten
"Then again, women still swoon with lust whenever McConaughey steps in front of the camera, no matter how rancid is the project he deems fit to appear in right now.",Rotten
"As barren as the actual Sahara, but without the grand lure, this movie is plain old stoo-pid...",Rotten
"For a popcorn movie, it's a bit stale.",Rotten
"Not quite as fun as ""National Treasure,"" but far better than Dennis Quaid's doomed ""Flight of the Phoenix.""",Fresh
"I enjoyed this movie on its own dumb level, which must mean (I am forced to conclude) in my own dumb way.",Fresh
Is it cheesy fun or just cheesy? Just cheesy.,Rotten
"With a running time of a few minutes over two hours, Sahara sputters along as slowly as a trek across the desert.",Rotten
[M]ight actually be worthy of licking the boots of Raiders of the Lost Ark...,Fresh
"Sahara falls into quicksand and quickly disappears into the abyss that can only be described as Movie Hell. Only one word can describe this thing, baby: Craptacular.",Rotten
Sahara is pretty to look at but lacks the adrenaline charge of the movies it's so obviously trying to emulate.,Rotten
Matthew McConaughey ... makes a bid to become the next swashbuckling matinee idol. Not that there's much swash to buckle in the middle of the world's largest desert.,Rotten
"For all its flaws, Sahara still works as a C+ discount-matinee time-waster.",Fresh
"'National Treasure Lite'... a movie that would probably be perfect in-flight entertainment, or maybe even a decent video rental on a night when you're in an undemanding mood.",Rotten
Sahara is an Indiana Jones rip-off so dull that it gives me newfound respect for Cannon Films' 1985 version of King Solomon's Mines.,Rotten
Sahara is one of those rare film that is sunk completely as a fault of the cast.... It just goes to show that sometimes Hollywood gets its own formula wrong.,Rotten
It's a pleasure to see a potential franchise develop from such an unlikely source.,Fresh
"As popcorn goes, this one's a value-size box.",Fresh
A marginal adventure story from Clive Cussler's freewheeling novel.,Rotten
The key questions is: Can Matthew McConaughey make Dirk Pitt into another Indiana Jones?,Fresh
One of those action films that require the bad guys to be utterly inept marksmen and feature action sequences that are both implausible and difficult to follow.,Rotten
"Boat chases, gunfights, and stunts galore",Rotten
"A stunning piece of work -- stunningly inept, stunningly incoherent, stunningly awful in every single way imaginable.",Rotten
"In short, Sahara is a hugely enjoyable, old fashioned adventure movie of the sort that they really don't make anymore. It's worth seeing just for the chemistry between its three leads.",Fresh
"Someone had the brilliant idea to treat Sahara as a Hope and Crosby ""Road"" picture pasted onto a James Bond/Indiana Jones plot.",Fresh
"Mindless, but fun and entertaining. It's sort of James Bondish without the ridiculous special effects. I enjoyed it, mainly because of McConaughey and Zahn.",Fresh
The mindless Sahara is smart enough to keep the action and wisecracks at a fevered clip.,Fresh
"Arid as the sand-covered dunes, ""Sahara"" is a made-for-TV flick disguised as the return of Indiana Jones.",Rotten
"While I'd be happy to see another cinematic adventure for Dirk Pitt, I don't ever want to see another Breck Eisner film in my life.",Rotten
"Like a lightweight novel suitable for beach reading, Sahara is mildly entertaining, but I can't recommend it.",Rotten
"From the opening civil war naval battle to the closing credits, I was glued to this film with non-stop action. Don't miss it!",Fresh
It drove me crazy. It made National Treasure look like a documentary.,Rotten
It would have worked better with a funnier and more believable script.,Rotten
"...the overriding lesson here is that if we don't go looking to Matthew McConaughey for gravitas, we'll probably have a good time.",Fresh
The adventures are non-stop but reality gets buried in the sand.,Rotten
"[A]s delightful a bit of... hokum as we've seen in some time. You don't take it seriously for a minute... [Y]ou get a big bag of popcorn, sit back, and enjoy.",Fresh
Has enough humor and adventure that I'm almost willing to overlook the preposterous plot,Rotten
"...an action adventure film, complete with implausible situations, and perfectly timed rescues and escapes. Who cares? It's still fun, exciting and thoroughly entertaining",Fresh
"..a rollicking, wild adventure in which a very buff Matthew McConaughey, and his able sidekick, Steve Zahn, have more fun than any movie pair since Mel Gibson and Danny Glover",Fresh
...will leave a parched sensation in one's dry throat...a recycled buddy-buddy vehicle that's about as welcoming as hugging a cactus tree,Rotten
"While it doesn't rewrite the genre, it finds a way to deliver with style and humor everything adventure fans want.",Fresh
"Sahara is many things, but it is not a movie. It is the skull-splitting cacophony of 21 producers and four screenwriters (that we know about, anyway) standing in the same room shouting into their cell phones.",Rotten
"Otherwise dismissive reviews of Sahara have been forgiving it on the grounds that it's entertaining. Allow me to counter that opinion: No, it isn't.",Rotten
"Pitt seems to get by entirely on dumb ideas and reckless luck. In the end, he's an action hero in name only.",Rotten
"It ain't art, and it's dumber than I'd like, but I don't imagine you were expecting Kieslowski.",Rotten
Sahara has lots of sound and fury trying to cover up for a hopelessly meandering story and a dull hero.,Rotten
McConaughney plays the role of dashing adventurer Dirk Pitt as if he were a party-hardy frat boy who ventured out into the real world after all campus kegs were tapped dry.,Rotten
"Good-natured junk that amuses while it's onscreen, and evaporates almost immediately afterward.",Fresh
"Despite the vast beauty of location settings in Morocco and Spain, the vast lack of chemistry between the two stars is appalling.",Rotten
'...best described as Tom Clancy meets Indiana Jones.',Fresh
"On the occasional moment when McConaughey actually works himself up to being heroic, Sahara positively soars.",Fresh
Easy to look at and even easier to forget.,Rotten
Cussler's attempt to make his concept of an ironclad ship making its way from Richmond to the African desert is no more credible on film than on the written page.,Rotten
"jumps from plotline to plotline, stringing them together with a series of action setpieces that fulfill their obligations, but little more",Rotten
"In one spit-take-inducing moment, our heroes convert a wrecked prop plane into a desert sailboat, which they race across the sand to the strains of 'Magic Carpet Ride.'",Rotten
A hot-buttered popcorn flick that's deserted by its writers in the last act.,Rotten
Sahara is a movie with Indiana Jones aspirations that plays more like a low-rent 007 clone.,Rotten
"Pity, because McConaughey is born to play Pitt. Whether his shirt is on or off (personally I prefer the later) the actor cuts a dashing figure.",Rotten
"A really, really dumb film, but it's lots and lots of fun and entirely lacking in malice.",Fresh
Just don't go expecting complex moral and ethical quandaries and you'll likely never think of Ishtar even once.,Rotten
...nobody could've expected the unbelievable sense of dullness that's permeating every aspect of the film.,Rotten
...like having a swimsuit full of sand.,Rotten
"I can't figure out just what I didn't like about this film, but I know I didn't really enjoy it.",Rotten
With this strong of a cast this film should have been much better.,Rotten
"Sahara's biggest problem is twofold: the film's subtle ideological bent is alarming, and, in the lead, McConaughey is only just barely tolerable.",Rotten
"Like the African desert that lends the film its name, this so-called adventure is coarse, dry, and overheated.",Rotten
"The plotting is too complex for a generally stupid picture, but that didn't stop me from getting sucked in by director Breck Eisner's nicely paced action sequences.",Rotten
It tried to be National Treasure and it failed.,Rotten
"For ""Sahara,"" the problem is that we have the Indiana Jones movies to compare it to, and I'm afraid there's no comparison. It's never more than a likable poseur.",Rotten
"Sahara rather resembles National Treasure, another film with a strained story line and deadening lack of visual richness.",Rotten
"Vapid, lengthy, and mostly lifeless -- kind of like the desert it's named for.",Rotten
"A pretty offensive comedy about Africans who range from primitive to demonic that, sorry, is just not funny.",Rotten
"The whole movie is a kick, actually.",Fresh
"For an adventure movie based on chase scenes in exotic locations ""Sahara"" never takes hold because director Breck Eisner and his team of screenwriters can't agree on what the story's about or what tone should resonate against it.",Rotten
"Anyone with even the slightest awareness of global politics will cringe at dialogue like ""No one cares about Africa"" and the notion that good old fashioned American cunning will always triumph, no matter how dire the circumstances.",Rotten
"To get a franchise going, you need your own style, and this movie hasn't an original thought on anything.",Rotten
"Operating with a machine-tooled efficiency, Sahara seems blithely unaware of its utter predictability.",Rotten
A breezy summer action thriller that knows just what it is and has a ball being just that.,Fresh
A shame this slick vehicle often stalls in a traffic jam of action-adventure cliches and unnecessary mucking about.,Rotten
A strange and rather sick movie made by highly talented people.,Fresh
"A terrific movie, pulled off with a tremendous amount of skill.",Fresh
A middle of the road drama that has a lot going for it in certain key areas.,Fresh
"Neither a great movie nor even a classic noir but it has a great ambition to be daring and, once seen, is not easily forgotten.",Fresh
Power used his almost irritating handsomeness as a subversive tool.,Fresh
One of the odder products of Hollywood's golden age.,Fresh
A cult classic.,Fresh
will haunt you for days,Fresh
"...worth a look, if only for Power's engaging, electrifying performance.",Fresh
"Alongside Todd Browning's Freaks, this is a brilliantly grim assessment of humanity's place in the cruel circus of life.",Fresh
Scripter Jules Furthman and Director Edmund Goulding have ... seldom forgotten that the original novel they were adapting is essentially intelligent trash; and they have never forgotten that on the screen pretty exciting things can be made of trash.,Fresh
"Fly's writing is subtle, believably building upon the small compromises... which create the type of moral vacuum whose creation cannot be understood from the outside.",Fresh
"Don't expect a ""they all lived happily ever after"" tale from helmer and coscripter Per Fly with ""Inheritance.""",Fresh
"Every character trajectory is painfully schematic, and the filmmakers evoke cause-and-effect in the simplest terms possible.",Rotten
"In the end, there's little left in that sad, cold figure at the head of the firm to compel our empathy or compassion.",Rotten
The problems of a CEO nicely dramatized.,Fresh
"This relentlessly morose movie from Denmark is a sleek, desolate fable about the conflict between corporate values and human needs.",Fresh
"Thomsen gives a fully realized, utterly plausible portrayal of a man caught in an untenable dilemma.",Fresh
"The acting is fine, the filmmaking is honest, and the class-conscious story couldn't be more timely.",Fresh
"Striking, often suspenseful.",Fresh
Has a promising start but soon becomes preachy and melodramatic.,Rotten
"The second of a planned trilogy about class divisions, The Inheritance seems to say that money ruins everything. Save yours for another movie.",Rotten
The deft understatement of the actors and the resistance of cinematic artifice make the tale all the more devastating.,Fresh
It traces the difficult and soul-destroying choices that have to be made to transform a failing family business into a potentially monopolistic multinational corporation.,Fresh
An initially insightful portrait of modern corporate society that unfortunately lapses into melodrama.,Rotten
All the great emotions we're used to in the works of Ibsen and Shakespeare wash over us in bountiful flow.,Fresh
The Inheritance offers a more fascinating fictionalized look at what cut-throat capitalism can do to conscience.,Fresh
"As it moves forward, this bleak parable of business and power teases you with possibilities.",Fresh
"It's a poignant, even heart-rending reflection on how doing the right thing isn't as simple as we were once taught.",Fresh
"It's not exactly fun family entertainment, but it is a realistic depiction of a man struggling between family duty and happiness.",Fresh
A dour Danish version of Dynasty without the gloss and glamour but with subtitles.,Rotten
"While the entire movie is one massive flashback, the real reasons for all this Danish dysfunction go unexplored.",Rotten
Fly's heartbreaking drama about a man who inherits a ton of power and buckets of sorrow will tell you all you need to know about the soul-destroying nature of corporate culture.,Fresh
"Highly dramatic and intensely emotional, blessed with strong themes and an unstoppable narrative drive, it is adult, intelligent entertainment of a kind we rarely see these days.",Fresh
Fly's subtle observations about certain elements of the upper class come through with quiet force.,Fresh
"A solid, involving Danish drama that proves discord, struggle and variance need not necessarily be lost in translation.",Fresh
The politics of the story come to life through the vivid characterizations of a uniformly excellent cast.,Fresh
Fly's point is that private morality has public consequences. And this film's major achievement is making us understand just that.,Fresh
"a compelling study of the classic struggle men often have to make in choosing between wife and mother, duty and family, right and wrong.",Fresh
"So much of this Danish-Swedish import is so uninteresting that it quickly becomes a chore to sit through. And that's too bad, because the film has a lot to say about professional- vs.-personal life struggles.",Rotten
"Thomsen brings an icy tension to the role, while Norby, as Christoffer's domineering mom, adds a chilling element of Greek tragedy to the story.",Fresh
"Telling and insightful, inventively filmed and extremely well-acted as usual ... but why are Danish films so relentlessly bleak?",Fresh
"In his role, Thomsen is strong and convincing.",Fresh
There's a major difference between Inheritance and The Godfather -- and that's a lack of epic and thematic sweep.,Rotten
"What makes The Inheritance so watchable, and so different from recent couples dramas like Closer, is that these privileged people are decent, likable and struggling to do the right thing.",Fresh
like updating Bergman for this millennium,Fresh
...there's absolutely no denying the effectiveness of Thomsen's heartbreaking performance...,Fresh
Dry interviews and soggy performances by the likes of Money Mark and Rick Wakeman of Yes don't do much to burnish Moog's legacy.,Rotten
Offers a fascinating historical look at the technological side of the 60's revolution in pop music.,Fresh
Somewhat cursory portrait.,Rotten
"The doc focuses exclusively on Robert Moog, and Robert Moog is, well, kind of boring.",Rotten
"Even at his most obtuse ... Moog's deep, almost spiritual connection to his creation is evident.",Fresh
"A collection of dry interviews and so-so music, it's better suited to public TV than the big screen.",Rotten
"If you're not fascinated by synthesized sound, this could be the longest seventy minutes of your life.",Rotten
An affectionate portrait of Robert Moog.,Fresh
Would that this affectionate tribute to the unassuming man behind a musical revolution had more energy of its own.,Rotten
"Largely, you get to watch a nice old guy waxing philosophical in his beloved vegetable garden, in his workshop or amid city traffic.",Rotten
Fjellestad exhibits a playful adoration for the man and the otherworldly sounds of his machine in an intriguing rendering of one of music technology's seminal figures.,Fresh
"The testimonials are plentiful, coming from the varied likes of prog-rock kings Rick Wakeman and Keith Emerson to current turntablists like DJ Spooky, Money Mark and Mix Master Mike.",Fresh
"There are things to be learned here, but it would take a real aficionado to geek out on all the knobs and circuit boards on display.",Rotten
"For every insight, there are a half-dozen meandering conversations and unguided reminiscences.",Rotten
It's unfortunate that there are so many ideas left behind before they get a chance to start,Rotten
"Haggis turns the screws on a nation's anxieties and helps light the way of personal responsibility through conversation and, if need be, a little divine intervention",Fresh
...surprisingly funny and touching...,Fresh
"Too bad that Crash, which aims to explore the complexities of contemporary interracial relations, is such a flawed film artistically, a schematic tale with blatant sociological messages. One of the weakest films to win the Best Picture Oscar.",Rotten
Feels perhaps a bit too much like Magnolia for its own good. But it's a solid film about seriously important issues.,Fresh
"Crash is hyper-articulate and often breathtakingly intelligent and always brazenly alive. I think it's easily the strongest American film since Clint Eastwood's Mystic River, though it is not for the fainthearted.",Fresh
I think this is the kind of film that starts arguments and stimulates passionate discussion about topics that still make most of us cringe.,Fresh
A crash course in unmasking the racial and class divisions in American society that make every stranger into a potential enemy.,Fresh
What happens between the film's opening and closing car accidents more closely resembles a train wreck.,Rotten
A promising but ultimately disappointing drama about California angst.,Rotten
"Easily the year's best: taut, credible, exciting drama of police corruption and more.",Fresh
"For all its candor and spare grit, the film is more than just in-your-face pedagogy about intolerance.",Fresh
Almost the entire movie consists of actors screaming at each other in Oscar-bait annoyance.,Rotten
...a gritty examination of misplaced tension and despair wrapped up in its makeshift boiling point...percolates with the right kind of toxic manipulation and complexity,Fresh
Crash is masterful film making...,Fresh
"Beautiful, intense, powerful and memorable...",Fresh
"Discomfiting is the only way to describe this smart, edgy drama rubbed raw by its own narrative anger.",Fresh
"Full of well-observed supporting riffs, Crash might've accumulated more frisson had it cast a clearer eye on how social tension actually plays.",Rotten
Crash's strength is that it deals intelligently with serious subjects.,Fresh
"Its large and talented cast chews up the scenery, packing every sentence with some racial insult.",Fresh
The script confronts prejudice with unvarnished nastiness.,Fresh
...has the kind of broad appeal that can draw large audiences and the kind of lingering emotional potency that can lead to serious soul-searching.,Fresh
"Despite its preachy moments, the film is a knockout. In a multiplex starved for ambition, why kick a film with an excess of it?",Fresh
"Haggis knows how to grab the viewer's attention, via intense confrontations as well as by planting dramatic seeds that bear fruit in, more often than not, grimly unexpected ways.",Fresh
"The stunning, must-see drama Crash is proof that words have not lost the ability to shock in our anesthetized society.",Fresh
"Though it lacks Magnolia's messy greatness, you won't hear more fiendishly articulate dialogue on-screen any time soon.",Fresh
The film's real message isn't anti-racism but pro-screenwriter. 'Look how many coincidences we can pile up!' it seems to say. 'Look at how these stories all interlock!',Rotten
"Sprawling Los Angeles drama of race, power, guns and fear is a little too controlled by coincidence, but the ambitions and cast make it thought-provoking.",Fresh
"By attempting to say everything about race, Haggis ultimately says nothing.",Rotten
This is a masterpiece of substantial proportions.,Fresh
Superbly crafted and visually stunning from start to finish,Fresh
[Helmer Paul Haggis] needs to develop a firmer hand on his own work to really shine.,Fresh
Crash is a movie you want to see for the great acting performances from some unlikely sources.,Fresh
"Haggis' scariest, most insidious success is that in surprising his audience with characters' paths, he makes us recognize our own expectations are built upon stereotypes",Fresh
"With an angry fist shaking in your face, the film asserts that we're all hard-wired to obey preset alarms when we interact with people of different skin tones.",Fresh
Haggis writes with such directness and such a good ear for everyday speech that the characters seem real and plausible after only a few words. His cast is uniformly strong; the actors sidestep cliches and make their characters particular.,Fresh
"The characters keep surprising themselves and each other, for better and for worse, and they surprise us, too.",Fresh
"While it's a dazzling feat of screenwriting, less would be more...Still, Haggis evinces remarkable skill [and] with actors like these, who needs subtleties?",Fresh
"In Crash, no one gets off easy, and no one is immune to prejudice.",Fresh
Audiences may cringe as Haggis taps into the kind of offensive images that surreptitiously seep into the brains of even the most open-minded. His point is simple: No one is immune.,Fresh
"It's a skillful piece of filmmaking and an impressive debut, though it's so relentlessly bleak and downbeat for most of its running time that it can't recover when it tries to go soft in its third act.",Rotten
"A grim, histrionic experiment in vehicular metaphor slaughter.",Rotten
"Lop off a few characters, tighten the narrative geometry, and Crash might have a sledgehammer impact. As it is, the film is content to tap you on the shoulder and ask you to take a look around.",Fresh
"So much feeling, so much skill, so much seriousness, such an urgent moral agenda -- all of this must surely answer our collective hunger for a good movie, or even a great one, about race and class in a modern American city. Not even close.",Rotten
Haggis challenges our common conceptions about race and allows no character to escape his own hypocrisy.,Fresh
"[The actors] can't quite make Haggis' preachy puppet show feel entirely organic, but they certainly take some of the glare off of the strings.",Rotten
"An absolutely riveting, highly charged drama, Crash is an important motion picture that demands viewing in high schools across the country.",Fresh
"Like that nerve-rattling collision of metal and glass, Crash will leave its audiences jarred awake, feeling bruised.",Fresh
"The straddling of styles [realism vs. fable] weakens, but doesn't destroy a strong film.",Fresh
Crash has been crafted to deliver a wake-up blow to our complacency.,Fresh
"A gorgeous mosaic of a movie that is actually about our fears of each other, set in the bright light of Los Angeles and the dark places in our hearts.",Fresh
"Dark, fluid thriller seasoned with acerbic dialogue and rueful observations that may strike uncomfortably close to home.",Fresh
"Although Haggis' sharp, surprisingly witty script admits there are no easy answers, it holds out hope that it's possible to change hateful behavior.",Fresh
"An intricate, explosive ensemble crime drama set in a modern urban pressure-cooker of racial and class hatreds.",Fresh
"People collide as well in this literate, engrossing and occasionally funny look at race relations in Los Angeles.",Fresh
"Not just one of the best Hollywood movies about race, but, along with Collateral, one of the finest portrayals of contemporary Los Angeles life period.",Fresh
"The film may be a trifle shallow in its treatment on its important topic, but it has an energy that carries you breathlessly along to a powerful conclusion.",Fresh
"It relies too much on coincidences and shock value over thematic depth, but at least it dares to be about something heavy.",Fresh
There's some great stuff there between all the object lessons; if only there were fewer of those to slog through.,Fresh
This movie did more than hold my interest. It touched my soul.,Fresh
"Haggis's drama is about much more than interlocking front-end collisions. It's about the way we learn, often badly, about one another and how it may take a bad confrontation to peel away the misperceptions.",Fresh
"This is the rare American film really about something, and almost all the performances are riveting. It asks tough questions, and lets its audience struggle with the answers.",Fresh
"Rather than feel reductively schematic, the film overall seems vividly complex and provocative in the true sense of the word -- it challenges viewers to reflect and discuss, rather than surrender to knee-jerk reactions.",Fresh
The best parts of Crash are as good as they are because they confront us with behaviour we might be capable of under the same circumstances. And we're not bad people. Are we?,Fresh
"And so Crash raises the question: If racism is so pervasive in our society, why do we need such an elaborately contrived plot to drive home the message? In other words: How many racists does it take to screw in the point?",Rotten
"Crash, Paul Haggis' flawed but riveting tale of racism in contemporary Los Angeles, has moments so powerful they're instantly seared into your memory; you'll watch without blinking, barely breathing.",Fresh
A mesmerizing urban drama that gets under the skin of racial intolerance more forcefully than any film since Spike Lee's Do the Right Thing,Fresh
"occasionally too willing to rely on convenience... (but) full of provocative ideas, shocking moments and wholly believable performances...",Fresh
"The story is obviously implausible, the writing sometimes glib, but just as often it's smart and vivid and has the ring of truth.",Fresh
Audiences everywhere are about to find out how abominably off-putting an extended diatribe masquerading as an ensemble drama can be.,Rotten
The lesson offered here seems geared toward those viewers who were surprised by the Rodney King video.,Rotten
"Its emotional lows and wicked below-the-belt punches make it a soul-searching film, a manipulative movie with a lot of stars and a writer-director staying on message throughout: We need to know each other better than this.",Fresh
Haggis' pedantic tone and obvious characterizations make it seem like he's better off adapting other people's work than creating his own.,Rotten
"Crash isn't set half-a-century ago, in some place of dusty roads and Skoal-spitting sheriffs. It takes place now, in Los Angeles, that most modern of American cities.",Fresh
Crash mercilessly apes Magnolia.,Rotten
"Exceptional performances and a powerful, multi-layered script make for simmering racial drama.",Fresh
"Contrived, obvious and overstated, Crash is basically just one white man's righteous attempt to make other white people feel as if they've confronted the problem of racism head-on.",Rotten
"If the setup often smacks of contrivance and coincidence, Haggis (in his directing debut) shows he's more than competent to balance the stories and give the film steamroller momentum.",Fresh
"Crash is almost machine-like in the way it parses out its screen time among its characters, its coincidence-laden plot dragging them along to events and situations with the certainty of Fate.",Fresh
"It's simultaneously shocking and riveting, but what makes this movie so mesmerizing is that it's never apparent where the actions of these characters will take us.",Fresh
"An ambitious and often wonderful movie, an expansive look at urban life -- the fractious, noisy whole of it -- filled with witty, biting and insightful writing.",Fresh
